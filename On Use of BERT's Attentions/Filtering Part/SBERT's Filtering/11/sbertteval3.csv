"The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions. This movie was great, and I suggest that you go see it before you judge. I was wrong.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film starts with some creative opening credits ( imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO's "" Carnivale "" and "" Rome "" ), but lumbers along slowly for its first by - the - numbers hour. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players'heads under pressure. Despite the formulaic nature, this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience. Once the action moves to the U. S. Open things pick up very well. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive here. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period - piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century.",1
"There's one little Disney moment at pool table ; otherwise, the viewer does not really think Disney. < br / > < br / > Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed.",1
"I saw this film in a sneak preview, and it is delightful. < br / > < br / > This is one I'd recommend to anyone. He does a marvelous, self - contained, job as the lead. If this movie does not do well, it won't be because it doesn't deserve to. Before this film, I didn't realize how charming Shia Lebouf could be. Sports movies are a dim a dozen, but this one stands out.",1
< br / > < br / > The acting is exemplary throughout.,1
Heartland gave that award to this film. < br / > < br / > And the story is inspirational.,1
"< br / > < br / > It's fabulous that he's off of drugs now, but he's no hero. He lies on the grass coming down from ( during? ) and that would make it a little biased. Huh? I think the best view would have been told from Hongsheng's family and friends'perspectives.",1
I found the Jia Hongsheng story interesting.,1
"However, this movie is not for everyone.",1
"He says "" I had to get high to do what director wanted. "" The perfect recipe for his enablers. So, his shallow identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. He was hot in the early nineties. "" He's a talented actor, impressionable, vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally starved. Soon he's "" cool "" actor, idolized by youth. """,1
I loved this movie from beginning to end. < br / > < br / > This Movie Blew ME AWAY! I Give It Threehumbs Way Up! lol. I just saw it on the Ifc channel. It changed my life.,1
I was fortunate to attend the London premier of this film. I was in tears by the end of the film. Every scene was mesmerizing.,1
But it really was a worth while watch. This movie did all those things to me and more. There are NO loopholes ( in my opinion ). I first saw this movie on IFC. < br / > < br / > The atmosphere of the film is also great.,1
"Since family is the # 1 priority in the Asian culture, it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him / her. It shows the genuineness of the movie.",1
As I watched it I found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him. < br / > < br / > A must see for someone in mental health profession!,1
"So does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film. The music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after. < br / > < br / > Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some Chinese action films late eighties start nineties. I saw this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002. We really feel pain and struggle Jia is in. Later you can see him in great films such as Frozen and Suzhou River. < br / > < br / > The film has a heavy feel, but scenes of Jia cycling through Bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone.",1
"7 out of 10 and that's being kind. On a highway outside of town, she meets a young man, who stops and picks her up. "" Give it a look only if you are a fan of Jean Rollin'works. "" Night of the Hunted "" stars French porn star Brigitte Lahaie.",1
"For once, there's not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight! True to tradition, the budget proved way too tight to realize the director's vision entirely. < br / > < br / > When Robert leaves for work, he's inevitably erased from Elisabeth's feeble mind.",1
"There are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead, bit more dodgey, perhaps, but most effective. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this.",1
"I was really impressed. Groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity. Very metropolitan. < br / > < br / > 8 out of 10, kids.",1
"The revelation as to what's going on comes in the last few moments of the movie, which has a rather strange yet touching end to it. I like this one a lot, check it out. Except it's in French with subtitles of course. Still though, that doesn't prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to Paris & his apartment. 8 out of 10.",1
"In the end, though, through luck, Felix is discovered and offered a movie contract. < br / > < br / > Felix meets a guy whose shoe business is folding because he can't sell any shoes. Hurray! That's because despite its age, the cartoon is very creative and funny. In gratitude, the guy gives Felix $ 500! < br / > < br / > Once there, Felix barges into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself.",1
"The four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down - to - earth. The independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger.",1
"Most highly recommended. Given that Felix started out in newspapers as a comic strip, this device is a natural.",1
"He's in tears. My kingdom for a ham sandwich!!! "" Felix thinks, "" How does he expect me to get the money? "" Crazy stuff.",1
"It'overall pretty good, if not a little over - the - top.",1
"Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.",1
"This is one of Errol Flynn's signature roles and one of Raoul Walsh's greatest epics. They appeared as a couple in seven previous films. Naturally, the volatile Custer attacks Sharp in a public brawl. Indeed, Sheridan was a lieutenant at this point.",1
"So I guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress. If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining.",1
This reunion is a happy thing for cinematography.,1
"This is what I considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable. Custer ranked 34 in a graduating class of... 34. the cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroic. I first viewed "" They Died With There Boots On "", about 1970 and though it has been many years since, this film and its impression remain.",1
I was fortunate to attend the London premier of this film. I was in tears by the end of the film. Every scene was mesmerizing.,1
"Ford taught us in "" Liberty Valance "" to believe the legend before the truth. Here I think we're closer to the legend of the legend but hey, it's only a movie and a rollicking, wonderfully enjoyable classic Hollywood movie at that!",1
"< br / > < br / > ALTHOUGH both pictures were starring vehicles for Errol Flynn, there was a change in the casting the part of General Custer. ( or Jeb ) Stuart ; Errol took on the Custer part for THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON.",1
"He literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts heart of his loyal heroine. < br / > < br / > Flynn, who cleverly plays Custer as though he is one part Arnold Schwartzenegger to two parts Albert Schweitzer, has never been more ignoble. Warner's DVD is pretty nice looking.",1
The film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight. Arthur Kennedy never more villainous. It had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout.,1
"Custer intends to court her, but the outbreak of the Civil War calls him away.",1
One of the best movies I have ever seen! Loosen up!,1
"Their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance. The script, at times, was corny, although the movie was still enjoyable to watch. The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. Her character will definitely make you laugh. This movie is good for entertainment purposes, but it is not historically reliable. Some will watch this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others will watch this movie and learn hate him.",1
"< br / > < br / > 4 ) Custer'stand against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky. And for the most part my expectations were fulfilled ( in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way ). < br / > < br / > 3 ) Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. Just having someone like Errol Flynn play Custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production. I half - expected to see the Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello wander into the scene. < br / > < br / > 2 ) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed as much to Custer's cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor ; there are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point where he seems downright stupid. < br / > < br / > 5 ) Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored. Naturally, along with everyone else, I was primed to expect a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON over the legend of Custer.",1
"No its not exciting, but it is gripping if you can empathise with these characters. So keira knightly is in it... < br / > < br / > GO ON!! So automatically we compare this film to attonement. give it a go!",1
( Flynn and DeHavilland were very fond of each other in real life ).,1
Not to forget the ever reliable O. de Havilland as Lady Mary of the west.,1
The saving grace of this film is its humour.,1
"this is awesome!!! patriotic, for all the right reasons. there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this. Raoul Walsh is an under - rated genius, his direction is so sweeping, so broad, yet so intimate. there is no partnership quite like Errol, and Olivia.",1
"Custer returns to his hometown, marries his sweetheart, Libby who is played by Olivia De Havilland. Through an error, Custer receives a promotion in rank. Before this can be corrected, he leads a Union regiment into battle against the Confederates. < br / > < br / > Errol Flynn dominates each scene in which he appears. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero.",1
His record leading the Michigan Regiment under his command was one of brilliance. During that time she was the custodian of the Custer legend. I'm not sure they ever met.,1
"I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was! ! < br / > < br / > I'll give this film 10 out of 10!",1
This remains the best film made about Custer.,1
"< br / > < br / > Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn. John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it. < br / > < br / > So we get the view that he was a hot - spur, but he was patriotic. ), and national hero. This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10.",1
"Performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers. The lives of four friends. Can you capture the moment? When first you hear rain on a roof? The things that matter. Writer Sharman Macdonald has taken a different, better approach. The purity of their former passion. A simple biopic could have missed the point. The soundtrack leaves you wanting for more. Vera. ( Bob Dylan named himself after him ).",1
"The movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate, and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say, JFK. ( They all started together with Captain Blood and The Charge of the Light Brigade - both terrific - so we can't really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh. )",1
The film's battle scenes are excellent.,1
Pure beauty and genius.,1
Nicole Finn ( Madonna ) is just being released from prison. This film is a wild trip down comedy avenue. You will both be cheerio pronto. Is there a way out of the madness?,1
"you wanna tell me it wasn't her best movie ever? if you like "" Who's That Girl? """,1
"It is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun. One of them, as well as Madonna, was panned by the critics. < br / > < br / > This film mistaken.",1
Bottom line : She knows how to enjoy life. She'the girl for me.,1
"But Who's That Girl? is not a deep film. I've watched it when I was younger. Haviland Morris also stars. But it is entertaining, nonetheless. Overall, a delight!",1
It is no better or no worse than any chees 80's flick. Madonna is a goddess!! ! The soundtrack is excellent too.,1
In this TV special Jon is the one who needs a life. The highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer.,1
This movie is so good!,1
"- "" Thanks! "" For late - 80s cheese, this really isn't so bad. Oh well.",1
And the happy ending!,1
Give the film a shot.,1
"Madonna gets into action, again and she fails again! The truth isthat Madonna failed as an actress'cause the script was quite weak. At the end, it's very funny to watch it.",1
"I think it is a nice little comedy and really funny. But it's their problem, not of the film. And Madonna can act.",1
"< br / > < br / > Griffin Dunne ( whatever happened to him? When she gets out she decides to seek revenge. Clear. "" ), plays an attorney for his fiancée's father ( John McMartin ). "" < br / > < br / > Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman jailed for a crime she didn't commit. "" < br / > < br / > I loved the film back then and I love it today.",1
"I love this movie! So does Madonna in this film, and just entirely! ! Her acting is superb! It's classic. * ALANiS Rocks *.",1
No avail. A singles'bar was a great place to start. Literally. Garfield was jealous of Mona for fear that she would take Jon away from him. Jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. [ CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! ] Jon sat next to a pretty girl named Mona. It was hopeless. Jon and Garfield attend the class.,1
Everyone always enjoyed it.,1
Hilarious! I kid you not. That's how some of best comedy should be played - straight. on his roof. Throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of WTG. < br / > < br / > Madonna is the queen of deadpan acting.,1
"If you like Madonna or not, this movie is hilarious! !",1
"So, Madonna isn't Meryl Streep. ? Still, this is one of her first films and a comedy at that. Madonna - bashing is so 90's. Give her a break!",1
"< br / > < br / > "" Who's That Girl? "" 6 /. On its own, its not that bad.",1
Even the Jamaican thugs are a sight to behold. The whole cast is wonderful. He'very good in a small role as Bracco's pimp.,1
I hope it lasts. I LOVED this movie.,1
I'm very glad I saw this movie - it was just too nice to miss! I know I did. I would credit this to two very charismatic people.,1
This was a great movie! Technical details?,1
"It is pure 100 % adolescent fun. Is this a bad movie? If you are going to watch only one "" Babes in Bikini "" movie, this is it. < br / > < br / > There were lots of BABES in and out of bikinis.",1
"I ` ve seen this movie twice, both times on Cinemax.",1
It's more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery. Watch it twice if you can.,1
"Silence follows. But what I love most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits. Or ANY sort of movie fan! It has twist, turns, and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense. An easy 10 / 10. As time goes on at home, the evil Stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls. The soundtrack is faultless, the furnishings in the house, and the use of colour are fantastic.",1
!,1
"It's a hell of a puzzle. Tale of Two Sisters "" has to be one of the creepiest films I've seen recently.",1
Very creepy! The sisters seem very hostile towards their mother - especially the elder one - and they seem to ignore their father.,1
Very little. It is not a perfect film. What follows after that is the movie.,1
Creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies. I was really surprised at the depth of this movie. With the characters nicely fleshed out. So I'll just leave it at that.,1
Then they made a movie out of it. ! IF You're EVER GONNA SEE A NORWEGIAN MOVIE.,1
i love horror movies that revolve around a house. the characters are extremely believable. this movie will be a another great example that i will remember. i would definitely look out for this on DVD.,1
I thought the movie was just a drama.,1
The idea is not original... !,1
"Don't miss! It's actually typical with Korean and Japanese movies. < br / > < br / > Like Ring, a tale of two sister doesn't overdo ghastly appearance. ).",1
"But you never can. Soo - mi says "" Do you know what's really scary? The stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant but it is obvious that it is Soo - mi who is really hurting. To most of us, life is an unfolding process of love. There is a time line but it is left for the viewer to unravel.",1
"It was so sad. Said, done. Well, I saw the title "" A tale of two sisters "" which sounded very interesting. Three words : Piece of Art. And the ending scene made me cry... it just made me cry. This film is just great.",1
So the film seems to be at its most external layer.,1
"Unfortunately due to the type of movie this is, there is And the satisfaction from solving a puzzle like that is wonderful.",1
"Even when the final conclusion is revealed, it is not so heavy - handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place. This movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror, but not for obvious reasons. Some things will still be open to interpretation, and this is one of joys of watching a film such as this. Indeed, it would be a mistake to align "" A Tale Of Two Sisters "" with films like "" Ringu "" and "" The Grudge "".",1
This movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be. Every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie. And don't forget to switch the light off.,1
I hate cars! !,1
A beautiful short film. I understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for.,1
"One to watch again and again, if only to work it all out. The tension rises and there is the inevitable snap. Many horror fans complain that horror has scarcely progressed in the last twenty years. But what happens after this requires more than pair of eyes, as the story takes several twists, and the scares become more emotional and quite real.",1
"The narrative only becomes confusing for some because, midway through the final third, the story switches from a purely subjective setting ( ie.",1
"My vote is eight. I watch many movies, but presently my genre number one is Asian horror.",1
"says he angrily, "" Su - mi, please. < br / > < br / > After the dinner, the conflict between Eun - joo and the sisters becomes at its worst. < br / > < br / > Listening to their talk, the brother's wife has a panic. < br / > < br / > To tell the truth, I hate But his response is unexpected. "" Give me a break. "" Eun - joo pulls Su - yeon into a wardrobe and locks her in it. Eun - joo ( YEOM Jeong - ah ) welcomes them but Su - mi's manner is bitter to her.",1
"The large house adds eeriness, and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat. < br / > < br / > Highly recommended viewing in my opinion, real joy and scare...",1
"I just saw "" A Tale of Two Sisters "" last night and really enjoyed it. < br / > < br / > Here's my interpretation of the film. The initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of Su - Mi. However, I think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together. I've been a big fan of Asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from South Korea.",1
"In reality, however, nothing could be further from the truth. It'quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable. How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?",1
Do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film.,1
"Perhaps I'm one of the only avid horror fans who thinks that the recent overload of Asian shockers is so over - hyped! A Tale of Two Sisters "" is a terrific movie - adventure and a definite must see for Asian film fanatics. This is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terror - tale that REALLY gets under your skin! The mansion were the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated like a truly creepy place where secrets and danger lurk behind every door. Well, this blunt opinion doesn't go for the South Korean gem "" A Tale of Two Sisters "". Several sequences ( like the dinner with relatives or the nightly appearance in the girls'room ) are pretty much ultimate in eeriness. A little warning for people with a short attention - span, though : this movie forces you to have your eyes and ears focused at at all time. It's also a film that requires repeated viewing, even though no one will never really "" get it "" for a full 100 %.",1
"There are only four main characters, but the intrigue surrounding them is intense. The Beauty. The Guilt. < br / > < br / > Maybe that's just about all I should write in this comment for A TALE OF TWO SISTERS. The best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it.",1
Hehehe. It was hiious.,1
"The house, where the film takes place looks incredibly menacing and isolated. "" The plot is slightly confusing, but some scenes are wonderful eerie. "" Watch this masterpiece as soon as possible. My rating : 10 out of 10.",1
"I would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant. Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e - bay or similar. The ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can cope. Viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.",1
"These two girls were magical on screen. A Tale of Two Sisters ', or'Janghwa, Hongryeon ', is a true masterpiece. < br / > < br / > I truly love this film. ' I will certainly be looking into their other films. It is a real gem, worthy of anyone's collection.",1
Ive had real life experiance with a boy like'Radio '. This movie is really true and i can identify with it 100 %.,1
"Sure, there could have been more character development. And bring your Kleenex. You won't be disappointed. A lesson we all need to me reminded of. 8 / 10 Not many.",1
There's enough for both.,1
High recommended!,1
SO WHAT! < br / > < br / > Yes the movie tugs at the heartstrings. His review is callous and totally uncalled for! He was teaching us. Coach Harris will not let the < br / > < br / > This is a solid cast.,1
!,1
"It is truly one of my great "" guilty pleasure "". A worthwhile moodpiece.",1
"I just got home from seeing "" Radio. """,1
"This is a very moving movie about life itself. "".",1
I wish Hollywood would produce more movies of this cabre.,1
And Ed Harris will win for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR. < br / > < br / > It was 1976.,1
It definitely is one of the year's best films of 2003. Radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. Coach Jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game.,1
Any of these people could have been people I knew. you won't find it in this movie. This is a movie you'll either love or hate. I loved it. I know people like these.,1
But it had me pretty close to tears.,1
"RAdio. "" Ed Harris also did a fantastic job as Coach Jones.",1
Radio is an inspiration. This movie is a real life fairy tale and not to be missed. Gooding flawless. People did not understand ; nor did they want to understand. Ed Harris was his usual brilliance.,1
"Just a lot of nudity and silly dialog. ""... "" I can see you better naked! "", the film shambles along plotlessly up until the less - than - spectacular finale.",1
"< br / > < br / > The mentally challenged young man called James Robert Kennedy, always walk around the T. L. Hanna High School, without bothering anyone and almost not noticed. Ed Harris is great as Harold Jones, but this actor IS great, so this is not anything new. One day, Cash decides to punish James, mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up. < br / > < br / > Cuba Gooding, Jr. is excellent as Radio! Radio has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone, and that's a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives. It has a life lesson, specially showing us how a person can make a difference, even not being what we call'' normal''.",1
"Cuba Gooding Jr. is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man. Mr. Harris, one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he graces with his presence. < br / > < br / > The supporting cast is excellent. Michael Tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us. Coming from a poor background, Radio, lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the coach's intentions. Debra Winger, only has a few scenes in the film.",1
It's a heart - warming story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care. I think there was a lot of realism with the characters.,1
"Gooding does a nice job with the role, too. The story takes place in the mid 1970s in South Carolina. Mainly, I was referring to Ed Harris'role as "" Coach Jones. """,1
"< br / > < br / > The fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the more heartwarming. Very well done to all. 7 out of 10. < br / > < br / > Debra Wing, we need more of you in pictures!",1
"Corniness Warning. He let me borrow it and I watched it in my room. He's got his own collection. The boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly. The next day, I went off to Blockbuster and bought the DVD. It was for Radio.",1
It deserves nothing less! This is one of the best films I have ever seen! I definitely give this movie a 10.,1
I wish they made more movies like this... Radio is the Real Deal! ! He WAS the film!,1
"Well it does, but certainly not what you'd expect. First - class movie. Denmark.",1
And he did not die in vain. Macy didn't know what is really going on and what will be the outcome but did what he was expected to do. She left military life at the end. She did understand him. ! It was his way out. He choose it. Truth is something completely different.,1
Recommended! It is rich and colorful.,1
"I found myself waiting for THEIR affair to begin, if only because they look so good together.",1
"We'll need those Marines then, even if they aren't always the best champions of fair play internally. You're lucky if you know where you're at most of the time. Well, after all, this is rather a suspense story, so you'll have to see for yourself. < br / > < br / > The verdict? Sure, "" war is hell "", but sometimes it can't be avoided.",1
"Anne Heche was utterly convincing. The marines let principles be damned. Totally believable. I sat riveted to the TV screen. He knew what his true course of action had to be. Excellent cast, story line, performances. But this movie brought fear to my heart.",1
I give the movie a 9 out of 10. The scene in Albert Hall is a classic.,1
"Absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene. It very excellent none the less. 8 out of 10. Also, the use of Doris Day singing "" Que Sera, Sera "" was excellent.",1
< br / > < br / > I rated this movie 8 out of 10. Bernard Herrmann appears as himself near the climax.,1
"Some people say the pace of this film is a little slow, but how is this different from any other Hitchcock movie? This is, of course the basic definition of the Albert Hall sequence, as well as the shorter staircase sequence at the end of picture.",1
"I However, even though the American version was ( heaven forbid! ) Yes Doris Day. I don't want to spoil anything, but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed. Leslie Banks in the original is nothing in comparison. And the assassin was truly frightening. It elevated the film to another level. 1956's The Man Who Knew Too Much is exceptional entertainment.",1
"4! < br / > < br / > And this tension still works for me, today.",1
"While the footage rolls, Al and Annie start making out. The film has a lot going for it. I kid you not. Al and Annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene. Ridiculous. and they have an orgy of sorts in helicopter, in mid - air. We later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola. They sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen. Is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way?",1
"It's Hitchcock - light, but recommended. These qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story.",1
Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world famous singer. The rest of the film is a puzzle as Stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. Hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.,1
This Film is the One which you fall in love with.,1
The only flaw in 1956 film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop. ).,1
"He will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family. I prefer it over "" Vertigo "" and "" Rear Window. """,1
"This isn't among my favorite Hitchcock films, though I must admit it's still pretty good. Sorry.",1
"< br / > < br / > My Score : 8 / 10. If there's one good suspenseful film, this is one of them.",1
Her performance is Oscar worthy.,1
"I loved little bit of comedy at the end that Alfred added. < br / > < br / > The acting again, I would say that Dorris was the one who outshined the whole cast. You'll see what I mean.",1
"There is also added bonus of Que Sera Sera, which turned out to be a smash hit for Doris Day. A fine film.",1
"It is truly one of my great "" guilty pleasure "". A worthwhile moodpiece.",1
Ostensibly a story about the young child of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. The kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet. It isn ' The scene ends with Stewart rushing out the door.,1
"Neither film is a big deal, but both are easy to enjoy. The impish Hitchcock of course lets us know what that point is, so that the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail biting race against the cymbalist.",1
James Stewart is marvelous. This movie is fifty years old now.,1
"In a bus they know a sympathetic French person ( Daniel Gelin, in the old version Pierre Fresnay ). Then the child is abducted to ensure their silence and McKenna gets help to Morocco's Inspector Buchanan ( Ralph Truman ). Rating : better than average, Hitchcock'enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy it. This exciting film displays suspense, intrigue, tension, and interesting drama well written by John Michael Hayes and Charles Bennett. The story was ferociously reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining.",1

"She sings! By contrast, all of Stewart's masculine activity is counterprod < br / > < br / > After their son has been kidnapped, Stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news. At the Albert Hall, it is her need to cry out, to exercise those impressive lungs, that saves a man's life, and in the Embassy finale, it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son. This seems to be a mutual decision, and she doesn't appear to be unhappy.",1
Doris Day is very believable in the role of an atypical Hitchcock blond. I thought there was nothing fake about her performance.,1
"His wife is the lovely Doris Day at her best. The Man Who Knew Too Much "" is change of pace for Hitchcock's fans.",1
But the Goodtimes version is pretty crappy. There are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen. Gail Osborne is new in town.,1
The film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of kidnappinghow to get the little boy back safely...,1
"While there, they meet a French man on the bus and another middle - aged couple in a restaurant. In fact, I would even go as far as to say that this is the most paranoid film that Hitchcock ever made. That being said, this remake, although definitely better, still isn't among Hitchcock's best work. < br / > < br / > The original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic Peter Lorre. However, things go awry when the French man dies from a knife in the back, shortly after whispering something to doctor.",1
Stewart and Day play off each other beautifully in that scene. < br / > < br / > I do wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. The original film was shot inside a studio. Their child is snatched in order to insure their silence.,1

Was it real or maybe dream? He'd go around solving crimes and the lot. There was a geeky kid who's computer somehow created this guy - automan.,1
This movie is amazing. It's a target.,1
Tan as lead is nothing less than magnificent. His choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. Tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad.,1

Lehman embarks on an all - out killing spree.,1
"WESTERN UNION qualified on both requisites. He remained in France ; eventually immigrating to the United States of America. < br / > < br / > HEADING up the playbill are Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore. Included in thismörgåsbord of titles is today's lucky subject, WESTERN UNION ( 20th Century - Fox, 1941 ).",1
"Okay, I love this movie!!!!! If it comes on TV watch it. But who did it?",1
"Additionally, he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life.",1
"So, it's up to either Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day. Strange, yes, but it seemed to work out okay, though I wonder how this great German director felt about being given this job. His forte was drama - - and I guess this movie is a drama of sorts - - just set in the old West.",1
Lots of great character actors help keep large production moving forward.,1
"This is a sort of hidden gem. At very least this is damned good western! It has tense drama, sprinklings of humor and great effects.",1
"< br / > < br / > This is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtly. Shaw ends up helping Creighton on his way to civilization, then disappears.",1
I give it a double A +. One of the best western movies ever made.,1
"Both Young and Scott become friends, but rivals for Jagger's sister Virginia Gilmore. Young is doing one of his few loan out films away from MGM for 20th Century Fox. They both provide some good comic relief. Later on he's hired by Western Union and works for Jagger. Western Union is solid western entertainment.",1
"The movie in no way resembles the novel. It led me to the superb historical novels of Kenneth Roberts. I, too, wish it would be released on DVD. "" Something just resonates with them. That film is Northwest Passage.",1
"Western Union "" is one of Randolph Scott's great westerns. Ms. Gilmore had a short career in movies. < br / > < br / > The supporting cast is superb. The Frank James movie equals "" Jesse James "". """,1
It's a pretty good western and Lang should of directed some more western.,1
"However, his past haunts him when the outlaw Jack Slade ( Barton MacLane ) steals the Western Union cattle disguised of Indians. Randolph Scott gives another magnificent performance with a great cast.",1
"However, MacLane makes him a memorably evil, and totally vicious type. Look at the sequence with Chill Wills, where he is on a telegraph pole repairing it. He was hanged in the 1870s. At least, that is how audiences would see it. But he does become a close friend of Shaw, especially in trying to confront Slade. But Lang is responsible for that, as well as other touches.",1
"He died in 1998 at the age of 91. The female lead is taken by Virginia Gilmore who really has little to do in the picture. "" < br / > < br / > It is curious that Robert Young has top billing over Scott! Western Union "" is something of a forgotten classic western! He just looks plain silly going up against Barton McLane in a gunfight! It beggars belief! Her presence here is merely cosmetic.",1
"This must be a convention for movies with underground settlements. But it'entertaining enough for a repeat view. Well, maybe. Not much in tune with the Canadian psyche, eh? )",1
< br / > < br / > Another idea would be the foundation of new Midian.,1
And it's held up quite well over the years. Nightbreed blew my mind the first time I saw it.,1
"But it's plain to see that if humans left them alone, Nightbreed in turn not bother with them. She tries in her own small way to be a bridge to humankind. < br / > < br / > Clive Barker's been an out gay man for some time now and some have suggested to me that the Nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people. < br / > < br / > Back in the old days, the folks who inhabit Midian would have been called Zombies, the undead. < br / > < br / > Clive Barker's creatures are a pretty gruesome looking lot and are not particularly fond of humans.",1
"This was only Anne Bobby'third film, and she was good also. Ha! Nothing spectacular, but fair. It took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground.",1
"And without that, nada. 7 out 10. A flawed really quite good movie.",1
"The film'Nightbreed'is one of the best horror films I have ever seen. If you haven't seen this film, I recommend you watch it, as I rate it a 10 / 10.",1
I experienced Nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with the results. The practically Klan - like human insurgence ( pitchforks and holy wrath! ) We have a genuine forgotten gem here and the sooner studio and Mr Barker make nice and devote some time to it - the better. ).,1
"Unaware of this situation, Decker claims to be a purist which he's only a hate - monger in disguise. Boone however, goes into Midian and make the claim that he's one of the mutants there. Rating 3. Lori saves a mutant from the sun, and in return helps the others as well. But a mutant named Peloquin ( Oliver Parker ) sees Boone as meat!",1
This is Clive Barker's masterpiece in my opinion.,1
< br / > < br / > That having been said I love this movie. He ends up with a card stuck to his chest. It was very interesting. A much more involved story that sadly has never has a chance to live. It simply isn't. Whenever I watch it I find something new. I will give that this movie could have been better.,1
This movie was made for Barker fans. You might find a new respect for the movie. Two thumbs up Clive.,1
I absolutely love this movie. One is. Who are the monsters of this world?,1
"It's a horror story alright. And it is Decker & c who are the bad guys. While the monsters, are human and prey. ).",1
Does any additional information on the subject actually exist?,1
"We soon learn that we were wrong all along. Nightbreed "" is a horse of a different color. I was not let down. "" This IS Clive Barker at his finest.",1
"what can I say.... after that they were kept in a safe!!! 'Getting the whack ', some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the canes! Highly recommended.",1
I enjoyed this film. This is definitely a unique film and not crap.,1
"9 / 10 Craig Scheffer is excellent as the lead character of Boone. The visual are good, and in some shots great. As good as Scheffer is, Cronenberg is even better.",1
I'd be curious to know how much was purely his design. His novels tend to wander a bit. I like the way Barker simply presents it. There it is. I also think Barker works best with short stories. Always has. And fantasy just isn't my bag. I love love love love it. The way the mask talked to him and controlled him.,1
"When Dr. Decker also finds out about this place, chaos ensues. The bite causes him to live, and he goes off to Midian. The shots in the movie are also set up beautifully. It's odd for a horror film to be this well done. But Boone isn't dead.",1
"There'even a cool cameo by 50's and 60's sci - fi star John Agar. < br / > < br / > Great supporting performances add to the fun. Barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters. The visual and makeup effects are elaborate, and production design and cinematography quite impressive. It's colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in. Craig Sheffer plays Boone, a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer.",1
"The make - up is awesome, the story is lovely. I really don't know what would be comparable...",1
About fantasy! This is a movie about the monsters! There is truly nothing else out there like it!,1
"An amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. For the horror genre, it has quite a few of subtle symbolic and references. And, not to forget, a nice music score.",1
"Worth look! As happens in most classic monster movies, the villagers surround the monsters'castle with torches and pitchforks. In this one, the monsters ( the night breed of the title ) are the "" good "" guys. It also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by Barker.",1
"He raises the locals on an all out assault on Midian, like a holy war in gods name led by the devil. Is he making it up or are they real and calling to him? The monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone, but man is hunting them. His Pyschologist ( Chroneburg ) convinces him he's a murderer, a slayer of families. Nightbreed turns genre on it's head. < br / > < br / > But Decker isn't about to let Boone continue on.",1
"< br / > < br / > There is definitely moral here, but of a rather different kind than the standard Hollywood in - your - face - at - the - end - of - the - movie sort of display. < br / > < br / > All in all, this is a great movie, provided that you don't expect it to be a standard horror movie. I'm not sure they are entirely to blame for their rickety appearance and lack of depth, though, seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to screenplay. Summing that moral up is simple, even though it is not quite that simply displayed ; prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different.",1
I was very impressed by this movie. There was great acting in it too. This movie is one of my favorites.,1
This is a movie with lasting effect. This is a story of a long and awkward love. He works at the City Hall and devotedly cares her at home.,1
"The storyline of The Milkwoman is a simple one of unrequited love that despite the passing of decades still remains strong. The director handles this marvellously with a strong structure and visual style. It's all validated by the emotional depths the film touches, represented most effectively in the exceptional performance of Yuko Tanaka.",1
"There's no eye contact, save for cursory glances by chance, and little acknowledgement of each other's existence. Besides immersing herself in two jobs, she has those books which serve as a form of escapism, and occasionally pens little sweet nothings to song dedication shows on the radio.",1
"Minako and Kaita were high school sweethearts who, courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents, separated ways since then. Such unhurried development may not suit viewers weaned on fast - paced narratives but for the rest, it's a heartfelt introspection that affects powerfully and emphatically. Lead actor Yuko Tanaka fulfills so much in the exceptionally meditative "" The Milkwoman, "" a tranquil canvass on missed chances in the life of a 50 - something woman, charting her routine with sincerely poignant motives.",1
The film actually has some major narrative problems. The climactic sequence is also really forced.,1
"Moreover, this one has a Motown soundtrack. For starters, in "" AG "", everyone was white, whereas in "" CH "" they're all black. The movie deals mainly with home life and relationships. A classic in the real sense of the word.",1
You'll recall with fondness your best friends from school. You want a movie that'll take you places? Well this is a good pick.,1
"Their loss - this is a fine, fine film. is testament to just how little cared - for excellent film is.",1
"Watch it and see. Does he ever get his wish? This is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who has < br / > < br / > ever been in love, or ever wanted to be. Postwar England, the dawn of the "" atomic age "".",1
"Great Film, enjoy.",1
The hits just kept coming. It was a reflection of high school life back in the day.,1
"The police pursue them and they are arrested. Both of these boys have promising futures. The humor of that show was very broad, but still funny. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. 'which aired on ABC from 1976 - 1979. Preach is a great writer but a lazy student, and Cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. But thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher ( SNL's Garrett Morris ) they are released.",1
"I liked it a great deal - it just has no real connection to this film. "" Highly recommended.",1
All of the cast of this movie was great.,1
That is a staple of a good movie.,1
"Glynn Turman is wonderful as Preach and Lawrence Hilton - Jacobs is great as Preach's friend Cochise. There are a lot of scenes in this film that I like a lot. "" ! Cooley High "" is one of my favorite movies EVER!!! It is a lot of fun as well!! Go out and rent or buy this movie, and be ready for a load of comical entertainment!!! Get the soundtrack, too.",1
I'm glad that I was around to witness some of the goings on of era. I was 4 years old at the time and saw it at a drive - in theatre. This was the very first movie I ever saw in my life back in 1974 or 1975.,1
"Boys 2 Men, however, named their hit record after this film. It's an embarrassing disgrace. < br / > < br / > It makes me mad that people don't know this.",1
This film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess. P'tang Yang Kipperbang is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a 12 year old. 10 out of 10. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH!,1
"The biggest example of this is "" Boyz The Hood "".",1
"This is a very weird film and probably not suitable for about 99 % of the average cinema - loving audiences. It's all a matter of profiling and good marketing, I guess. Just he starts to believe in actual love, she strikes back with a vengeance. If you're part of that remaining 1 %, however, you're in for a really unique treat.",1
"Sayer retreats to his palatial estate, running Maria through a humiliating series of mind games, threatening to molest and kill her.",1
"You may not know this film just yet, but trust me, once seen you'll never forget it!! ! Nothing is what it seems however in this sick and imaginative gem of a movie with several truly erotic moments achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity.",1
"This movie simply oozes psychedelia influenced late 60s Italian cinema. So, pseudo serious and sexually free.",1
"Its more of a light, fun pop art affair, lovable but insubstantial, like bubble bath. The music, by Stelvo Cipriani is gnarly too, perfectly suited to the images. Director Pierro Schivazappa has come up with quite a cracker here, but its not perfect.",1
"Therefore, for the first half of the narrative, we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation at Leroy ’ s hands ( including being forced to make love to a dummy in his own image! )",1
And this is exactly the part that makes it worth seeing.,1
"The film is by and large episodic. Eddie then has to make his way home in the nude ( surprisingly, there is less nudity here than there was in Episode 2 Season 2 ). It opens with a stirring patriotic speech lauding the virtues of England's green and pleasant land, then cuts to a shot of Eddie and Bill walking up a street, arguing furiously. < br / > < br / > The climax to Episode 1 Season 1 reappears in an expanded form. The thing is, can Bill and Eddie stay friends long enough to win it? That's the main part of the plot. One chunk is lifted directly from Season 1, namely Bill and Eddie going to the Club pretending to be on'union business '.",1
"There were 41 reviews, average 5 stars. com - - 3 discs - - for between $ 19 - 21, to be viewed on DVD in the US format, no hacking.",1
However the cast are as great as usual.,1
"It can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love, like Puck in a "" Mid - summer Night's Dream "". High marks for art design! On top of the merry mix - up, Max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago. After four collisions it ceases to have any impact, if you'll excuse the pun. There is much running down corridors, stairways, through doorways, into elevators etc. However a kiss or two soon makes him feel better.",1
She gives him also no love but only stability. A movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot.,1
"Netflix let me down, so I ended up getting a copy from some website in Ireland. And I've just watched it. A classic French film. ).",1
I loved this.,1
the story reminded me a bit of alfred hitchcock's vertigo. be prepared to be confused.,1
"However with that said, I was really disappointed in l'apartment's ending.",1
"At the centre is Vinz Cassell's portrayal of Max. He has presence and diversity in abundance. A starry - eyed Romeo, he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger Lisa ( Bellucci ). Yet fate seems to have it in for them, and the audience is captivatingly teased.",1
? She would not be out of place breaking Lon Chaney'heart.,1
A little cult! Even if not so publicized it could be remembered for several reason.,1
"For me this is simply a haunting, elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web. The plot from Gilles Mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires. The theme from Peter Chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script. As Lucien, Jean - Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotional. Even his clever denouement has you guessing. Hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending. Only the French are capable of such tantalisation. To give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair. All credit to writer / director Gilles Mimouni who fashioned this winding, twisting tale of deceit and betrayal.",1
"It also deserves some deeper thinking : how much is real in a game of relationship? < br / > < br / > This is a very fast - paced, delicately crafted and seductively witty story with an enticing execution by cast.",1
was it BBC? !,1
"This is one of the most brilliant French films ever made. The film is ultimately'made'by Romane Bohringer. I will doubtless see it many more times. Although the film is mysterious, even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director, Gilles Mimouni.",1
There is also another character called Alice who is involved in the whole confusion. There are many layers to this movie. Thus he tries to find Lisa. The ending lends a cynical touch. Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting movies that I have ever seen.,1
"Love is passion, which is derivative from the Latin "" pain "". Huge search here! ), devil (? ) You can suffer a lot when you are in love! A lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written! < br / > < br / > Ah, the story! So, Such a presence and such voices, even for a hard - of - hearing! It'look like Gotham City, modern and old at the same time!",1
"Come on! The director has left more than enough clues in all scenes. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. < br / > < br / > Acting is simply great. The only one who did was Alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut. < br / > < br / > Many European movies use a story telling technique I fully enjoy. Max did not know, that Lisa had left and why. And she is right, of course. This one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details.",1
This film is one of them.,1
Watch it more than once.,1
"This is a fabulous film. What was deliberate, and what was coincidence? < br / > < br / > A classic.",1
A godawful American remake has been made! )!,1
"Every time I watch it, it fills me with delight. the world's most perfect woman. Yet when the moment comes, it is handled so delicately, so briefly, so deftly, that on reflection it makes you gasp. < br / > < br / > The acting is great too. This is a story told in light, in colour, in many almost - parallels. Cinema doesn't come much better than this.",1
Not worth creating a VHS version at this point. < br / > < br / > Would fit in very well the mini - series or dramatic history genre. Was 6 - 8 hours total. Insanely well crafted mini - series.,1
And it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot. A slightly more relaxed pace and a less p - faced narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit.,1
"And between Martin Sheen & Sinsise as Tom, I would say Sinise wins. Character - wise : Vincent D'onofrio playing Phil Romano was excellent, better that Paul Sorvino. As for George, I would praise Shalhoub.",1
"It's primarily at the coach's house, however. It's amazing to watch, with energy that just chills you. They proved their worth here.",1
"This movie is based on a play, and is the second adaptation of this work. They have all met for a reunion.",1
< br / > < br / > Highly Recommended. All films which Kevin McKid also star in.,1
"This is a positive story of facing up to life and responsibility that isn't overwhelm by the subject matter. Sound a bit too heavy? It is a character driven, enthralling film with a strong cast and some very good performances.",1
Recommended. We're forced to hate him and latterly sympathise with him. A very worthwhile viewing.,1
"Subtlety, finesse, charm are not easy to find in his films - - melodrama brims in them. He fails in every department as a director except perhaps that he succeeds in getting some above - average performances from his actors. It happened. It is unfortunate that none of those directors had the financial support that Kapur had to give them and their films an international viewership. The film's subject is poignant and very real.",1
"Then they should be asked - How normal do they feel? This movie is violent, powerful and thought provoking. Irrespective of the accuracy of facts, Bandit Queen is a true story, its true because the themes it deals with hold as much truth today as they did way back in 1994.",1
"< br / > < br / > There are some factual ambiguities too. Survived long enough to see her story made into a movie at least. Then the final scene where Phoolan surrenders shows her touching the feet of Chief Minister, while in reality she had surrendered to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. I saw Bandit Queen in 2005, over a decade after it was made amidst widespread controversy in India. The music is apt. But the screenplay is patchy.",1
I would pay a good price for both of these on DVD. That one you can get from your local library.,1
This is a very hilarious short. Green and McIntyre provide great performances here!,1

The storyline is fully consistent with Richard Rhodes'definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer'with Sam Waterston in the title role and with David Suchet as Evard Teller is an example of the docudrama at its very finest.

Well Recommended! Patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt.,1
It came back to me like a dam flooding over. No movie has ever moved me that way before.,1

Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations. It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part. She carries the movie well.,1

When I saw this on TV I was nervous... whats if they messed it up?,1

"The most balanced and successful story is the Franck and Suzie one. The waitress, Suzie ( Anna Mouglalis ) takes pity and tell him her story. The quality of the individual stories varies. Four stories intersect at a French motorway diner. I look forward to seeing more of Writer / director's Samuel Benchetrit'work.",1
Enjoy movies! I watched this mini in the early eighties.,1
"And the last scene is my favorite. Makes me feel so warm and.. romantic. Looks like a part of crew, hehe. But this is not a musical after all. Excellent work by Samuel Benchetrit. It's about characters, their feelings, very subtle.",1

"And I've never read books, so I really don't care about fidelity to Christie's characters. I'll take the gas - pipe. If you want the book as written, then read it. Every line for Hastings is one taken away from Poirot. Theatre is not prose - don't expect a transcription.",1
"It's up to Hercule Poirot to find a killer. But someone is obviously taking Cora seriously. It might be old fashioned, but that's the way I like it. The acting is equally impressive. The mystery is top notch with plenty of clues, suspects, and red herrings.",1
"( * * * ) A must - see for mystery buffs, and just a very good film in general.",1
"As most other reviewers seem to agree, this adaptation of'After The Funeral'is very good indeed. This is really one of the very best of Poirot series so far.",1
It was both entertaining and informative. Absolutely the best thing I have ever seen on TV. Except for height he looked very much like Robert Oppenheimer. It was the first time that I noticed Sam Waterston as an actor.,1
"Other than that, this is an hour and a half of pure televisual delight which is as self indulgent and entertaining as it is lovingly put together.",1
I saw this film on the A & E channel this past weekend.,1
"I was afraid that they would ruin the story, but instead it is very faithful to the book. All in all, a must see, one of the best Poirot episodes by far, and one of the more faithful ones too. Back to After the Funeral, the production values are fantastic. 10 / 10 Bethany Cox After The Funeral was absolutely superb, and by far the best episode of the season.",1
"< br / > < br / > Bravo Suchet, Dolan and the whole team for crafting this masterpiece of murder mystery theatre, and the producers who gave it the green light! Encore!

"Without a doubt the best Poirot movie ever! I was disappointed about the changes made in CARDS ON THE TABLE - - my favourite Poirot book. The movie was nearly page - for - page faithful throughout, right down to the killer'motive! It wasn't! "".",1

I was surprised that I liked this movie.,1
"They more than made up for in the horror & gore & atmosphere for the movie it's self. < br / > < br / > The music in this movie was top notch stuff, ideal horror music so it was. But seriously though if they were a little better it would have been low budget perfection, maybe.",1
"It's not about loud laughs but about long lasting smiles. Instead it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine. Kind of East German version of "" Buffalo Soldiers "". Utopian, of course ( in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality ), but very thoughtful.",1
"I liked it. The ending was quite unrealistic, I'd say, but happy. Showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly.",1

Instead they can only communicate through each other. We judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful.

"He understands something about not touching. Antonioni, in his eighties, had been crippled by a stroke. < br / > < br / > Ted's Evaluation - - 3 of 4 : Worth watching. This is a special film if you know the context. So we have a film : about a director who conjures stories by simple observation. The idea is that he can conjure a story into being by just looking at it.",1
"But this is somehow not enough to make a comprehensive and cohesive film. No doubt, the setting is splendid and the casting is gorgeous. ).",1
"What a strange phenomenon, complex simplicity or the invisible complex which Antonioni's eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate. I saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time ( even in metropolitan movie capital L. A.! ) For example, it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor, something I did not notice at first, but was turned on to by another critic, and noticed to much delight Here's another Antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or DVD.",1
"Some films exist just as visual experiences, this is one of them. Or, to put it another way, an old man.",1
( VERY large explosions. ) A must - see!,1

"These two disappear sharpish when the reporter pokes his nose around, but strange other coincidences start popping up. Then along comes a film like Noroi - The Curse. But the lank haired ghost lady had definitely had her feed at the party, and was time to take that success - drunk tramp home to bed! The film is a documentary about one of Japan's top paranormal investigators as he receives stories and tip offs on ghostly goings on.",1
"but the creepy moments, the genuinely creepy moments, were sadly a bit fewer and farther between than I had hoped. And the finale is a hair - raising doozy.",1
"The question "" That's it? "" Well, it's better left unanswered. Yes, you heard me right : It makes you think. The film is very engrossing and it makes you think. went though my mind. < br / > < br / > Above all, it's a frightening little film. < br / > < br / > And it works.",1
"I, for one, absolutely loved this movie. < br / > < br / > Noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. ).",1
The actors did a good job. It feels like a real documentary film ( even if it's not ). Why?,1
"A second viewing is highly recommended, though. I can't praise this film enough. The horror is more in what is not shown, but left to our imaginations.",1
"NOROI follows a documentary filmmaker, Masafumi Kobayashi, as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil that's leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake.",1
"for a great J - Horror experience. I highly recommend picking it up. This review contains some small, yet significant, spoilers. < br / > < br / > The plot was very interesting and really kept me wondering how everything tied together.",1
"Simply put, Noroi is ( probably ) one of the best horror movies I have ever seen ( and I have seen a lot!

This is intelligent film - making indeed. Anyone familiar with horror films knows that most of them are not scary at all. Some people enjoy gorefests with subpar story lines and character development. Noroi is one of them. It totally wrecked me in a wonderous way.,1
Lots of us saw this series when we were in college or around that time anyway. Has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet? How can this be true and what can we do to change it? Now we want to share it with our children... but we can't?,1

"Provided you can find this rare gem. To top that, here comes Monsters! I guarantee, because I'm 23 : ).",1
MONSTERS is neither lame nor spectacular but it is entertaining.,1
"Great show, just great, regardless of what the other reviewers have said here. It definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was, "" Tales From The Crypt. My favorite episode was called "" Bug House "", yeah that was the title I think? This was one of the best half - hour horror / suspense / fantasy shows of the eighties, without a doubt.",1
"! I mean, come on! I also loved the opening intro with the monster family.",1
"The cast is comprised of B actors but they are all good, especially Lon Chaney as the Indian chief. The dialogue is rather trite but the scenery lends itself to the realism of Kentucky backwoods.",1
I was enchanted by Niami's debut. See it. And I thought the complex inter - threaded plots were just right.,1
Even Sandra Bernhard is funny here!,1
"I put this film in the queue on a whim after a recent trip to NYC, and I couldn't believe I'd never heard of it anywhere! Highly recommended! It has all the makings of a cult classic, starting with the characters.",1
The acting is great.,1
"This hilarious farce, I believe, is in the tradition of a Mel Brooks comedy. The director, Ramin Niami, delivers the goods with Somewhere in the City.",1
"However, there id seem to be a fairly decent plot, if unoriginal. I agree with the Aussie's comments for the most part. So the question is, "" How far will James go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed? "" < br / > < br / > Watch for Devinn Lane here and in "" Beauty Betrayed. "" She seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the "" R "" world.",1

"One of Keli McCarthy's best. It has gorgeous, sexy women and some sexy settings. Nice! My favorite from 2001. This movie is filled with sex, and nudity. I had a blast with it.",1
"Predictable, but nice, sweet nature and romantic. So was the story. I'd love to know. This was a very nice soft - core movie for both men and women. Plenty of nudity / sex, but without the overall raunch you'll usually find. I give this 7 / 10!",1
"The story was riveting, suspenseful and engaging.",1
The ending would have killed movie. = ( it made me cry! but the romance between them. because i sure was.,1
"There were two many storylines for the series or this film. I thought the chemistry between Poitier's character and that of the orphan Whitewolf very moving and thought Wirth and Poitier worked very well together. I also enjoyed the Billy Wirth / Joanna Going storyline, they seems to play off each other well. Billy Wirth did some of his best scenes when working with Poitier. But on the whole it was a great evening of entertainment. Worked for me also.",1
High recommended.,1
Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand him at all. Could anyone get away with such a fraud even then? Morgan and Stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married.,1

"people are just selfish. third, it was nice to see a fat guy who had some self - confidence.",1
I love this movie!!! ha ha ha...,1
"If you ask me it does not get the credit it deserves. The ending is sad, but that is how life is. I think everyone should see it. I saw this movie for the first time just a short while ago.",1
"anyone who hasn't seen it, go rent it. really good album for the movie.",1
"It is a little piece of 80s American and worth having in your movie collection. I don't think I will include any spoilers but If I do, I can cover my butt. """,1
"The baby swallowed the watch "" was always my son's favorite line. Dennis Morgan has a few great songs, too. While it's not "" perfect "", it's close. I can go on and on.",1
I was a horny teenager in the 80 '. Why?,1
Or you can just pay attention to boys'quest to de - virginize themselves! They are just moments ; not the entire film. I really like this movie.,1
Sensational soundtrack.,1
"U2 "" I will follow "" - Jesus is it that old? Nice guys finish last!! < br / > < br / > Great sound track too!! ?",1
but his other friend is pretty cool. second only to the breakfast club. i have the movie. it's a very honest movie. it's also very 80ish which i love. that are very funny. you can feel it even more in the second half. he also cheats on side. i love it! the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy. in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time.,1
"An incredible film that subverts all of the expectations of genre. The eighties version of Detective Story. I'm amazed it ever got made. If it was made today, it'd be considered an art house movie.",1
"! Secretly, Gary lusts after Karen, who is involved with Rick, his best friend. Also, it has one of the rockingest soundtracks ever made!! American Pie this is not. It is tender tale of envy and unrequited love set in the early eighties.",1
I liked it because it ends the way things really do.,1
"Ahhh... the'80's. < br / > < br / > The movie follows three hormonal friends. And, you know what? It wasn't far - fetched. I bought it. But, who is Karen dancing with by film end... Rick. Oscar worthy?",1
That formula is tossed aside after guy meets girl. It is funny and sad at the same time.,1
!,1
"Yes, this film is silly and exploitive but it is funny and sexy. Moritz was always a popular "" B "" level actress and Gary drives off without the girl! She tells him that she's pregnant and that Rick has dumped her. A few days later in the school library Gary see's Rick and Karen arguing and he asks Karen what is wrong.",1
"First - time viewers will not be prepared for it and it will be a shock. Check out early, early U2 (! < br / > < br / > Some of the comedy parts are really funny. The reaction when her sailor husband comes home is a riot. < br / > < br / > Underrated soundtrack too.",1
"Humor ( not unlike that of "" Fast times "" ), Drama, and a GREAT GREAT soundtrack. < br / > < br / > Great, knee slappping humor. Definitely a lot of surprises. This is one of the best and most under rated teen movies ever made. ( who could forget the scene between Gary and Camilla? ).",1
"Rick is no villain, and constantly through film he reminds Gary and Dave that they're his best friends. Rick turns out to be a cad, but you have to bear in mind that his character is only 17 years old. For the shy romantic Gary, when he sees the lovely Karen for the first time he falls instantly in love. He panics and makes a bad decision. Yet, Karen, in the end, is not moved by Gary's devotion and kindness. As in real life, you don't bow out because your friend has an unrequited love. From Rick's perspective, the story is also about finding the one girl of his dreams, a bad breakup, and then at the end reconciling. Lawrence Monoson is a beautiful loser. Spoilers in this review! He does everything right, his heart's in the right place, and he's consumed by love for Karen.",1
But now it is available! But then the ending came and we just sat there completely speechless.,1
"And that is part of the attraction. It is funny and it shows antics of highschoolers quite well. True. No highschool film has ever done this better. But having said all that, the movie is fun. And that is, "" Nice guys finish last "".",1
"That's not what I got. I saw this in a theatre back in 1982. I expected a stupid T & A movie. Then the jokes stop and things get very dark. < br / > < br / > Yeah, they're stupid but I enjoyed them anyways. Also it has GREAT soundtrack.",1
< br / > < br / > Well done.,1
"Not to be missed. < br / > < br / > Jim The Feast is still solemn, but humorous.",1
"He should suspect something instantly, but doesn It's not Goulash, It's Irish Stew "". I don't flip. "". I scoop!",1
There is no need for me to repeat the synopsis rendered by Glenn.,1
This film offers many delights and surprises. The speech had such a minimal impact that I hardly remember it. < br / > < br / > Babette is an artist whose medium is food.,1
Their choice leaves them alone until a French woman comes.,1
So what are you waiting for? Go watch it..... again! It is also a powerful symbol and a medium for culture itself.,1
! Highly recommended! But this one really is in its own league.,1
< br / > < br / > Superb photography. It has started quietly. You feel the rhythm of that ancient village's life. Stroke after stroke on the scene canvas. All characters are slowly depicted on the scene.,1
It was truly a feast. Even the film is a metaphor. I see the story of God in here.,1
"< br / > < br / > What do we experience? The sisters made their sacrifices to duty and faith. Even though Babette over time has made improvements, what they are seeing now seems close to godlessness. The sisters do what they can. There is the austerity of the aging community's faith and the stone, wind - swept cottages they live in.",1
"She moves to a very religious Danish village. This is one movie that you can't afford to miss. < br / > < br / > One more thing. Babette's Feast "" is the same type of thing.",1
"A Christmas Classic, it's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s. The only weak point is the leading man, Dennis Morgan.",1
"The French Babbette appears at the modest house of two Danish sisters wet, cold, and alone. Babette gives herself to her adopted community through thrift, productivity, and shared faith. She leaves only when she wins the French lottery - - 10, 000 francs.",1
They live on salt cod and black bread gruel. < br / > < br / > Babette cooks up a bang - up French dinner to celebrate the 100th birthday of the late reverend.,1
"Impossible to improve or ignore. CHOICES is a central theme, as well as grace.",1
"The photography is wondrously well executed. Match all this with a film score that is almost minimalist in character and also perfectly conceived, and you'll "" get "" this movie. A gentle story, hinting at fury, with a redemptive message and glorious celebration.",1
"I tried to watch, on the DVD, in English to overcome this problem ( don't make this mistake the result is a travesty ). < br / > < br / > I laugh out loud and cry each time I watch this film France!. An acting master class - not in the dialogue but body language.",1
"They are now old and their life and beauty spent. < br / > < br / > When Babette wins the lottery, she requests a chance to prepare a feast - a true labour of love. The life in the village is simple and the stark direction reflects that. Possibly the best international film of the 1980 '.",1
"A good lottery prize lets her organize a great banquet, following the best rules of French gastronomy. This movie is almost unknown, but it is very good. However, the seductive force of the delicious meal they eat, that they become seduced by the sensuality of French gastronomy. All neighbourhoods are invited ( all fanatically puritans ). The love between humans has awaken. If you happen to like good meals and just love the good gastronomy, probably, you'll feel amused, as most feelings of the movie will be familiar to you. An Oscar totally deserved.",1
"There are meditations here on memory, fate, old age and faithfulness.",1
"Indeed, she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them. She spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist. They were just like Babette : they were desperate to get every dollar necessary to do their very best work.",1
"< br / > < br / > The meal - Babette's feast - was amazing. < br / > < br / > In any case, it's a fine film, but don't watch this if you'dieting. I'm no chef, but I was impressed! If the latter, how you look at the definition of "" legalism "" can affect how you interpret this story.",1
To see her prepare with love and affection her meal is a feast for the eyes. This movie came aside as a shock in the eighties.,1
"Jutland ( where it's set ) is not Africa ; the chill mist that collects on the camera shots is not inviting. The craggiest is Bodil Kjer's as Philippa ; amid the myriad merits of this movie, the most memorable is that face. < br / > < br / > What But as the titles rolled, it became clear that this was no ordinary movie.",1
"A profoundly uplifting film. One day, a French woman, Babette, comes to work for them.",1
"On this viewing tears flowed freely. Their yearnings, desires, sacrifices resonant long after the movie has ended. Sublime - - perfect - - profound - - a true lesson on the idealized meaning of life.",1
"< br / > < br / > One day, however, Babette receives a letter : she has won a lottery and is now, by village standards, a wealthy woman. < br / > < br / > The story is quite simple. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France, the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation.",1
"! The aging congregation has become testy and quarrelsome, and the sisters don't know what to do. Enter Babette, a French stranger, and someone to whom they can show kindness.",1
"Look for good copy. Our hero, the earnest but bland Giuliano Gemma, aims to unravel the conspiracy. Corrupt officials have carried out the murder and have a humble slave take the rap.",1
"Tonino Valerii's "" Il Prezzo Del Potere "" aka. "" The Price Of Power "" is an excellent and enthralling Spaghetti Western that mirrors the Kennedy assassination.",1
"It also has some biting commentary on American politics. This is not to say that there is no action in the movie. Giuliano Gemma and the rest of the cast are superb. There is plenty, and it is very well crafted.",1
"Tonino Valeri directed this fascinating, if flawed film which obviously is an allegory for the Kennedy assassination. Worth a look! Nonetheless this is definitely one of the more interesting and worthwhile spaghetti westerns.",1
Absolutely FANTASTIC score by Luis Bacalov. A spaghetti must have. Gemma is excellent in this.,1
"At first I heard this was a real "" Hollywood "" movie. However, that did not diminish my enjoyment of the movie. So the beginning was a bit confusing for me.",1
< br / > < br / > The final scene had me on the edge of my seat.,1
"They can only be read by the intended recipient. Are Karen and Vasilikov falling in love? < br / > < br / > But what'this? < br / > < br / > Enigma is in the computer in the office of Dimitri Vasilikov. The romantic twist lifts this spy thriller, already worthy of a ten, even higher, for its originality. They don't expect Holbeck to succeed.",1
I thought this to be a pretty good example of a better soft core erotica film.,1
The plot seems similar to me but the roles are reversed. Does anyone know where I can get a hold of it? Not too hard. I feel it is worth seeing again.,1
"However, it just seems like I've seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storyline. Overall : B - Yes, it's hard to understand what she's saying at times, but I think I've placed it. She enjoyed her three - way WAY too much. I think she's from Germany, hence her odd - sounding accent.",1
I think best is yet to come.,1
"For example, the cinematography makes it look like a hard core porno movie. Chole Nicholle delivers the best performance of the female cast. There's absolutely no effort in lightning.",1
"A generous 7 outta 10. At least story - wise anyways. Though the black head doctor, delivers his lines really well. said to her. I love all things related to aliens and this story definitely delivered some good ideas. < br / > < br / > Unfortunately the movie overall is pretty average.

"The aliens are after her. Act One is perfect. It makes sense. I must say the score is great! Someone "" may hurt her. Now back to the film. < br / > < br / > There are three acts to this movie. Act Two ruins the film when the aliens show up. """,1

It's still unclear when BBC - America can broadcast this film. The film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book. Despite that, the film actually did a good job in representing the story. That's pity. It really worth watching.",1
"The centerpiece is a plot to steal fortune that Maud is due on her 21st birthday. I No doubt we'll see more of her. The turns and twists in the plot add tension, though not much credibility, to the movie. They are very unusual in a period drama. I had no idea what I was about to see.",1

This movie was incredible!!! ! A very worthwhile watch.,1
This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth. It is always difficult to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hours film.,1

"He stole the movie if you ask me. Haggard does not take itself seriously AT all, and that was never the purpose. I've seen movie 6 - 7 times and still find new things every time. The soundtrack is just as good. Its a Bam movie people, its not going to be normal.",1

It'not boring but there are times when I wished it would end. I think it's an excellent film but I did not enjoy watching it.,1
"The key to the characters of both mother and daughter is'obsession. < br / > < br / > The film ties itself to the female lead. The camera work also suits the film. Isabelle Huppert amazes with a brutal, completely convincing performance as the piano teacher. But, be brave - have the guts to go and see it.",1
"Huppert's character gets what she asks for in the course of the film, and it is hardly the emancipating experience she had imagined it to be. This is what led me to get the DVD for La Pianiste, which I just finished watching about a half hour ago. At the end of my review of Cache, I wrote that I was intrigued with Haneke as a film maker.",1
"He basically tells Stanwyck that she will entertain Morgan and himself at her farm for the holidays. This is Jefferson Jones ( Dennis Morgan ), sailor. Stanwyck can't.",1
"First of all, those who are faint at heart should definitely avoid this film. Next to the razor blade scene, that disturbed me most. Then why the hateful attitude towards everyone? < br / > < br / > The acting is terrific and I liked the glossy, stylized lighting. The student's mother is not much more sympathetic than she. Why does she receive sexual pleasure from pain?",1
"Isabelle Huppert is stunning in this film - - combined with Haneke, these two never pull their punches. While grounded in reality, much of what Erika ( Huppert ) does can be viewed as emotional metaphor.",1
"Second time, all pieces of puzzle came to the right places. Three actors gave outstanding performances. Franz Schubert's Piano music, "" soaked in the morbid humanity "", is another bright star of the movie. Time went on but I could not get the movie and its main character, Erika Kahut out of my mind. Erika of the book would never chase Walter to throw herself to him. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. < br / > < br / > I only have one problem with Haneke's vision. Not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as "" Le Pianiste "".",1
"Erika flees horrified she's been discovered. Walter decides to audition for Erika's master class, and is accepted. Walter gets turned off by letter Erika has written to him, detailing sexual acts that are repugnant to the young man. Erika is transfixed as she watches the things that are being performed on the screen. His eagerness to compliment Erika is met with skepticism on her part.",1

"Isabelle and Annie play characters we've never seen before on the screen. La Pianiste "" truly confirms it. Isabelle Huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. """,1
"La Pianiste reinforces the "" Austrians = grim "" thesis I'm formulating. I saw this film at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival.",1
"Haneke The novel also includes long passages about Kohut'childhood and adolescence so you kind of understand how she turned into who she is now.

"Basically, there is no way to fault this film's end product. As a piece of art though, it is magnificent. < br / > < br / > Set aboard the Battleship Potempkin, the crew are unhappy. Now though, after the rotten food, enough is enough. Eighty years after the films release though, and the USSR has disappeared completely off the map. < br / > < br / > It's impossible to know how the Russian people received this film upon it's release.",1
Much of the film demonstrates the communist party message and how film was used as a tool of propaganda. The photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the time period.,1
It was surprising that a silent film could be so easy to watch.,1
I attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores. Come on! Your education is incomplete without it. Eisenstein was a master of composition. You owe it to yourself to watch this film!,1
"What follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. Things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of business. < br / > < br / > If you don't like silent films..... watch "" Bronenosets Potyomkin "" anyway.",1
It's a must see classic. 5 / 5.,1

And her publisher Sidney Greenstreet likes the idea so well that he invites himself to the dinner.",1
"Eisenstein emphasizes the sailors'dehumanization with shots of arbitrary lashings, harsh labor, and - most memorably - the maggot infested meat intended for the evening's meal. Onboard ship we witness crowded, unsanitary conditions. Ironically the film's director, Sergei Eisenstein, was one of the earliest and most influential advocates of a formalistic approach to film art.",1
One of best silent films I have ever seen.,1
A 10 / 10. Certainly any film history class should show this movie.,1
"An uprising takes place during which the revolutionary leader is killed. The film is broken into five parts : Men and Maggots, Drama on the Quarterdeck, An Appeal from the Dead, The Odessa Steps, and Meeting the Squadron. When the townspeople gather on a huge flight of steps overlooking the harbor, czarist troops appear and march down the steps breaking up the crowd. But in Potemkin, no one individual is cast as a hero or heroine. Deeds Goes to Town and Meet John Doe.",1
"And today, it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema it always has been. For each new pair of eyes that look upon it,'The Battleship Potemkin'comes alive once again. < br / > < br / >'Potyomkin'is a film that NEEDS to be seen as one entity, not to be picked at.",1
The direction of < br / > < br / > Eisenstein is truly a sight. < br / > < br / > A + Battleship Potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece.,1
"You should see it, buy it, and tatoo it to your chest. Quite a lot has been said about this film and its landmark importance in forming the language of film.",1
"< br / > < br / > Of course, one could go on for books ( which have been written hundreds of times over, not the least of which by Eisenstein himself ).

"No one foresaw the digital microprocessor age! The landing on the "" doppelganger "" earth is both exciting and eerie. And with a nice, 1960s / early'70s style nihilistic ending!

The last fight was also very impressive. This movie is surprisingly good.,1
"One of the true delights of this film, however, is Sidney Greenstreet. Even with the deceptions being played out around him, he's the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet, and in the end it's Elizabeth you really feel for.

"Um, no. At any rate, you use the footage you can. Yes Americans made it.",1
"Unlike the previous poster, I liked the celluloid treatment.",1
You can't help not liking and rooting for Anderson Sa to succeed. The film then continues and you are gripped in your seat until the end. The footage is graphic and shocking.,1
"The pace is as lively as the music. There are talking heads mainly Sa and his closest associate, Jose Junior - but they are presented with imaginative cinematic brilliance. The editing nicely mixes footage of differing themes, punctuated only occasionally by few fact - filled still texts. The only requirement for kids to belong is no smoking, no drinking, no drugs.",1

< br / > < br / > Dustin Hoffman absolutely shines as Ted Kramer. But there's not much else to complain about here.,1
"Hoffman is at the top of his form here. Jane Alexander also got an Oscar nod as Ted and Joanna's neighbor, Margaret, who has switched allegiances by the film's conclusion. KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars, including Best Picture of 1979. Robert Benton's incisive screenplay presents us flawed, but real human beings with hearts, souls, and brains.",1
The'crafting'of this movie certainly emanates from a place deep within someone'heart and mind. This is a phenomenal movie.,1
It appeared as a very kind film to me. Kramer versus Kramer shows the destruction of a family structure. Luckily nothing happened to Nestor.,1
"In fact, I agree with the other reviewer that it gives us unprecedented access. ( Yikes! No Mondovi's in Italy may not translate as well elsewhere. The dogs are family, the workers are family. First, I loved the documentary. < br / > < br / > I'll get the camera and dogs out of the way first. It is a remarkable bait and switch.",1
"She sure can deliver when she is on, though.",1
"They grow together, come to know each other and form entirely new and wonderful relationship. He keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, while delivering all the drama straight from the heart. Also nominated was Jane Alexander for her fantastic turn as the Kramer's good friend Margaret.",1
"And as for the breakfast scene with Billy ( Justin Henry ), just simply magnificent. Around 7½ out of 10.",1
It did however affect his performance as a father. Then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than Joanna! Ted was distraught. And that He blew up when Billy spilled punch on his client artwork! He had a great job and a loving wife. They met in a corner café.,1
Good drama movie about a child custody case with great performances by all the actors.,1

"Put simply, a perfect film. It has such excellent narrative drive. < br / > < br / > 10 / 10.",1
I think that this is what what made the film good. It dealt with a serious situation but didn't take itself too seriously.,1
"< br That's not escapism - - the number one reason the average person turns to movies - - that's sad reality. Streep does so effortlessly. Writer / director Robert Benton definitely achieves both and in impressive fashion in adapting this novel by Avery Corman. Hoffman is in his prime in this role : his first Oscar win after three other notable nominations. Kramer vs. Kramer "" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so troubling.",1
"SM This is unusual in France - laughing aloud. the one from a communist village in Languedoc. Polite, patient, genial. He got a lot of laughs. There is no question which side of terror - globalization war they are on!",1
"Honestly I'm not enthralled watching old movies, but then in the long run it changes my point of view. The story was strongly emotional, but is not saturated with such.",1
< br / > < br / > The custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance. He's the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity.,1
This movie is also revealing. The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.,1
"Hoffman's a career oriented man in the advertising game. Kramer vs. Kramer is the story of a marital breakup and the consequences of same. She also wants out of being a mother, at least for a while. At that point after over a year, Streep decides she wants custody.",1
"a neighbor tells us ) ; the busy, distracted husband takes on the "" motherly "" responsibilities and grows closer to his son, but soon the wife returns. Streep's character is designed to be a cold, self - centered witch, but I was ready to feel a lot more for her than Benton probably wanted.",1
"There is nothing wrong with the film. Yet, it has fine humor as well. The actors's chemistry is just perfect. A timeless classic. No, this has nothing to do with the sitcom "" Seinfeld "" or its eccentric and hilarious character Cosmo Kramer. Meryl Streep is great as Ted's wife, Joanna.",1
"Thank god I was alone! So Dustin Hoffman passes the test with flying colors, in my opinion. Wow, that's all I can say. I tried but I couldn't. This is probably the purest film I have ever seen. I think not! Other films that were nominated for Best Picture was Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz.",1
"Yes, it'dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. Kramer vs. Kramer "" was great to me because I think I could relate to it. 5.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film is tear - jerky at the finale, but not in a manipulative way. The movie doesn't present Hoffman's solid dad as a hero or Streep's straying mom as a villain. It earns its right to elicit sobs.",1
"I highly recommend it. Certainly, one of Hoffman's best films he's ever done.",1
what is means many times wine filtered of it's origin. as we all know power corrupts. mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. in the world of wine there is a huge different between the big winery and the small one. also in business world of today wine often has to mass marketed and suited to people's taste. now these men are not evil or wrong for they have done a great deal of good for wine.,1
It touched both the emotions and the intellect.,1
See it for yourself and you will definitely not be disappointed.,1
"He's also funny at times. He was great in that film, but I disagree that its his best. Kramer vs. Kramer "" is a great film from start to finish.",1
"Yours Sincerely, Ian PS. Hi! Take care and hope your admiration for Jackie grows! You know the police chief in A II?",1
This encouraged him to work on his next film close to home.,1
But not enough fighting for top rating. Really exciting stuff! But sadly I was a little disappointed. Jackie Chan and his stunt team don't disappoint here at all.,1
Watch your PBS listing!,1
< br / > < br / > However it does outdo Michael Moore at the game Moore can't play anyway. It's an open show that doesn't lead conclusion. It's not really about wine.,1
"The racial stereotyping is done from the view of humor & not hate. Stewarts is more famous & has a stronger message. Then when he gets elected, he surprises them. < br / > < br / > At least we have this one. This film is more clever & subtle which are Harold Lloyds trademarks.",1
"The old telephones are enchanting. They are the wise, good and friendly guys.",1
"As it turns out Lin Po turns out to be one wise dude. Deeds and Mr. Smith. In addition Lloyd gains the admiration of Una Merkel, as cynical a dame as Jean Arthur was in Mr. But no sooner does Lloyd arrive and pastor dies. They decide Lloyd just might be a better patsy than the guy who just died.",1
"Early on, he meets man who turns out to be a local party boss. Lloyd does not do the old familiar stunt work, the romance is quite unlike his early screen romances, and the plot is just plain weird! < br / > < br / > An important note : This movie is definitely NOT politically correct. ! Well, the unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins!! So, my advice is at the end, just suspend disbelief and enjoy. This movie caught me by surprise. The word "" Chink "" is used repeatedly.",1
"( Especially at the end of the film ). ( But, this is just MY opinion ).",1
"< br / > < br / > The first sound movies were often disasters. What is often neglected about Harold Lloyd is that he was an actor. He didn't have a bad voice ; its high pitch suited his "" glasses "" character. He came to Hollywood to act ; and he discovered he had a knack for acting funny - - first in shorts, then in features.",1
"Or is it? < br / > < br / > He produced his own films, but unlike Chaplin he did not own his own studio. Lloyd tried the route that Chaplin took, but with less success. When a movie is made dictates what it's politics are : "" The Cat's Paw "" is from 1934. These three ( and possibly "" The Sin of Harold Diddlebock "" ) were his best sound ventures.",1
< br / > < br / > This movie was a bit of a departure from Harold Lloyd's previous movies.,1
! This is best film of the year so far!!,1
"( this and a few low - cut dress scenes is the only exploitation of Ms. Lane. Still, these are minor shortcomings. This is in the book but not the movie. he dreams of joining his Anthropologist father studying a fierce tribe in South America. She miraculously cleans up instantly. Liz has boyfriends and does coke. Finn however does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends.",1
< br / > < br / > High recommended. A very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine. Just saw this movie 2 days ago.,1
"Incidents occur to alter feelings and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked assailant, a turning point for the film and Finn'view of the Osborne family. But as the story develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear.",1
Kristen Stewart is good as pretty grand daughter. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. High quality movie. I really enjoyed Fierce People. They are used to getting their own way.,1
"Wake up, studio execs!",1
"I was lucky enough to see this at this years Tribeca film festival. Early days I know, but Lane acts her socks off here.",1
I guess it is a drama. I liked it. Someone said it was'sick'so they couldn't watch it. I think you will too!,1
"It played several festivals that year. And what a treasure it was. And, perhaps, that's why it's been "" lost. "" It defies categorization. Vanished. Poof. So let's call it a hybrid. Then this screening was announced.",1
But the end of the film is great to watch but hogwash. What were they thinking?! The film is entertaining and the fighting is excellent. There are no complaints about the action or acting.,1
A must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry.,1
Possibly it the very realistic depictions of martial arts. Chiba seems so exhausted at one point that it hurts to watch. < br / > < br / > That Oyama could kill a bull with his bare hands is true. He was called on to repeat this feat numerous times. How much of the film is true is questionable. I always wondered why it's not more well known. Sonny Chiba portrays his master with conviction and the karate is quite good. In the middle of this is the legendary bullfight with a mad bull.,1
"Sonny Chiba, as everyone knows, is the man.",1
"He speaks and it doesn't speak back. The corporate boys congratulated him on the performance. He preferred his own prison instead of the world on the outside. When it comes to movies, I don't easily discriminate between crap, pure crap and masterpieces. Oliver Stone is a minor master of the moody. Bogosian probably nailed one of the toughest single - man performances in modern cinema. This man is confined to his own volition and he can never escape it. For me, it was the passion that Eric Bogosian put into his performance.",1
I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of human nature. < br / > < br / > A film not easily forgotten.,1
You have to see it to believe it. < br / > < br / > Alec Baldwin also shines as Barry's boss.,1
Eric Bogosian gives as great a performance as you'll ever see in an Oliver Stone film. < br / > < br / > Listen if you dare!,1
"But Nossiter managed to give his movie a consistency all along. I give this documentary 10 out of 10, despite his technical particularities. I was expecting a lot from this movie, and I can say I haven't been disappointed. You may not like it, but I don't consider it as a defect. First of all, this movie, as a world tour of wine making, let the spectator enjoy beautiful places.",1
"Rather, the shots of the buildings act as an anchor around which the study is observed. < br / > < br / > Talk Radio begins with a montage of tall, towering buildings in a business based area of Dallas, Texas.",1
creepy.,1
Good performances by Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin also help. And things may be heating up more than anyone realizes. I really liked the scene where he jab at a redneck who calls in.,1
"At times you just want to strangle the host, Barry. This movie really draws you in.",1
"Watching it, I was mesmerized.",1
This movie is filled with a man talking about showing you a more complex character than has been seen in many movies. ).,1
"The support cast are great, particularly Greene as the ex - wife and Baldwin as the boss. Bogosian's hawkish features burn into the frame, with his green eyes constantly darting around as if permanently seeking an answer to some riddle. < br / > < br / > This is an intense, provocative character piece about a man with almost no redeeming features who at the same time seems to be onto some really profound philosophy. Is Barry a media messiah in search of truth, or a social misfit out to assault his audience?",1
"But still I think it fits okay. The dark music in the background fits very nicely too. So after the film was over I was speechless. Then I went to another store about a month later and I found "" Talk Radio "" on DVD for only $ 5. 00. I have never seen such a film like this. Alright, the first time I seen "" Talk Radio "" was in a video store for only $ 2.",1
"Stone has nothing to be ashamed of, most directors would kill to get a shot @ a film like this. In my opinion the film is about freedom of speech and how sometimes people don't like hearing things they don't agree with.",1
Know what you're getting into before you sit down to watch it and you'll be fine.,1
Controlled branded taste is easier. Profit vs. art.,1
"Though this is what has made him a popular radio show host, it has also earned him numerous enemies. Never having seen an Oliver Stone film before, nor any films starring Eric Bogosian, I didn't know what to expect from this film. Eric Bogosian is brilliant as Barry Champlain, the troubled talk radio host with Alec Baldwin turning in a strong performance as Barry's boss, Dan. < br / > < br / > The acting in this film was hugely impressive with not one dud actor in it. Having toyed with the idea of buying it for a while, I finally got it for free as a supplement with a Sunday newspaper and I was hugely impressed.",1
"Oliver Stone is not one to shy away from a movie or theme for that matter. Look on his CV for proof! Now I might be reading too much into it, but I don't believe that.",1
"The film shows the rise and fall of the man's career, carefully making an accurate portrayal on freedom of speech. It remains even more poignant today than it was in the late'80s. Talk Radio is an unsettling and amusing attack on what is now known as "" reality TV "". The film asks the question of "" is our main protagonist just the same as the sad people who call up the show? """,1
"But overall, the film works.",1
"The Stewart Copeland score is brilliant, too. "" Stone and Bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity. Alec Baldwin, as his Alpha male boss, strikes the perfect note as a man driven nuts by a guy whose monstrousness he helped nurture. The film is a flawless, underrated masterpiece of superb writing, awesome acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. Ellen Greene is fantastic as Barry's sweet ex - wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal vitriol.",1
Just the story of Alan Green? Maybe he had more grip than the listeners though. I don't think so.,1
The 1988 movie was prophetic enough to recognize the underground movement that was developing in the farm and hinterland of America. Barry get's his high rating by his razor sharp wit and abusive behavior when he's on the air. One of them decides to take matters into his on hand at Barry's expense.,1
"But in the 80's he had this energy and feverish quality to the look of the film, and wasn't as frenzied as other films. Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of those pundits you hear on the radio stations many of us might turn off.",1
"It's a pretty small movie, actually. Talk Radio usually doesn't. I sure was. < br / > < br / > See Talk Radio, even if you don't like Oliver Stone movies.",1
< br / > < br / > The setting for this movie is perfect in that there is a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology.. ! This high profile cannon fodder is something that Barry Champlain thrives on!!!,1
We do indeed all need a little disorder - bravo Hubert! James McNally's summary of the content of the film is very good.,1
"Gender roles and self - denial can both do this. Why? Easily one of the best Indian films ever. Sita, for example, is the wife of the revered Lord Ram. < br / > < br / > Beautiful because of its imagery. In other words, that is its strength, NOT its weakness.",1
This film is just good old fashion acting.,1
No need to dwell on the authenticity of the wigs. This is powerful cinema. Danton would surely have agreed?,1
"Robespierre in this fine epic kills the opposition by remote control, all in a fit of self - righteous devotion to his principles.",1
Walensa. totalitarian leaders.,1
"imdb. For example Robespierre & Desmoulins were close friends since their youth, and this explains how Robespierre acts. Unlike http : / / www.",1
"< br / > < br / > Overall, I was disappointed with this much - lauded film. Great cast, great director, but no quality foundation. Bad undynamic script. And yet, the direction was masterful... it's Wajda, afterall! ! Depardieu comes off as a quasi - goofy, nonchalant Danton... not exactly the image we have in mind.",1
"It's made with passion and eye for detail. < br / > < br / > Somehow it doesn't make the movie any less great to watch though. every aspect about the movie is good looking, such as its settings, costumes and camera - work.",1
The flick will like to historical cinema buffs.,1
"As others have commented, it might have been more logical to It may be historically accurate, but it's not entirely satisfying as the outcome of a screen scenario - - it seems an odd place to stop. < br / > < br / > Considered as a film, it's not entirely satisfactory in that it ebbs away towards the end.",1
The costumes are spot on. Must see....,1
"I love wine and I love hearing about the controversies raging in my business. When it was shown in Cannes, it was close to three hours long. There are many many more fascinating personalities in this documentary. There is Robert Parker himself, expressing some discomfort with his influence while refusing to stop writing about wines that he favours. Now, for me, that's fine.",1
"So, as a result of being silenced this way, Danton et al begin publicly criticizing the government. So much for "" liberty, equality and fraternity ""! However, not showing a connection between Danton's death and the fall of the government is an odd thing to omit. Danton was a hero and one of the founders of the French Revolution of 1789. However, I really wish the ending had been handled differently. This movie is set five years later and the revolution has morphed into something ugly. This would have been a dandy little epilogue and could have been done in about five minutes.",1
Everyone should see great film.,1
"Danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to curb the bloodletting. His Polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the Solidarity trade union, which had opposed the Polish government in the late seventies and early eighties. This was the first French language film made by Andrzej Wajda after he had arrived in France from Poland.",1
It is probable the historical part may be not as probable as the rest.,1
Yep. Frederic is a novelist - in - expectation.,1
"Yet Bon Voyage is not a "" war movie. """,1
"This is a clever, original, suspenseful and funny film. ( "" Boy, that should have them rolling in the aisles "" ) But it does! Both are impressive, but Mr. Derangère is especially so.",1
"Adjani and Depardieu are simply excellent in their roles. The film is supposed to entertain, and it does! The plot is simple.",1
"The DVD box describes this film as a comedy. First, a word of caution. The acting, writing and direction were excellent. Together, they create a nice package this is sure to please.",1
a very good entertaining movie.,1
He's perfect in this film. Stning. Such innocence and grace!,1
"One comment said it wasn't a comedy... An enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours in a theater. Often the shots out the window of the train, or car, were just beautiful. Mistake! Very busy... and active film from beginning to end.",1
A spy comedy? But the main problem with this movie is about the script. 5 / 10 Without big turns in the plot. < br / > < br / > My rate : 6.,1
"It's exciting, funny, and, ultimately, touching. N. B. Costumes and make - up were accurate. It was better than that.",1
This is a film that you will not regret watching.,1
Good advice. What beauty!!,1
"Recommend it to cinemaphile friends. Though not yet as widely influential as Renoir's'Rules of the Game,'' Bon Voyage'richly deserves to be a companion piece to that classic. It was a time, he says, when "" all the adults were a little bit insane. """,1
"It would seem a given, but if a viewer forgets context, he risks missing an opportunity of enjoyment. < br / > < br / > Gloria was cute.",1
"My vote is nine. < br / > < br / > What a delightful and magnificent romantic adventure "" Bon Voyage "" is! Frédéric hits the car, the dead man is found and he is sent to prison.",1
"It's wartime drama - WWII, with French and Jews and Germans, but this one is somehow fun, earnestly so. Director Jean - Paul Rappeneau co - wrote the script to his well - received film "" Bon Voyage "" ( 2003 ).",1
Brilliant.,1
I guess that was how child serials like giant Robot got appreciated.,1
My email is creator67 @ pipinternet.,1
I'm glad I took my friend's advise and tried it. Boy was he wrong. So many people are missing out on flicks like this.,1
"Our main character is an oyster girl named Nan ( short for Nancy ) from Winchester. The story does get a little The execution is a little bit of a problem and director Geoffrey Sax is a bit too gimmicky for my liking. Sarah Waters is obviously an inventive writer, and the film remains interesting for the duration.",1
"Naik was an "" encounter specialist "". We see him trying to adjust to a new "" commissioner "" halfway through the film. Most of the reviews for Ab Tak Chappan have been extremely positive.",1
I wish there could be sequel!,1
Think twice! The cast was beyond expectation! This is a must see series.,1
< br / > < br / > Enjoy! The BBC surpassed themselves with the boundaries they crossed with Tipping the Velvet.,1
"This was one of the most emotional movies I have seen. < br / > < br / > Than to never have loved before? """,1
Kitty was ready to give it all up to get Nancy back. WAKE UP!!! In Kitty's eyes you could see Kitty's pain. And Kitty is not to be the only one to blame. Even though you love a woman.,1
I wish there could be sequel!,1
The rest of the cast are very good.,1
No one who saw this series would ever say she can't act. It's not a rehash of style or plot. This BBC series is astonishingly good fun.,1
"Nevertheless, Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film - making. A new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case.",1
Its nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this society. I love this movie.,1
"Um, kinda like the Anne Heche and Ellen Degeneres thing.",1
"A journey of the mind, body and soul. Emotional! I loved this movie.",1
"We've come a long way, but we still have a long way to travel. Nan expects this too. Both Stirling and Hawes are wonderful, and their acting carries film along.",1
"But if you have heart, and you believe in love, you will cry at the end as much as I did! She falls and falls hard for Kitty Butler, a male impersonator with a visiting theatre troupe.",1
Kitty eventually becomes enveloped in a marriage of convenience and ravages young Nan's heart. I loved the film and the novel. The young girl soon joins the act as another male impersonator and they are a major hit. That's where Nan will discover the power of socialism and learn how to get back to fame. A revolutionary production ; an absolute must - see Soon the both of them embark on a tender affair.,1
This film will be played and enjoyed for decades to come. This film will go down in history as the best in it's genre. The unrated DVD collector's version is a must for anyone's library.,1
"It's a fantasy, after all. It's rather bawdy and over < br / > < br / > the top in spots, but that's just what the novel called for.",1
"I thought they were all terrific. < br / > < br / > One quick comment about the four actors who essay the primary roles. And I preferred way the novel let Nan "" come of age "" than the way Davies chose.",1
Not so with this. The characters are very human.,1
Class acting by Nana Patekar.,1
"I have nothing but praise for this mini series. Anyway, I digress.",1
( Can Keeley Hawes be more delicious?! ),1
"I guess this is a by - product of a good adaptation from a well written novel. She is funny, seductive and cute.",1
But I fear I must now change tack. Kudos. It's not a lesbian love story. < br / > < br / > You find me incensed.,1
"This film is not for the faint of heart, but it's not a piece of pro - gay advertising either. There's just so much more to it than that. Chancellor might have the stand out role, that is aside from Sally Hawkins who plays Zena Butler.",1
Well worth to be seen worldwide in cinemas. Unfortunately.,1
"< br / > < br / > Purple Storm was one of the best ones that I have seen this year. The consequences that he makes from his terrorist family, gives him a the choice of redemption.",1
"While during other movies I comment a lot. Kiarostami does. I found it charming! Nobody else but Kiarostami can do so little and, yet, get so much.",1
"So, the most hype performances were also the worst. The film's enjoyable because it's a delicious comedy.",1
"Screened this morning for the press at Roma film festival, "" N - io e Napoleone "" is easy to love. Now, of course he is going a way too far, but sure the boy can act. The cast is great too.",1
"Unfortunately, Martino is not able to put his design into action because Napoleon has other plans in mind. < br / > < br / > Elio Germano, a young Italian actor is the best thing in the movie. The young man comes from a sea merchant family. Napoleon is coming to his exile, not exactly a high point in his life.",1
A cool early 80s Aussie film. Sue ends up going out with Danny and Debbie with Garry.,1
"It shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating, sex, suicide etc etc. They had many of the same difficulties and hang - ups. Script wise there's nothing new here. The acting was just OK but the actors were attractive and this was well - made and pretty interesting. < br / > < br / > I caught this at an art cinema here in America in 1981. I give it 7.",1
"But yet, I felt i wanted more out of this game. It would be much better then. 7 / 10 STAR The missions were great.",1
"The multiplayer is still the best among the first - person shooters. Q gadgets abound in this game, including the famous watch. I still have not gotten through the 00 - Agent levels.",1
"Ab Tak Chappan however is even more entertaining. The dialogue is gritty, crude and at times hilarious.",1
Maybe it's the gadgets and weapons.,1
I have even made up my own missions for the levels. oh well let me get back to the game at hand. definitely the best game for N64 ever.,1
"This game is not exactly the best N64 game ever. Sure, it's good, but only when there's 4 players.",1
What can be said about one of the greatest N64 games ever? < br / > < br / > Very little beats Goldeneye 007.,1
"In fact, I recently bought an N64 purely so that I could own it and play it more often! ; - ) Ever since I first played it in 1998, GoldenEye has been one of my favourite video games.",1
Well worth a rent!,1
I can't help it I just can't get bored of it. Since that day close to seven years ago I have not stopped playing it.,1
"< br / > < br / > Let's face it - - most of the time movie - licensed games are flops. Although the two seem like a good mix, the results, for the most part, have been horrendous. You wear only the best Italian suits from Armani, hand stitched and fitted to your exact measurements. As a game, however, let ' In the case of Goldeneye, I had more reservations than normal. While not a bad movie, Goldeneye the film didn't have that much appeal to it, and I don't rank it in the top ten amongst Bond movies. 22 caliber gun.",1
Go play it sometime! My favorite was one with a tank. < br / > < br / > The game is simple.,1
"No music. Made by debut director Shamit Aman ( i think thats his name ). Movies which are either decent or really good, Ab Tak CHappan meanders close to very good. The plot though slightly predictable on review, is intriguing all the same. Really good stuff. THe one liners are just hilarious.",1
but none of them can stand up to GE007. The game itself is great.,1
Each time I play it I notice aspects that have been replicated in many following FPS games. Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well - aimed shot to the head. < br / > < br / > The introduction of logical hit - points on your enemies is a great feature.,1
"How? < br / > < br / > There are 20 action - packed levels, which is probably the most of any James Bond game to date. They just didn't use it. I also disliked that this game didn't have Q or M or Moneypenny, or anyone from MI6. When it came out, it was the greatest game of all - time, and even today, it stays strong. And while I do Even those little things can't really put this game down.",1
< br / > < br / > Overall score * * * * * * * * out of * * * * * * * * * * There is no way that you can't have a good time playing this game i loved it. Also the game follows the movie pretty much maybe a few added thing but it pretty much follows the movie.,1
"I hope other 007 games are produced. Now, I know how to win. The story is perfect. < br / > < br / > Fantastic job Rareware! But I still love Goldeneye. < br / > < br / > Better than this game? Magnificent job Nintendo! "". N64 games are usually very, very easy.",1
"I have never played any other shooting games, but I know that this one rules above all. com's Goldeneye website. It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest games of all time. I'm surprised I could have gone without it. It's too good to be true. Every James Bond lover will dig this game big time.",1
GoldenEye is a masterpiece.,1
"He portrays one of Tasha's "" yellow - shirted "" security guards. But at the end of the episode this same spacial anomaly possesses a valuable member of crowd.",1
"The special effects are also convincing and director Cliff Bole did his job well. He is the first one trying to compensate Trois lack in acting ability by improving her looks. "" Lonely among us "" definitely is one of the best first season episodes.",1
I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen. I have not seen Naach as yet but I am looking forward for it. I love the way he experiments.,1
"The lesbian scenes I felt was merely to put that point across. It is a metaphor for freedom. < br / > < br / > Bravo to Ms Mehta in translating her vision so clearly. An option to do what was perhaps unacceptable. What is life without desire, Radha questions Ashok. The movie is really about choices.",1
It is a riot from start to finish. ( godami! ) This is halfway to being a top movie. It turns out everyone was 100 % right!!!,1
"The excellent Joan Cusack's award winning performance is stellar and the great Bob Newhart is, well, Bob Newhart. Far from being a biting satire, the film tries for the exuberance of a Preston Sturges farce and comes damn close.",1
"It's a movie. In real life, the outcome of any individual is gonna be different as well. Each outing is different for each person. < br / > < br / > Overall, the performances were crazy. The storyline was made from an actual event.",1
"Is this'THE TWILIGHT ZONE '? "" This was because she was VERY conceited andnobby. That was absolutely hilarious!",1
"Now this floors Howard because he as no clue why thus guy would say this on international television. His parents ( Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds ) are shocked but promise to support their son, even if he is gay. Kevin Kline offers a brilliant comic turn in the 1997 comedy IN & OUT.",1
"Then again, it IS fiction. Joan Cusack steals the show!",1
This is truly a funny movie. She confirmed this in TV series'Will and Grace.,1
"But this is a farce and not real life. < br / > < br / > Tom Hanks'actual teacher criticized the graduation scene saying people don't act that way in real life. Here the Hanks character is played by Matt Dillon. The first, and far better, of Kevin Kline's two gay roles.",1
"Kline is always good, Cusack is a surprise Oscar nominee, and all supporting cast members do their bit too in this very funny comedy. Very good!",1
One exception for this is Ramgopal Verma movies.,1
"You guessed it, its Howard! This is a wonderful, funny, and humane film about a gay man and his situation. Then, too, the script, the direction, and the production are very, very nice. For those who would be offended by a gay - themed film, yes, just skip over this one.",1
"He is a gifted physical performer, but the film gives him only few moments to shine. Howard is middle aged, deeply closeted or in self - denial, and evidently has never had a sex life. < br / > < br / > Unfortunately, at the center of the film's humor lies a somewhat pathetic character.",1
This is a not - to - be - missed film.,1
She was more interesting to me than all the lead actors.,1
"Hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated gays as lepers. Gay movie characters have covered a lot of ground since "" Advise and Consent. """,1
I have seen this movie many times and i never get sick of it. I found the movie very funny and heart - warming.,1
"It would have been truer to the message. The fiance and parents did a great job as a supporting cast. Rather than setting Howard free, it pigeon holes him. Oh, he likes to dance to music, than he must be gay. It almost becomes bland with the rest.",1
"< br / > < br / > Sure, the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending, but... few movies are perfect.",1
The thought of Kevin Kline being gay was very funny.,1
One wonders why he is always not given his accolades during awards season. Won't dissapointed with this cops and robbers flick.,1
"In & Out is a comedy with a simple premise. A solid "" B. The cast makes this film successful.",1
< br / > < br / > I love this movie!,1
And Bob Newhart is also a hoot as the homophobic principal. Joan Cusack really has a knack for screwball antics.,1
"how long were they can keep this? so natural feelings, so plain and barren words. in another word, the elder brother is very cute. if we were part, what should they do?",1
"The first time i watched it, i was blind.",1
"< br / > < br / > Thanks for listening, enjoy.",1
I can't recommend it highly enough. < br / > < br / > Anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this film and absorb its message. This film succeeds in every respect. I've watched many short films in my day.,1
I just watched this short at the PlanetOut Movies.,1
He described some scenes to me. Hats off to star crossed.,1
Nevertheless I liked it.,1
"I still remember watching Satya for the first time. Editing seems non - existent and hence effective. I was completely blown away. The scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster Oh My God! Sandeep Srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer. Nakul Vaid as the rookie Jatin Shukla was a revelation. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so believable.",1
"I don't know how she keeps her hands off this beautiful Indian man! Still - there's Mr. Waterston! But, rent it and enjoy! Other sub - plots are really unnecessary.",1
< br / > < br / >'t miss it. Lovely to read.,1
"Eagle's Wing "" is a pleasant surprise of a movie, & keeps the viewer interested. As well as the complexities of the characters it presents. """,1
American Indians probably stole more than killed. Thankfully not another mindless shoot em up. Who really knows? All good. I have hopes nobody dissects this film.,1
Who should own it? And Eagle's Wing is such a horse. More's the pity. Altogether this is an extraordinary film. But for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter.,1
"An unusual, revisionist western, well worth watching. Sam Waterston as an Indian?",1
"The former seems to have the upper hand. < br / > < br / > But Pike notes at the beginning that the film will attend to the period of primitivism before civilisation. But this crackpot film is something else. < br / > < br / > The basic story intercuts three stories. < br / > < br / > Although a revisionist Western, the treatment of the Indian is problematic. The vast scrub and desert of the film's landscape is unbroken, ripe for allegories of the mind. The film has an air of timeless fable about it, while dealing specifically with Western mythology.",1
"Which is hard to do with a vampire movie. One minute action, the next pure comedy. So for a movie with a few good fights and a chuckle or two this is rather good... though why was it rated? I enjoyed this movie okay, it just could have been so much better.",1
The SFX are great. I KNOW vampire movies. < br / > < br / > I own this on DVD and would not part with.,1
It is by far the most definitive film on the police force which I have seen. The change in working conditions with the change of senior is dealt wonderfully. Definitely not to be missed.,1
"< br / > < br / > The direction is crisp and the script is sharp. This bloody work is carried out by some martial artists who drink a little vampire blood to give them the edge they need, well it must be thirsty work! It is the twins that really make the film ; with some of the freshest and funniest acting going. The twins effect is a vampire martial arts movie available in Cantonese with English subtitles. To add the cherry on the cake twins are both quite lovely to watch too.",1
"Charlene and Gillian are naturally cute, charismatic, and humorous. Even the abominably horrible Ekin Cheng was good in this one. It's not even close. < br / > < br / > And speaking of action, this film has plenty of it.",1
It's a shame the story is such a wreck.,1
"Who did you liked best ( person )?. I liked Reeve a bit. PLEASE, please please? What did you liked? How about you? It was worth it!",1
And Jackie Chan.,1
"< br / > < br / > The story is pretty poor overall. This movie, as my Chinese girlfriend informed me, features two well - known Hong Kong pop stars.",1
"If you go into the Twins Effect looking for a pure Hong Kong movie experience you will be disappointed. I liked it a lot for a variety of reasons, not least it's wonderful female leads who spark off each other in a thoroughly entertaining comedy double act. Despite this, it does have a few sticking points. The sequence with the disco - dancing vampires is a total classic. < br / > < br / > For the non - purists and those with more forgiving tastes though, Twins Effect is a delightfully silly kung - fu comedy. < br / > < br / > The action is a blend of two genres really. It has to be said the slapstick is immense fun too.",1
"It has really nothing to do with the plot, but it's still entertaining. Although cheesy in some respects, it still pulls it off.",1

"Well, I am still lost in this question. Reality is just too scary. Guess what? - - moreso than crafted work? Is improvisation heroic, "" artier ""? I'm on break. I wasn't given the "" changes, "" don't know the "" score, "" and am not schooled in the genre.",1

Hey ; Belmondo!,1
The depths of emotion that Cassavetes is able to draw out of the smallest gestures and interactions is incredible. This is truly a magnificent landmark of film that I would recommend to anyone interested in exploring beyond Hollywood mold.,1
This intimate approach led to some incredibly daring work in Facesi.,1
"It was, regarding to the cinematic depiction of racism, a breakthrough film in the US. Shadows breathes the smell of New York's streets like no film before it. Revealingly, none of those three doubtlessly extremely talented actors was able to start a big career afterwards. There's not much happening in the plot.",1
I would highly recommend this film.,1
"The answer is yes. Shadows "" is absolutely mandatory viewing for film buffs. Still, the film's story is remains powerful. Plus, the acting, considering the inexperience of cast and improvisational nature, is phenomenal.",1
"The answer of course, is sure, we all do.",1
"< br / > < br / > Although my favourite Cassevettes film is'Husbands ', this one is his most important. Cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves.",1

"That Rupert keeps encouraging If some things did not make much sense logically, so be it. Cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films.",1
Sidney Poitier ). This is done very well and makes the movie very special.,1
"When she falls in love with a white jerk named Tony, he is unpleasantly surprised when he finds out she's black, and from there it goes on about the three main characters'individual aspirations and shortcomings. I suspect that Cassavetes had the plot organized enough, and it was just the dialogue that was improvised. What's amazing is the extent of the amateur actors'embodiment of their characters. At first I didn't like Lelia, but as the film progressed you see more and more she's one of those actors who gets better as the tension and drama builds - not necessarily best with small talk. Shadows is hailed by many as the forerunner of the indie film movement ( made in 1959 ) and it's definitely recommended. Overall, I suppose it's really about stasis vs. change in human life.",1
"Dated, to be sure, but worth a glance for film buffs ; Martin Scorsese named this as one of his heaviest influences.",1
"I must admit, it took me a a while before I actually enjoyed the film.",1
It's adjusted to the pictures. I enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera.,1
"1959 was a landmark in the world of film. < br / > < br / > At the same time, two films appeared that hinted at a whole new way of making films. Godard was still a believer in the director as arbiter of style. In certain ways, though, they couldn't be farther apart. < br / > < br / > It doesn't reach it, mainly because naturalism is a myth, particularly in cinema.",1
"And the few fantasy sequences didn't really work. The scenes between Malick andikenberry are VERY good. The performances were uniformly very good, too. Sometimes the framing or staging seemed a bit off, or awkward. The closeups seemed overused ( or erratically used ) to me.",1
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip. I don't think you will be disappointed.,1
Looking forward to future projects by this production company.,1
! There should more movies like this!!,1
Watching this movie was a most pleasant experience.,1
"Which is not surprising. A film to watch, meditate, discuss and act upon.",1
This film has it all and more.,1
They all become what they were destined to be. < br / > < br / > While Manna offers the familiar Hollywood storyline of Good vs.,1
This is a truly independent film. ( thanks Ursula! ) People need to feel good.,1
I was so pleasantly surprised!,1
"The movie teaches us that it is not money, but ourselves that make our and other's dreams come true. Every action has an outcome not just for you, but the community around you. Either you are left walking out of the theater asking, "" Why? Years pass and we find Theresa returned home to her native Buffalo.",1
"The characters really are "" characters "". Manna from Heaven is heavenly.",1
Bravo to the Five Sisters.,1
What more can any film do? How do you repay a gift from God?,1
This was a random rental at the video store. But I was impressed from the start. Wooden Camera is a gem of a 2nd feature by an engaging director.,1
"< br / > < br / > GO SEE THIS MOVIE! If you've never been to Buffalo, you'll leave the theater with thoughts of ""huffling off "" for a visit! The quiet beauty of the "" Queen City of the Great Lakes "" compliments, rather than detracts from the tale that is being told.",1
!,1
"Try it... you'll like it! I'm just grateful that Manna From Heaven dropped down on us. The absence of sex, vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening.",1
I give it an 11 out of 10!,1
"The Squire of Gothos is one of the "" sillier "" episodes of Star Trek, and therefore one of the most entertaining ones.",1
This was a nice film.,1

"So, I would say the ending left me disappointed. ! Still, Go See It!",1
"Pretty soon it becomes clear that Trelayne is not just an immature god, but a very fallible one. It is well worth it. The environment is subtly inauthentic, and the crew immediately begins to spot the inconsistencies.",1
"But, despite this, the episode was enjoyable and worth my time.",1
Too bad the show never fully explored this iconic figure.,1
"In a way, you can't take your eyes off him, always waiting to see what he does next. He brings them all back, including some female companionship, to continue his games. Actor John de Lancie captured that similar tone as Q on the Next Generation series.",1
"Well worth the time. This film follows a group of tribesmen on their annual two month quest to get salt. For some peoples, life still proceeds at the same pace which it has for thousands of years.",1
"Interesting film, but very long. But do put on a big pot of coffee, it'll help. I think Gerard's comments on the doc hit the nail on the head.",1
And made us see that there was more to life than the shopping mall and pop culture.,1
It's a shame this movie was never released on DVD. !,1
"However, logically spoken, the only reason why we have just one identity, is the fact that our logic has only two values ( right and false ). Now take a logic with just one more value, i. e. with three : Then, as you can easily see, you have already three identities. What happens now, when, let us say, Dr. Stiller gets killed? Fassbinder was a master to sell highly abstracts contents to his public by embedding theoretical knowledge into practical, appetizing forms.",1
"Quite obviously, it is an investigation into the nature of modern love.",1
"He knows his very existence is nothing more than electrical impulses, how does he deal with this knowledge? Instead of an unreliable narrator we have an unreliable world.

Great!,1
But it Wes clear they did not know what to do. No real goal. They might have had a good life if they had any idea how. They had no idea how to have a goal. I felt bad but could not stop watching the movie. You know. It could depress you. This movie had me in not the best mood. They had no direction. I like them or I don't.,1

"Seth was great, too. I like movies about quirky people. """,1
"The score and music selections fit perfectly, and there is plenty of action to prevent the movie becoming just a character study. If you want the story, you won't find it in this review, but I will say that the climax will haunt you for long time.",1
Wow! I so recommend this movie to anyone with the ability of vision.,1
"It's hard to explain, but see it and find out for yourself. It'definitely worth it.",1

"Films of this calibre, as shown, don't come often.",1

A must see. : - (.,1
The theatre I saw it in does not exist any and has given way to a shopping mall. It'll be really worth it. And I don't want to throw away the experiences of a memory of this movie into the wind. What a movie and what a moment that was!,1
"< br / > < br / > YOU'RE A SAP MR. JAP ( Famous Studios / Paramount Pictures, 1942 ) is a prime example of just what we're talking about. < br / > < br / > WE were truly surprised to see that there seem to be volumes of such animated short subjects. THE FEELING of the need to have someone play the role of Arbiter of Public Taste and Political Correctness always manages to get under our skin.",1
"Keep in mind, though, that there was a war going on at time.",1
"( Incidentally, why were the "" Japs "" always pictured with big, round glasses and bucked teeth? Why, you double - crossing Ja - pansies!, "" yells our Sailor Man. ).",1
Recommended. This is an average short.,1
Not IMHO.,1

"How odd ). I very much enjoyed Garbo's performance, as she sustains the film through even the most meandering moments. We'll be sure to watch for that to change as our odyssey continues.",1
A great movie!,1
< br / > < br / > An interesting slice of movie history. ' Anne Christie'was Garbo's 14th film and the first in which her husky Swedish voice was heard.,1
Robeson is majestic. These were very progressive films for their time.,1
"It ’ s not light fare, not fun, not for everyone. Here her look isn't glamorous, it's tortured. Garbo is actually easiest to understand. < br / > < br / > The films strong point is Greta Garbo.",1
"All the while Garbo ( at the front of the crowd ) watches. < br / > < br / > Garbo of course is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie. She plays all sides of her character. Garbo is of course famous first as a silent actress, and this is her talking film debut. It has drama.",1
It is an amazing performance. Amazing. This film is worthwhile despite what you may hear.,1
< br / > < br / > It was no accident that Anna Christie was chosen for Garbo. It's one of O'Neil's best known works and one that's revived frequently. And with those words one of the great movie publicity campaigns came to a conclusion. Greta Garbo received an The role of Anna on stage was done by Pauline Lord.,1
A film film. Hmmmm. < br / > < br / > People!!! It was really silly to mix this short with Modern Love - which is a serious drama movie.,1
"And it's a wonderful performance from the Divine One, in a role that is really quite atypical for her. I ' It's an early talkie with primitive technical aspects. < br / > < br / > I believe "" Anna Christie "" is still one of Garbo's most iconic performances. This performance seems quite raw from Garbo. I'd read all the negative reviews for "" Anna Christie "". But her past threatens to ruin it all. Yep, there's a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences. The pair have great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with one another. She's not weighed down by heavy dresses or make - up.",1
"< br / > < br / > This little change is interesting. What the League of Decency must have thought of that! For Greta Garbo's first talking picture, MGM wisely chose Eugene O'Neill's Pultizer Prize winning 1921 play ANNA Christie.",1
"Let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs. In other words, we all strive to answer the question if the movie has stood a test of time. Has it? And it was no coincidence that it was Clarence Brown who directed the first talkie with the Swedish beauty. 78 years ago... the premiere of "" Anna Christie "" advertised by the slogan "" Garbo Talks! """,1
"She did. See this one for Garbo and Dressler! This Eugene O'Neill play is a true classic yet, oddly, was never filmed again. Garbo was 25 ; Dressler was 60.",1
"Marie Dressler is also in the O'Neill swing of things. Garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent films, and her entrance is still classic. As Garbo's ( very ) confused father, George Marion seems truly from another time.",1
I would say that this film is disturbing.,1
"He goes to prison, taken from the only things he wants - his shop and daughter. And it certainly works. < br / > < br / > The film opens with a horse being killed. If you can, watch these two films, this one first. Also, he is not afraid of showing violence, as viewers of Irreversible will know. She is however mute, and the subject of bullying and toying.",1
"Try and watch this little film first if you can. I watched the films the wrong way about, Seul Contre Tous first. He hates many things.",1
"Don't watch it if you want to have a lite, relaxing time. The movie is full of metaphor, but I'll let you figure them out. I don't mind gore in generally, but this isn't even gore, it's real butchering.",1
The story is of a butcher who wrongfully kills an innocent man who he believes has sexually molested his retarded daughter. This short film certainly pulls no punches.,1
"Apparently he's spent much of the last year traveling the world with the film, mostly in Europe. He doesn't drink booze and plays cricket once a week. and that he plays piano which helps him to think. Hear hear!",1
"Perhaps this movie is a little too long, but it still has some charm 45 years later. The main roles seem more appropriate for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh.",1
"I first saw this movie when I was in elementary school, back in the 1960s. The chemistry between the two is great. During this time she meets the wonderful Clint Maroon, played by Gary Cooper.",1
"You name it, she was all those things and more. What love!",1
I loved this movie and it has stayed with me for years. ! Both Bergman and Cooper were excellent.,1
"In a way, this film is all smoke & mirrors. Ingrid is at her best & plays this role well.",1
And any other actress would have made it maybe a 6.,1

9. Well done Nick Gomez. IMDb Rating : 5.,1
WOW I Love this movie.,1
"It just so happens that area is pretty rough. I'd say the acting is good all - around, too. Hopefully, the new mayor of Newark is making progress.",1
"This happens to be Newark, N. J., a rust - belt city low on jobs but notoriously high on crime. When the boys steal a police car in retribution for the ambush, things predictably go downhill fast. The film's "" us vs. the law "" mentality is underscored by the all - black neighborhood vs. the nearly all - white police force. They only run into real trouble when the police ambush them. It's like a bushwhacking from an old Western, but the contemporary setting makes it look all too real.",1
I bought it on DVD. I was impressed.,1
SEEHIS FILM!,1
"I admire the work Nick Gomez and Spike Lee put into this masterpiece of a movie. The only misfortune to come from this movie was fact that many people "" slept "" on it. Nothing was compromised in order to make good "" theater "". New Jersey Drive "" was an uncompromising piece of "" in your face "" reality.",1

I see that despite the escape he is now released. A pity the Soviets are no longer around to accept the wretch! A Cheery Cheri!,1
"Then he bids goodbye and buries it. Perhaps it isn't a coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival where Modern Love had its premiere.

In the shack where the old man once lived everything is covered with dust. < br / > < br / > In Sokurov's The Second Circle a young man returns to the Russian countryside to bury his deceased father.",1
"Don't believe me? Why? Then look at the Walker Family Spy Ring which was broken in the late'80s. The movie is based on a true story. Boyce was an avid falconer and Lee was a coke head. In a word, greed.",1

"This film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screening. An interesting exploration into family relationships, and environments.",1
"One thing about the movie that just turns me on is the music. Irene Cara has a great voice and is a great actress. They all had a hard time, but made it their own way. ! I like the way the movie focused on many ethnic groups. I have never heard anything like it!!!",1

"And the homosexual guy - isn't there a whole controversy today about gay marriage, blah, blah? Who doesn't want to be famous? NOT outdated.",1
I expected FAME to be an uplifting film but it ended up the opposite. I think Laura Dean as Lisa Monroe is my favorite character.,1

"Any movie that moves me this much is a winner in my book. A must - see! Irene Cara can really act, and it's not only her singing that makes her shine here as Coco. The film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer. Lee Curreri is very good as Bruno. < br / > < br / > This is truly an amazing film. """,1

Did either make it? ). Many plot lines are brought up and completely left open - ended by the end of the movie. BUT this film misses the boat in the drama department.,1
I saw Fame when it first came out.,1
I give it 8 1 / 2 10.,1

"But I don't care, because the real stars are... < br / > < br / >... the musical scenes! I recommend it once a year ; sure not for everyone. The editing i think is wonderful, really fast and often funny. One of my favorites : the hot - lunch - jam sequence.",1
"My vote is seven. Anyway, "" Fame "" is still a delightful entertainment and a cult - movie for me. The story follows too many characters and leaves many situations without answer.",1
Of course it did.,1
"Best of luck to the team who arrived at this film. It's a Grand Guignol, a little masterpiece of noir.",1
"It meandered, but did feel like a slice of life. We couldn't escape the titular song on the radio. This movie holds a special place in the hearts of the Class of'80. High school. For the most part, it succeeded. But few find it easy to forget. Like them, not all of us made it.",1
"Once the first year of classes gets going, the film settles into a nice groove. Now, everyone wants to be famous. It used to be doctors and firemen that kids wanted to be. The acting is for the most part top - drawer with a few exceptions.",1
Fame'( 1980 ) is brilliant.,1
Now I am trying to buy ` Chameleon 2 '. My vote is seven. I am becoming a fan of this good entertainment.,1
Will there be more? Where was this filmed?,1
Great job!,1
"The sound is all psychological, the music builds the tension. film making.",1
I hope there'more! I always hate when actors are not believable in action parts. I was VERY impressed. I LOVED this movie because Bobbie Phillips can REALLY FIGHT!,1

Unbelievable.,1
"Edgar Rice Burroughs probably approved. After 16 years talking monosyllabically Weismuller seemed awkward stringing sentences together, not that it mattered. Although personally I wouldn't have minded this going on another couple of hours as well! Johnny Sheffield also gave up playing Boy to become Bomba the Jungle Boy in a series of 12 films.",1
"Mitchell Leison may have missed some opportunities here and there, but he fully took advantage of others. Both agents ( Bruce Lester and Ray Milland ) escape into the countryside and split up. Milland happens upon gypsy woman Marlene Dietrich one evening as she's alone at her camp preparing dinner.",1
"The character's eagerness to feed Milland and look after him more closely resembles the good German hausfrau Dietrich was off the set than her mannered vamp roles. ( The English say "" leftenant. "" His only excuse is that she smells, so perhaps a stuffy, fastidious Englishman might indeed be put off. We are told at the beginning that he hero - worships Milland, and indeed he rather fawns on him. Those reviewers who have complained that this movie lacks plausibility or has problems of construction are missing the point. Dance, gypsies! Buttoned - up Ray Milland makes an amusing foil for a Dietrich with black hair, tattered scarves, and tons of jewelry.",1
Dietrich plays against her usual type. The rest of the film is flashback. This is Denistoun's world. A messenger delivers a small box to him which he opens to find a pair of gold earrings.,1
"I had never seen Dietrich play a "" good "" woman convincingly before - - but she does here! The movie was a joy to watch ; it's a classic. < br / > < br / > Overall, a very nice romance. I should not have worried.",1
"China, Korea, Canada, USA and Australia and many of these stories are indicating that the world is really valley of tears. Frayne's movie is super. Modern love... thats for sure. Visual intelligence and unique sensibility of some Australian directors is astonishing good.",1
"He was very magnetic in the short time he was on film and I just loved his deep and beautiful voice. I am really surprised that this film only has a rating of 6. But here, she showed she really could act. I don't necessarily blame Dietrich for the silly vampish films she made in the 1930s - - audiences loved them and they did make her famous. 4 as of the time I did this review. < br / > < br / > Finally, a sad note to consider. While the film While not exactly a great film, I do think it's one of the best films Dietrich did and it's a shame it isn't more highly regarded. Also, please note the performance of Murvyn Vye as "" Zoltan "".",1

"It's a shaggy dog story, with Matthieu Kassovitz's simpleton following unlucky - in - cards drifter Jean Louis Trintignant with mutt - like devotion that even stretches to killing for him when he's asked to repay his gambling debts in kind.",1
The film tells two stories in parallel. Some scenes are truly hilarious. I wish I could describe this better.,1
"I saw this on the Accent Underground release with the short films. So 10 out of 10 to you. I couldn't stop thinking about why, so I got up, switched the TV back on, loaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie.",1
It's a movie about something that exists and people and their motivation to use it. Funny and entertaining.,1
So I wasn't only one guffawing! I thought this was a Good Thing. But I think Ralf Westhoff succeeded with wit and élan.,1
"< br / > < br / > Sebastian Weber : Silent waters are deep! Hey, this Ralf Westhoff seems to knows a lot about people! It's great to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces.

The whole audience loved it. You'll love it! So please watch it if there's possibility.,1
"Overall this movie was educational, but also very entertaining. In my opinion most important task was to reveal to the people who the Pope started out as.",1
"Otherwise, what a heartbreaking waste of great talent. Great movie about a great man. It speaks volumes for the casting director. Of course he looks so hot in the uniforms.",1
His credibility never wavered. He has an amazing range and depth. He did a remarkable job in conveying the emotions and strife that John - Paul endured.,1
"Definitely a B movie, but nonetheless really worth checking out. Very funny.",1

Nuri Bilge Ceylan's 2002 film Distant ( Uzak ) - his third feature film ( his first was 1997's black and white The Small Town - Kasaba ), is a significant step up from his good but flawed 1999 film Clouds Of May ( Mayis Sikintisi ). The earlier film had potential, but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways - plot holes and wooden acting from amateurs. In another scene, Ceylan similarly quotes a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from Ozu's Tokyo Story.",1

"That is the kind of sincerity you'll find in Uzak. Rather, it's a film in which they act as real as it can be. Actually, they are not professional actors at all. You show the same signs of nuisance to an unwanted guest. This is the same feeling of disconnection that you get in modern city life.

"You are the director and you are writing the scenario while you watch it. I felt like that I'm reading L'etrang from Camus. For me, the time I spend on watching a film is the only time which I go to another world.",1
It's horrible.,1
"All the little failed attempts to connect and petty cruelties ring so true. < br / > < br / > It's a long film with very little dialogue and a quite limited plot. People don't grapple with events and problems, so much as with each other. For me at least, I believed entirely in the behaviour of his characters. This has evidently annoyed a fair few viewers.",1
Watch it with your kids ( or your horse ). One of my favorite movies.,1
"The film is unique in many ways. Reading some of the other reviews of this film, i was reminded of both good and not so good aspects of it. It uses little dialogue, but communicates a tremendous amount. Who has not felt such ambivalence - when losing friend or lover, or in some other situation?",1

It's an impossible film to easily explain which is one of its many strengths. Suffice it to say it's an adult fairy tale with many carefully layered levels of meaning. I plan to revisit this film several times when it comes to my neighberhood theater. It is a work of meticulous craftsmanship and a sophistication of writing not seen in most American movies.,1

"Take, for example, the dinner segment with deep - voiced and androgynous waitress. Imagery controls this film. The characters, although interesting, ultimately take a back seat. The dead have to be accounted for and lifted to a better place.",1
"This firm grounding redounds to great credit for writers and directors Mark and Michael Polish. It is a rare and fine spectacle, an allegory of death and transfiguration that is neither preachy nor mawkish.",1
"This is best to be viewed late at night so that the haunting imagery can linger in your mind and wash over you as you drift off into sleep. A little orphan boy is dying, and a town is about to flooded in the name of progress ( in the form a damn and hydroelectric power plant ).",1

It is a precious jewel. !,1

"I watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations, having just graduated college and moved on to "" real life "".",1
"Appearances by Bobcat Goldthwait and Wink Martindale, as themselves, is an added bonus. Cinematography and sets are top notch.",1
!,1
They basically had some terrorists take a van or two and rent them out to be car bombs. I really liked this movie. I watched it last night on the Public Broadcasting System.,1
"Before seeing this picture I was quite skeptic, I don't like movies with an agenda nor do I appreciate being scared into thinking like the writer. I was also afraid this would be like the 2 - part mini - series "" 10. The message that is being conveyed is obvious from start : It is coming and we're not prepared.",1
And I took the train from Waterloo station many times. < br / > < br / > This was not a Tom Clancy film. Not the slightest urge to channel surf. This film had neither. Right now.,1
"< br / > < br / > The acting is superb, the writing is spectacular. ! < br / > < br / > Dirty War is a must see!!",1
"Performances are proper, understated though never terrific.",1
"Yes, the truth is stranger than fiction.",1
"! Rusty's room mate, Dale played by Clark Duke is hilarious as well.",1
"As in, what if terrorists exploded a'dirty bomb'in a big city, in this case, London. This is fairly realistic and yes, even scary. And could this happen right here in the good old USA? 8 out of. You can bet not.",1
"Daniel Percival's "" Dirty War "", a BBC production made for television was shown recently on cable. < br / > < br / > The last images of the film have a chilling effect.",1
"Well this movie certainly was in keeping with the current times. There was meant to be shock - value in the bombing incident. Films like this are needed to keep us aware of what is out there. No happy endings, super - heroes, or miracles here.",1
"The BBC and HBO teamed up to create "" Dirty War "", a 90 minute TV movie about a terrorist "" dirty bomb "" attack in London. ( )",1
I enjoy watching the reruns and I am a big fan. Which I thought was a cool song for the show.,1
Both physically and figuratively. This isn't a bad thing though. Someone out there wanna get on that?,1
What a program! Giambone was a real favourite! OH Night Heat!,1
9 / 10. The film's pace is numbingly slow and precious little actually happens between the two.,1
"< br / > < br / > This is Cantonese Visconti. For my money, it's worth seeing for that alone.",1
I don't miss the show for NOTHING!,1
Close ups predominated it. Silence and slow movements characterize the movie. Some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close - ups. In short I would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in cinema. Only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it.,1
"Simply being in love is far from enough. Fidelity, social mores, and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into fruition. Despite their not wanting to stoop to their respective spouses'level, it happened.",1
"A piece with prelude, stanzas, and epilogue. Wong Kar - Wai is resourceful that way.",1
Love! Nat King Cole singing in French absolutely sets the tone for the whole movie.,1
Wong Kar - Wai sees things very differently.,1
"In the Mood for Love "" a teasing allegory of loneliness and longing. This movie worked for me because I can identify with that feeling.",1
Well i like them and i like this film too.,1
"What a superb film. WHAT AN AWESOME FILM!!!!!!!! It'a visual feast, and hard not to like.",1
But this show is anything but!,1
"At least that's the feeling I get. Chiu leaves the country, only to come back years later, when everything has changed. Can't anyone say anything good about love after it has been achieved by two individuals? What films in history have achieved, approached, or sustained this phrase, if for only a short while? < br / > < br / > Two people move into a somewhat communal household setting. Or, if you are inclined to entirely incomplete minimalism, hits it right on the mark. < br / > < br / > In the Mood for Love is For a long time I did not know weather I liked this film or not.",1
"Don't miss it. Not to mention the flowery "" Cheung Sam "". The whole movie pretty much fit the title. Great cinematography by Wong and Christopher Doyle. As a point of reference, CTHD only got 7. Beautiful, emotional, and subtle.",1
"Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung play Chow Mo - wan and Su Li - zhen Chan. Kar Wai Wong's incredibly impressive romance that is to me, perfect. Combined. She's a scene - stealer. Su Li - zhen Chan is a secretary. Chang, also the production designer creates a brilliant A world that creates these characters. Chow Mo - wan works for a newspaper company. Set in 1960's Hong Kong.",1
"it is a difficult film and mostly not entertaining. it is very slow moving and the subtle. this film is wonderful film for students of film. < br / > < br / > this is a love story that offers no sex. to be honest, i can't even recall the characters kissing. it is a piece of art.",1
"In all of Wong's films these are the leitmotives. In The Mood For Love "" is told from a child perspective, but the child never appears as a narrator. Love, whether it comes too early or it comes too late to take one and not the other person. The dialogue is mostly completely unimportant. You wish that they will find each other. < br / > < br / > It is about broken luck and unspoken love. SPOILER ALERT!!!",1
"Later, the director edited his story based on the footages. My vote is eight. 'In the Mood for Love'is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of platonic and repressed love.",1
It's sexy without showing everything. A really lovely film.,1
"In short, Mr Chow and Mrs Chan sacrifices their relationship for the future of their child. Next scene : Mrs Chan leans her head on Mr Chow in the taxi and says "" I don't want to go home tonight "". The answer is that this whole story takes place in Hong Kong during the Sixties.",1
"The question is, should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners?",1
"Probably every college bound freshmens worst nightmare. < br / > < br / > I am definitely looking forward to the return of Greek. What didn't she have? Oh thats right.. Evan all to herself. < br / > < br / > Luckily, it covered everything. So Jen K was fairly crazy, but she actually liked Rusty. < br / > < br / > Rustys sister Casey was pretty much the typical girl on campus EVERYONE is jealous of.",1
"It has all bold beauty of Doyle, without, frankly, the Athena - poster cheesiness of his work on Hero. But this lazy feel conceals a quite tightly constructed film. The music, as always with Wong, is prominent. < br / > < br / > Possibly, In the Mood for Love is not to everyone's taste.",1
"The dialogue is sparse but like the rest of the movie, is imbued with meaning. Speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is infectious. Used here it becomes a story telling device. A very beautiful movie.",1
And of course the performances of the actors which makes the love so real. The content and the form overlaps perfectly.,1
I was recommended this film as one of the best love stories ever told. I just couldn't go passed the language barrier and the cultural barrier. and the cinematography.,1
Unmissable. All the film revolves around that and the rest is pure enhancement. No doubt the director's method has a lot to do with that. A romance that never feels forced or fake.,1
It's easy to see why many people consider In the Mood for Love to be Wong Kar - Wai's best film. It's also telling that Kar - Wai never chooses to focus on physicality of Mo - Wan and Li - zhen's spouses.,1
"Make no mistake about it : In the Mood for Love was the most gorgeous film of 2001. < br / > < br / > Several factors are responsible for making In the Mood for Love a new classic among "" romantic melodramas, "" in the best sense of that term. So, given this cinematic climate, Wong Kar - wai's latest film feels like a much needed breath of fresh air.",1
At least that's the way I saw it. Enjoy it for what it is - small entertaining film. It was definitely worth the rental.,1
A worthy addition to the history of the psychedelic sixties. I'd like to see this available at any home video retail outlet without any hassle. Superb and charming.,1
"And, not only that, they had the musical chops to back it up. This provides my only complaint about the film. And, don't forget to view The Extras.",1
! I really like the show!!,1
I see that there are others out there who feel the same. Isn't that enough! What can we do to get this done?,1
'so everyone could enjoy it? Come on BBC. Clear it and license it please.,1
So glad to see it coming out on DVD! My introduction to a lifelong love of Shakespeare.,1
"Further proof of how timeless Shakespeare truly is. Was it worth it? I and many others have been petering BBC for tape or DVD ever since. The video is clear and very good, the sound is flawless. Now all of a sudden, here it is on Amazon.",1
I used to read the plays at the pace of the series.,1
"PBS HAS JUST ISSUED A DVD OF "" AN AGE OF KINGS ""! I JUST ORDERED MINE!",1
org. Both series benefit from integral casting.,1
"< br / > < br / > This isn't a show for over - sensitive Greeks. But everyone else should have a ton of fun watching it. It'nothing new, but when it comes to college, nothing ever is.",1
"If you get a chance to see it, not miss it.",1
"Are you reading this, BBC?",1
She was very lovely then as now.,1
All of the performances were brilliant. < br / > < br / > Character development is the movie's finest feature.,1
This film is a masterpiece. Anderson's use of widescreen will suffer on TV ( so get the DVD or a letterbox tape ). ). The editing by Dylan Tichenor is simply phenomenal.,1
"Look at ratio it was shot in! Yes, it is a rip off of Goodfellas. < br / > < br / > Nuff said! This deserves the FULL SCREEN experience.",1
This movie has it all.,1
Not to mention a nearly unrecognizable Alfred Molina. An interesting companion piece to true documentaries of John C. Holmes.,1
"I don't remember exactly how it ended, but I remember, it finished with a great climax, and a good twist. com!",1
And the story? What a movie! WOW!,1
"He changes his name for Dirk Diggler and starts to make a huge success. Each feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, resulting in a masterpiece of the modern American cinema. The other pictures which were nominated in the main category were "" L. A. Eddie has a special'gift ', and this helps him to get into the world of porn movies. But fame... doesn't last forever. Each character is very well developed, and each of them has his / her importance in the context. < br / > < br / > "" Boogie Nights "" is a strong, impacting picture that should be seen by everyone who really likes cinema.",1
You will find yourself wishing for and hoping their situations improve. All - in - all a well done film.,1
"Everything in it was so amazing. Oh don't get me started on the music in this film. The film is very respectable with it'ripoff's. < br / > < br / > This movie just touched my heart. So I rent it. PT Andderson is one of the greats. Obviously ripped off from "" I Am Cuba. "" Anderson is obviously a film lover.",1
"This sort of exploitation films are an amazing success and for Jack are his firsts "" real "" films. That sequence is the one of his first drug deal, with the appearance of Alfred Molina, which ends in a total mess. And that's how the story of the young Eddie in the porn industry begins. But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the "" horrible 80's "" when there is going to be $ ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and pals.",1
I've seen it three times now so I know.,1
"Altman and Scorsese have twisted sex together in one of the greatest American films of the past 20 years. His room is soaked in muscle - bound, naive Americana. And then watch it again. It sizzles and never fizzles. Fame and fortune make Dirk's acquaintance, as do a bevy of local porn celebs.",1
This is all revealed pretty early on in the plot. There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography.,1
"< br / > < br / > P. T Anderson. An amazing director who made Boogie Nights amazing. Some scenes are breathtaking, literally. A great story, a great movie.",1
"Maybe even better. Overall, a wonderful film.",1
"Dirk's real name is Eddie Adams, a Californian who dreams of becoming a star. True Hollywood Story special.",1
"He becomes a "" big "" porno star ( no pun intended ) and seems to be on top of everything. I especially liked Don Cheadle's role as Buck the stereo salesman. < br / > < br / > BOOGIE NIGHTS is a really well - filmed drama. A 90s classic!",1
The approach is awful! ! That is a film that will stay in film history whether u like it or not!,1
"But the thing is, the whole film isn't really about porn. Excellent film, one of the best!",1
"This story is about success, it's about failure. Keep this in mind as you watch the movie ; it'more than eye candy.",1
"There is not one scene in this movie that isn't amazing. Beyond the multiple character study, is the use of music in the film. The direction is among the best I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of films. I can actually understand why many would dislike it, due to the subject matter. The individual characters reach out and touch you. < br / > < br / > The film isn't about one particular personal individual's story, it's about many.",1
It deserves everyccolade it has achieved and more.,1
I love the vision of Chris Shaw. The plot was only important from second to second.,1
This was a bold movie to hit Indian cinemas when it was released.,1
Very few movies can claim this triple crown.,1
Boogie Nights deals with the pornography theme with some control. < br / > < br / > The This is where Dirk finds initial success.,1
"People say I look like Han Solo. "" OK, back to performances. But honestly, Boogie Nights brings back the pure, no - bul! < br / > < br / > The music, like in any great film, is a character of its own.",1
"The acting is by no means perfect, nor were they bad. In the end, I was thoroughly impressed with film in most aspects. < br / > < br / > It is definitely a film i would recommend. I was nicely surprised by how much i did not waste my money.",1
"Emotionally tense with an escalating fear factor. Secluded and peaceful. Also featured are : Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. The phone begins ringing, ringing, ringing.",1
Good film! I wasn't bored in the film at any point and I was even on the edge of my seat at one point.,1
"It's all about understanding her fear. However, it sticks to the original story line pretty well.",1
"I don't know maybe she thought that this could be her breakthrough role. This was just a pretty decent movie. Fear to terror when she has the calls traced. I found Camilla not that good. Girls just like tog et scared or scream. The day she arrives to babysit, she really has no idea what in the hell really awaits her. I would explore everything that is around. This was on its own level. But what I found funny was the size of the house.",1
All in all I would rate this movie a 9. They all SCREAMED like nuts and were so scared. But one thing : I AM SO NOT BABYSITTING PAST 9 : 00 PM EVER AGAIN1! I was recently at a sleepover birthday party with five other girls all my age ( eleven. ),1
"If you don't like odd, non - mainstream films, steer clear of this masterpiece. They are only concerned about accumulating and procreating.",1
I see in her some great potential to become a good actress. The phone rings. 24 % of all voters rated the movie with 1.,1
When A Stranger Calls is actually a pretty good movie. I had never saw the original and so when I watched this I thought it was unique.,1
its very good. with a great story. i totally want to buy this movie. I'm a future movie critic. lol.,1
"Well, no, there weren't big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls, but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen. It's definitely worth seeing. Many parts at the beginning reminded me of a corny, badly - written, badly - acted Lizzie McGuire episode. I don't watch very many'horror'movies, but one night I sat down and watched this with my cousins.",1
"overall, i enjoyed it and i was surprised how quickly it went. My only complaint, other than the ending, was the lack of character development. how did he get out to kill her friend? I don't know if it was because i was expecting a bomb or what, but i really enjoyed the movie. In fact the scenes where she is frightened are acted perfectly. And, finally, someone got the fire poker right.",1
""", etc.",1
I liked this movie. I watch a lot of movies ( working in a video store tends to help ) and this really isn't as bad as people seem to think.,1
"), I was excited to see this remake. Having seen the original when I was 13 ( and, yes, I was stupid enough to watch it while babysitting! No blood, no gore... just good psychological fun! < br / > < br / > All I can say is, I'm glad I'm too old to babysit! WINNER! < br / > < br / > Camilla Bell did a great job as Jill Johnson.",1
"Why? It's spooky, not bloody, It's creepy, not gory! It brought it back to the roots of the original Halloween. not perfect! It was nice to see a film come a long like this. It was a film made of mood, atmosphere, suspense!",1
There's A LOT of subtle humor. < br / > < br / > Split also filmed around Santa Cruz and San Francisco. The original plot is very easy to follow.,1
"But man alive folks, how much were you expecting from a movie about a babysitter being stalked? Cut them some slack!",1
This Stan Laurel comedy short is a cute little parody of the Valentino film BLOOD AND SAND.,1
1 & 2 collection.,1
< br / > < br / > This is best Stan Laurel solo work I've seen.,1
"Seeing Laurel without Hardy in a film seems strange, yet it's entertaining all the same. Dale Roloff And the bullfight climax is a gem, as even the bull takes a pratfall.",1
And kudos too for the movie to engage in dialogue based on the characters'native The mighty Yangtze River also makes an appearance.,1
"2 million people. When he tracks her down in Shanghai she is working at a library and resistant to Vincenzo's approach. The trip brings the travelers face to face with poverty, overcrowded housing, and children left to fend for themselves. We meet Liu's son ( Lin Wang ) at the home of her grandmother. < br / > < br / > As they slowly open up to each other, they expose each other's vulnerability and the film delves into their past and present life and how they arrived at their present situation. Vincenzo Buonovolonta is the Maintenance Manager at a steel mill in Italy that has been shut down and the blast furnace sold to China.",1
"He doesn't exactly endear himself to the Italian old management, or to the new Chinese owners. He takes the viewer into unknown territory. His next quest is getting to the woman that was the translator, Liu Hua. < br / > < br / > Sergio Castellitto is the sole reason for watching the film. < br / > < br / > Gianni Amelio's film is a sort of travelogue.",1
"Try to see it. """,1
"A priceless legacy to keep. She definitely deserved that award. Vincenzo ( Castellitto ), a technician of a steel factory, is one of us. Liu, the Chinese girl, is the key of the whole film. Their friendship is beautifully narrated, the way it grows step by step, dignified and formative, unique. Abandoned and exploited children, beehive - homes, backward areas is the OTHER china we ignore. Reality, nonetheless, is harsh.",1
"A wonderful movie with wonderful actors! So I saw this movie and I was fascinated! "" So only one star is missing! She's a translator from china who'missing her son.",1
"He is played by Sergio Castellitto, one of contemporary Italy's most versatile and talented actors. This is a wonderful new movie currently still showing in cinemas in my country. He warns them that not doing this might have very dangerous consequences.",1
"You don't bite the hands that feed you. These amateur musicians weren't all that bad players. Very enjoyable movie. Not common, but not unheard of either. Marshall was no saint himself.",1
< br / > < br / > Highly recommended if you can actually get to see it.,1
"Almost nobody gets rich. At the last minute, they hire a professional to take his place. My mom, who was a musician, LOVED it. Jazz musicians have to travel abroad to make a living.",1
He does not kidnap women and children! Winchester. Teddy Roosevelt : Certainly. Unconquered. It may respect us. Raisuli : Roosevelt. But always alone.,1
See it! Genuine and heart - warming.,1
I recommend wholeheartedly. What's not modest is the film's success.,1
This movie combines boozy sexually active teens and demons into one hell of a fun movie.,1
"Looney, huh? Horror fans should enjoy and dig in! Isn't this stuff great?",1
"Followed by two sequels. It is scary, gory and pretty atmospheric. Night of the Demons "" is a perfect horror film. Give this one a look.",1
Terrific! Some sequences really are creepy and the funeral house setting supplies Night of the Demons with an excellent tone. The ultimate highlight however is Linnea Quigley's trick with the disappearing lipstick!,1
For horror fans only!,1
This creaky old house makes for a great horror film location ; the fact that it used to be a funeral home only adds to this. Not that this is a problem ; but the Night of the Demons could have been a lot better had it fused these elements properly. Their only salvation lies on the other side of the underground stream... but finding the gate to the grounds isn't as easy as it sounds. < br / > < br / > The film's centrepiece is the Gothic mansion where the action takes place.,1
"Bloodthirsty highlights The loutish, profane, beer - guzzling, sex - happy dipstick dimwits hold a séance as a joke ( very bad idea,'cause the desolate old dive is naturally said to be haunted by demonic spirits ). < br / > < br / > However, Steve Johnson's marvelously gory and imaginative make - up effects are the true star of the show.",1
"Based on a true story, this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a film. 10 / 10 Bethany Cox One definite plus is how it was filmed. I saw this film at school and absolutely loved it. And I have to mention the music from Jerry Goldsmith, it was phenomenal. The direction is sensitively handled too.",1
I loved it!!! Will they survive the Night of the Demons.,1
"You all know it, it's still a lot of fun. Luckily, this is.",1
"< br / > < br / > Next, we see Linnea showing us her quigleys in the bathroom. Max isn't much help, leaving it to Judy to figure a way out. Actually, there is only one, but it multiplies.",1
"Overall, I would give it a 7 out of 10. A group of obnoxious teens go to a former funeral parlor for a Halloween party. The terrible acting and atrocious dialog almost ruins it though.",1
"Well, Angela and co. decide to throw a séance. That out of the way, it's still a lot of fun. The movie is anything but original, and really, it's not a good movie. The 80's is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun. So why?",1
Steve Johnson's make - up effects are awesome. This movie took me by surprise. And the scares are jolting. The opening credit sequence features nicely done animation. Equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films.,1
I love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie.,1
This movie has it all for horror fans!,1
The dialog and the special fx made this movie a classic. I got to meet a few of the actor's and they were cool.,1
But its 80's cheese and its got all the elements you need. Kudos to the filmmakers. It was random and I loved it. She seemed to have been taunting me for months. I must say. This is easily one of my FAVORITE movies to watch on Halloween. GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!,1
It is a monument to what filmmaking once was but is no more.,1
"Modern horror flicks have become almost completely dominated by CGI. I remember seeing this film in the theater and liking it. Lastly, if you like action horror flicks you will probably like this one a lot.",1
The sound track is awesome. Evil Dead has NOTHING on this film! I absolutely love this movie!,1
has to be good!,1
One of the eighties horror classics and worth a look!,1
"( you'll understand when you see it! ) Give it a chance tonight, just stay away from any old makeup! I give the gore a solid 9, and the Demons'one - liners are actually funny. It's definitely worth a rental at least.",1
This movie series though is far superior to that one!,1
"< br / > < br / > I give it, 8 out 10. decide to throw a Halloween party at a local former funeral parlor called "" Hull House "".",1
"Theresa Russell might seem too glamorous as Ma, but she has some very good moments.",1
< br / > < br / >,1
"It's a STORY based on some real people - that's all! Who knows? 8!! They sent her to the movies when they were "" working ""! I was given a DVD of Public Enemies and was expecting it to be the 2009 version but it wasn't - it was this!",1
"You can't watch this film for a history lesson. So why did I give it a 7 out of 10? And with a little internet research I realized I was of course right. The set pieces are great, reproducing a convincing 1930s era. < br / > < br / > Because it was damn entertaining. And if you like this, you'll love Serial Mom. And I appreciate the minimal use of swears for the period. The gunfights are fun to watch but there are some deeper themes that emerge between them.",1
The Portuguese are getting a high quality standards. I want more!,1
I also had a little impression that the director has been inspired by some Hitchcock work. A sick and twisted tale of coincidence and deceit. It is fantastic! This movie is a must see for everyone!,1
"The car crash ( this isn't spoilers, the film is too clever for THAT ) makes for a great scene, and apparently was done with cheap equipment. This time he's really doomed Or is he? ( US Studios take notice : you may spare dollar or two by hiding competent Portuguese directors! )",1
"Oh, yes! Did I like the film? """,1
"The ending is a bit unexpected, though, at the same time, somewhat expected. This is probably one of the best Portuguese movies I ever saw...",1
"Despite its ultra low budget, "" Sorte Nula "" is the most successful Portuguese film of 2004. 9 / It's very detailed and superbly advanced for a seemingly simple love - story - gone - bad thriller. It's creepy but hilarious at the same time. And I must say, a well deserved success. I feel one of the film's major attributes would have to be the environment that it establishes.",1
Yesterday I finally satisfied my curiosity and saw this movie.,1
The costumes and weaponry of the Berber were perfectly accurate as well. The portrayal of the Marines in this film is spot on. Millius is a genius.,1
My wife laughed at this. Let this one out. < br / > < br / > The funniest bit?,1
"As do I, expending energy defending that same cartoon. Not a nice cartoon, but sometimes life isn't nice.",1
"I viewed Linda, and it is a Top - Rate Movie! < br / > < br / > A Wonderful Movie! "" !",1
His portrayal is sensitive and touching. I don't agree with the previous comments.,1
Congratulations Miramax & Director Lisa Krueger!,1
I thoroughly enjoyed!,1
Why water down such a great storyline? The screenplay was average. The costumes / sets here was very good.,1
late. Some people actually believe marriage is forever.,1
"Of * course * that would never really happen. This is a truly great and beautiful movie. I can hear the cynics groaning. She reasons with him, convinces him to seek help, and gives him $ 30 as a start. The sad part is realizing we don't live there.",1
"I liked it, and my vote is seven. I believe it is an independent production.",1
"I stumbled onto it by chance and I had no recollection, not even an inkling, of this movie from promos or reviews or word of mouth. Okay, not that surprised, as American awards tend to go to women in'serious'roles, filled with angs And very cleverly too! I loved this film! < br / > < br / > Graham's performance as Joline is brilliant.",1
"< br / > < br One or two critics really liked it, but many viewed it as slight. I get the feeling that Lisa Krueger is easy to overlook. Or perhaps even a misreading. The film played for a week or two in major urban centers and vanished. Sociologically, she's a complete deviant.",1
"Truly, it is ourselves. Joline is like a wake - up call. This movie could be likened to "" comfort food "" for the soul. Give it a try - despite the trite looking DVD cover.",1
"It's quirky script and offbeat style is downright infectious. This is a very imaginative, quite humorous look at the marriage vow. but Jo discourages his attraction to her. She meets a gorgeous sculptor - neighbor ( Goran, can't spell his name! )",1
9 / 10 All actresses and actors give wonderful performances and the musical score is immaculate. On her trip she encounters a bountiful of interesting characters who unknowingly help her find her way.,1
"Her name is Joline, and this is her story. Who knows? Maybe it's because of that ` clay'she's made of.",1
My vote is eight. The action scenes are very realistic. Brian Keith is great as the American president.,1
I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece.,1
I voice with movie.,1
A must - see for everyone.,1
"I say to you. """,1
This movie is stunningly free from storytelling.,1
Fridrik Thor Fridriksson has proven that money isn't key to making a good movie but originality.,1
I would bet on this film to win best foreign film award next year all over the globe!,1
< br / > < br / > I really DO recommend to you.,1
"Well, this < br / > < br / > movie has that... and. Enjoy. I highly recommend this movie.",1
The movie does not start on the same place as the book starts. This movie I've seen many times.,1
"It is a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its emptiness, rage and solitude. Really everything is just great, even ( and not least ) the soundtrack with the magnificent Sigur Rós. < br / > < br / > Finally : When you've seen the movie watch it again. Why?",1
"< br / > < br / > I recommend this movie to all movie connoisseurs. It is one of the best movies that has ever come out of Iceland, if not out of Scandinavia.",1
"They say genius things! Why ask him what have he done? It is the best film i have seen in the last 5 years. Like the girlfriend of one of the patient. < br / > < < br / > < br / > Really, i'm still under impression of that film. But i'm sure, those of you, who have watched the movie, understand me. And the final scene! I mean Milos Forman only showed the material point of view of problem. There are no bad and good boys in the film.",1
It'really thought provoking and made me ponder a lot. < br / > < br / > I left the cinema feeling really sad.,1
"< br / > < br / > The film was made for a mere 23, 000 dollars.",1
The only thing keeping them going is the loan that Eddie's mother gave them and that they desperately want to pay back. Eddie becomes re - acquainted with Kitty Lewis ( Helene Costello ) a girl from his home town who has made good on Broadway. They soon do realise it and regret the day they left their small town. Poor Helene is best known for appearing in this pretty dreary film that bought a revolution to Hollywood!!,1
"And there are singing and dancing numbers! That was good money back in 1928. However, this film released in July 1928 is virtually unremembered for its place in film history. Lights of New York was the first all - talking feature film. The scenes in Hawk's nightclub are used as an opportunity to show off what films could never do before - musical numbers. < br / > < br / > The plot is quite simple.",1
3 million. No one expected this little film to gross an amazing $ 1. A couple of the actors muff their lines but then keep right on with the scene.,1
3 million. When Warner discovered this he ordered Foy to cut it back to the original short. But it's the Hawk himself who takes the bullet in a twist that will surprise few. Title cards are intercut which redundantly announce characters and locales.,1
She was great. He'wonderful!,1
it is a must see one.,1
GRADE :,1
A movie with great refinement and taste. Well worth experimenting with. Rental stores'staff! Wrong too.,1
A moving ending for any parent. ( I gave it 7. ),1
I loved it. I thought it was terrific.,1
"She looked the part of the gorgeous, rebellious hippie who wants to change the world though sometimes she comes off as a rebel without a cause. I will watch again. This is one of those movies Cameron did for the sake of acting and not for star billing.",1
The strong survive. That's what Phoebe realizes in the end.,1
"I found the character of Wolf not totally convincing. < br / > < br / > The acting of Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster was excellent. < br / > < br / Their mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents. The story was quite unique and at times had a surreal quality. It seemed like I never even blinked. Phoebe learns more and more about this as the movie progresses. However, those were my only "" complaints. """,1
"It's a great yarn, with a whiff of political correctness. It is visually eloquent, highly evocative. Don't mess with the Corps, Abdul. Noblesse oblige, by way of Von Clausewitz? The exciting story is based on a few historical facts. A Marine detachment storms the Bashaw's palace, putting out the fires of competing hegemonies with gasoline.",1
"Faith has killed herself. Cameron Diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly. When we This story was familiar ground for me. It is 1969. Phoebe can't let it go. Both Phoebe and Gail are overwhelmed by this news and, although saddened, Gail mourns. Jordana Brewster slid easily into the role of the older Phoebe. Although angry, Phoebe realizes in the end how human and fragile Faith really was.",1
The ending is truly moving. < br / > < br / > So there's nudity but it's minimal. Great movie.,1
"It is a blurred balance, and this film captures this balance.",1
"9 out of 10. I can't recall ever seeing more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in lovemaking in a film! The plot of this film is not complicated. A very attractive young girl goes to Europe in search of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier.",1
Why did she < br / > < br / > commit suicide? An < br / > < br / > imaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time well < br / > < br / > spent.,1
"It really struck a chord with me. Well done by all. At the very least, certainly I could see it again and again. The locales were absolutely gorgeous. I would highly recommend this one. Their acting superb by far. It's hard to say that about any film.",1
She is a stunning beauty with what seems to be a naturalness for acting. < br / > < br / > Phoebe can't forget Faith.,1
"He is reluctant but decides to travel with her. It seems weird that Wolf would engage in a romance with his dead girlfriends sister. Gee, thanks a lot Wolf! She'very good here and I hope better roles come her way.",1
Make sure you see.,1
"solid 8 / 10. This is proof that Hollywood can "" make'em like they used to "" when it really wants to.",1
"Bill Hicks was honest, beyond that he was the funniest of them all. I'll put this as plainly as possible for those of you unaware of Bill Hicks'legacy. It's everything that Bill Hicks spoke against. But the harsh truth is clear as day : nobody has stepped up to claim his mantle. His star will continue to shine long after so many lesser lights have blew out.",1
"I had already seen "" Revelations "" but the comedy clips were still rereshing. < br / > < br / > I rated it a ten.",1
genius.,1
"The numbers don't lie, 109 people have voted for this film. Let's make sure nothing is too provocative, nothing will be too interesting And the result? 11 years after his death, 109 people at IMDb can say something about the film. And then the second film is a complete performance. After you've seen them both, I hope you understand why more people should be listening to Bill Hicks.",1
So I decided to watch it one more time. But they had clothes and cars with a design typical for the 1950's. Crazy six is pendling between red and the blue color. When I first watched this movie I thought it was a very strange movie. Albert Puyn creates an sci - fi / action movie with a politicial depth. I think that it means that the movie's real time is not specified. Mao had the dog in the beginning but the cop took it in the end.,1
Oh my GOD! I believe she is the greatest of all time.,1
But everyone did fine job. This is a very Freudian psycho - thriller. Carax has a minimalist style. There is a lot going on between the lines in this film. That is really my favorite kind of filmmaking. I thought the cult stuff was great.,1
Seriously. Never have I been so angry at a main character.,1
"After such a movie you can't do another one in the same point of view. So Leos Carax has to changed, and he did.",1
"Frankly, I expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent French movie. I was wrong. Pola X is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience.",1
"< br / > < br / > And Isabelle, who is she really??",1
"It's best I've seen all year. You will, I hope, be rewarded in the same way that I was. It will leave you with 1, 000 thoughts, each of them at once troublesome and thrilling. Pola X is a beautiful adaption of Herman Melville's'Pierre ; or, the Ambiguities '.",1
"This movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end. Consequently, if you are not into tragedies, this is not your movie. Overall I give this movie a 7. If these sorts of things don't impress you, skip it.",1
"This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently. So many people hated this film! But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.",1
"< br / > < br / > And no. I've just seen it... and liked it. < br / > < br / > The film needs some patience, yes.",1
"I hope more people discover this tantalizing film. which, of course, he wasn't. His version of a Victorian romance was a twisted, cynical one, perhaps, but brilliant in its synthesis. The alternate title : "" The ambiguities "" is quite appropriate. Newspapers even published headlines like : "" Melville Insane! "" As he searches for happiness, he becomes more and more miserable.",1
Milton Shaw Thank you for your attention.,1
"The musical score is also remarkable an fits accordingly. Brian Keith plays one of his best roles ever as American president Teddy Roosevelt. Give it chance, you won't regret it.",1
"< br / > < br / > The "" Z "" Channel showed this film as part of "" Harvey Keitel "" retrospective. It's a nice little film. < br / > < br / > If you can find this uncut... it's worth a look.",1
"In fact, it's uncanny.",1
"The film is fast paced, funny and worth seeing. Too bad he is virtually forgotten today. His "" camera tricks "" weren't so much tricky but annoying and stupid.",1
"The writing was also very strong. If you ask me, it was a good show.",1
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.,1
"After the success of "" Muppet Babies "" Warner Brothers chalked up "" Tiny Toons "". Hampton was an even more shy version of Porky Pig, and he had the thankless job of playing Porky to Plucky's Daffy. Shirley, blond duck gal, was a new age valley girl type whom Plucky would go in and out of phases of mocking or vying for her affections. Furball was the silent Sylvester and Sweety was the pink Tweetie bird.",1
"I found the main two bunnies annoying, but Hamton & Plucky were always amusing. Please release those! OK, the show was a little uneven, but I still loved it.",1
"1904. As President Roosevelt says, "" America is like a grizzly bear "" - fierce, strong, but a little blind and reckless at times. It's not really an "" epic "" film in the strictest sense, but it's one of the best pure action movies ever made.",1
You can say this exactly for Tiny Toons as well. The old Looney Tunes made a lot of social commentary and parody. It's now 2005 and 15 + years since this cartoon first aired. The comedy was surreal and wacky.,1
"There's no stopping Amenabar... < br / > < br / > Buen trabajo, Alejandro!",1
It's breathtaking. Javier Bardem performs the role of his life. < br / > < br / > This movie is MUST. Personally I knew the full story and even the end of it.,1
"I thought "" he's got it! Convincing, touching, emotional, brilliant. I watched "" Mar Adentro "" last night. He didn't. This is an actor. ).",1
"It is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice clothed in love, poetry, and friendship. "" I have wrestled with death.",1
"That the child wants to die. "" Once again Almenábar has provided us with a top quality film. < br / > < br / > Excellent writing, acting, directing, cinematography, music - 10 / 10. Most poignant was Ramon's father, when he said, despondent, "" There's only one thing worse than losing a child.",1
"Well, no doubt the scene is comic, but that doesn't mean the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. Most obvious of those are the family. Since many other users have already explained and commented the storyline, I won't do it. ) For instance, Ramón's sister - in - law never talks for or against euthanasia.",1
"I liked the song,'Negra sombra'('Dark Shadow ), by Luz Casal with music of Carlos Núñez. 'The Sea Within'deserves all the awards.",1
Think Ramón Sampedro addressed this in the movie as well. He is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics. It is he who wants to die. I would think not.,1
"Instead, the Rasuadli stated that the Europeans had guns on wheels that make the ground shake. < br / > < br / > The movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the Germans and the Americans. The German Mauser was one of the world's finest rifles. I didn't like it when they made the Rasuldai feel stupid that there was no word for artillery in the Moorican vocabulary.",1
It's a soap - opera drawing upon an applied ethics idea.,1
"And yet the achievement is in the film's effectiveness as a dramatic piece ; as a recollection of a true story and I guess as an argument as to why people should have the right to die if they so wish to. But the film isn't a political statement and perhaps thankfully it shies away from too many scenes of debate although it does include one for the sake of argument anyway. < br / > < br / > Even if you do have a strong policy, either pro or anti - euthanasia, you may find yourself hoping Ramón gets what he wants at the end of it all anyway.",1
The problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it. These choices make Sampredo into a calculated figure no matter how charming Bardem portrays him. Now I'm not here to say anything about the right for or against euthanasia. Bardem just does what he does well... and that's it. Certainly Javier Bardem is an actor that brings something extra to each film he makes.,1
Not too long has time passed and Julia begins to investigate her charge'past discovering many letters hidden away by his family.,1
"< br / > < br / > But as I keep saying ( to deaf ears? He does not focus on societal debates. You're supposed to be rating the film, as a film. As the film begins, he has been a quadriplegic for 26 years.",1
"Judges had denied several times his petitions of active euthanasia. There's a trap in this kind of pictures : you have to differentiate between the movie itself and the moral concepts. < br / > < br / > - Facts ( II ) : "" Mar adentro "" becomes THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR in Spain. This is ( the actors selection ) the strong point in Amenábar's movie. A star is born.",1
"Half way through the movie I started crying and it didn't stop until the credits rolled. Consider this : he has to carry this movie with only his face! The supporting cast was terrific! I give it a 9 / 10, and in my opinion it is by far the Best Film of year so far.",1
"It most likely got railroaded into the same category as Million Dollar Baby without its protesters having even seen it, an incredibly common phenomenon. It is guilty of a couple of crimes, though, and I'd still understand why disability groups could have a problem with it. First and foremost, there's the protagonist's meeting with a paraplegic bishop. Both advocates for the disabled and ( unfortunately for the disability advocates ) conservative pro - life groups protested both films, and their Oscar nominations. The nominations also came during the entire Terry Schiavo debacle, just to put it all in some historical perspective. The film does give time to many different sides of the argument. I don't look kindly on the way he's depicted. The film is, honestly, pretty dumb and uncomplex.",1
THE SEA INSIDE a film by Alejandro Amenabar. That's for the actors a huge challenge that must construct their whole performances with their eyes and the eyes don't lie.,1
"Unfortunately, neither the movie nor the DVD gives this important information. The dialogs lines are very solid and intelligent. Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain in the present days. Their relationship changes the behavior and viewpoint of life of Rosa and Julia.",1
Especially large scale end battle does not disappoint. < br / > < br / > It isn't until halve way through that the movie fully gets on steam. < br / > < br / > It's interesting to note that the story of the movie is based on true events. Seem that John Milius is just a big admirer of him. It doesn't at all times make the movie feel connected and a bit disjointed. I wish the entire movie was like this.,1
"Suddenly they must leave everything aside to take care of him at home. < br / > < br / > Mr. Amenabar tells the story from Ramon's point of view. < br / > < br / > Ramon's family is shattered by the experience. Anyone doubting it, should have a look at his latest film "" The Sea Inside "". In a second, Ramon goes from a vibrant young man into a vegetable! There is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part. < br / > < br / > Ramon Sampedro is a man confined to bed.",1
"Oh my friends. Then I watched the movie. You can feel it, you can breathe it in the skin of every character. And this is what the movie is about : love.",1
10 / 10 The year's best film in all senses.,1
Six stars out of five. His screen - presence has such a force that you forget that this is fiction.,1
"< br / > < br / > The problem, of course, is that Sampedro isn't sick in the normal sense. Death with Dignity "" is their watchword. Gene ( Clara Segura ) is a sensitive activist who enlists the A nice performance by Duenas.",1
The great Javier Bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as Ramon. Greetings again from the darkness.,1
"We are constantly encouraged to see the hope and the beauty of life lived with love. As the film progresses, we may gradually be encouraged to understand Ramon's reasoning but we are never reconciled to his decision. < br / > < br / > I don't remember a film which moved me and provoked me as much as this.",1
'Condenado a vivir'( 2001 ) ( TV ) was the first version of this man's life on which I have already commented. Sampedro was an articulate and intelligent man who after a diving accident off the rocks of the Galician coast as a young man was condemned to live the next 27 years in bed.,1
I concur with what mallicka. b has said.,1
And nearly no dancing at all. < br / > < br / > Aishwarya Rai is good - looking.,1
< br / > < br / > Here'hoping that he will again find his way.,1
She sees him as a child who is glorifying himself in his lust - control but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up? The mother in her still couldn't find the strength to destroy his myth. Both the wives find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband. What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms?,1
'Chokh bali'is a perfect example.,1
Its very tough to portray a Tagore novel along cinematographic lines.,1
"No. Directed by Rituparno Ghosh { who later goes on to direct her in the equally stellar'Raincoat'}, Prasenjit Chatterjee { Devdas in Bengali } costars.",1
Aishwarya was easily at her best.,1
I concur with what mallicka. 'Raincoat was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. b has said.,1
Yet another classic from Rabindranath Tagore. The script also supports the story very well. Aishwarya's acting : par excellence. I cannot say that is long.,1
"Soon, her friendship with Ashalata flourishes. Chokher Bali A passion play. < br / > < br / > Mahindra chooses a naive Ashalata ( Raima Sen ) over Binodini and marries her. But, soon, she unmasks her real face.",1
"The director, Rituparno Ghosh, was there to give a short introduction and answer questions afterwards. First, the original Bengali version was 20 + minutes longer. I think her interpretation was valid, although there could certainly be other ways to do it. Next, there was a segment where Binodini was writing a poem - - a sign of her independence, etc. Possible, maybe ; realistic, I'm not so sure. Chokher Bali was shown at the ( Washington ) DC Filmfest April 15, 2005. So what was left out? I know a fair amount of Indian history, Hindu religion, etc., but the level of detail here was far beyond me. < br / > < br / > As always, I think Aishwarya did a fantastic job.",1
So far I haven´t met anyone as impressed and pleased by it as I am!!! It´s a movie that shows everything and more! !,1
"So much for that. What do you think HE thinks? You know Hollywood. < br / > < br / > This movie is based on a true story - - like Jesse James was a banker. This is one great, sweeping, movie you will remember for a long time. The score is as sweeping and exotic as the images.",1
finally i´m really sorry for my bad english - i´m not a studied person!! !,1
"Religion won't save you, nor will mother nature or your own family. The dreams of Karim Hussain are to be feared. The film's opening meditation on madness is both well written and profound. Hussain offers depictions of lusty pagan fertility and writhing mushroom madness.",1
When you have waited years to see a film that you have heard on the grape vine about obviously your expectations are high right? f * * k yeah!,1
"I have read quite a lot about it, and I unfortunately missed it at the Stockholm Film Festival. But that is just my opinion. They are a great inspiration as I soon embark on my own short film production.",1
"Very short but this one kind of blows the film's momentum. Some will call it trash, some will call it brilliant. Karim Hussain's masterpiece of art / gore - - this cat is definitely a talent to look out for. This is one of those "" must be seen to be believed "" type things. cking bloody holes in a field and whatnot. ).",1
"give it a try. wrong. And this was damn right, without a doubt, unique. Visually I haven't seen anything like it. The gore effects in this one were great. The brother is crazy and the sister is somewhat of a whore. Like I said above, it is an artsy film. < br / > < br / > The movie isn't easy to describe or even discuss. The second segment is my favorite. The cinematography and lighting were done very well.",1
"I've got no idea what the point is, but it certainly makes for visceral viewing. Well, it's safe to say that Subconscious Cruelty is one weird film!",1
"Yuck and Ouch! The branches bleed when broken. I've never been more disturbed in my life by what I witnessed. The third part is my absolute favorite. Subconscious Cruelty "" has to be one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. "" In this segment people have sex with the earth. It deals with a man'sexual obsession with his pregnant sister. It reminds me of "" Begotten "" and Jame's Broughton's 1972 short film "" Dreamwood "".",1
"Watching "" Subconscious Cruelty "" is a real event, and not something the viewer will easily forget. And a note to gorehounds, this is must - have. Looks like a movie from the minds of Lynch ( specifically ERASERHEAD ), Buttgereit, and even a little of "" Begotten "". And that music still amazes me, I have to try and find the soundtrack if is available.",1
I'm among the ones who liked it very much for several different reasons. Obviously from the reviews on this board - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY has divided those that have seen it.,1
My little 3 year old cousins even sit down and watched it. I like The Wind and the Lion very much. It was a good movie.,1
"Check it out. There is also a Jesus statue with a projection of awastika on it. "" The birthing scene is particularly nasty and not easily forgotten. The film mixes many wonderful visuals with plenty of sleaze and gore.",1
Her prayers for her missing son moved me to tears.,1
"Simply viewing the film makes manifest this film's ( or DVD ) artistic value. This cinematic version also strikes an exceptionally deep - rooted nerve that is, I maintain, both specifically ethnic, yet also generally universal. < br / > < br / > Briefly,. < br / > < br / > Perez'film, originally made as a highly - rated American Playhouse PBS production has taken some time to be released in DVD. The film, and now DVD, however, remains, so far as I know, the only cinematic adaptation of any Chicano novel and clearly is a tribute to Earth's incredible staying power.",1
The acting was fantastic.,1
See all 400 minutes of it if you can.,1
Rating : / 10,1
"That, at least, he can be a little happy with his own dreams. A film of drug dealers? Did you see the news? I guess there must be reasons. So, parents, don't underestimate your kids ; they know what they want. What do you want for them?",1
The kids are very cool too. B. J. is pretty funny. Barney is definitely super DE duper.,1
"In short, Barney may be annoying to some people and I completely understand why, but cut him some slack. Maybe less so than in the early 90's where Barney was the Hannah Montana of the time, but he's still a classic. Be thankful some one ( a costumed dinosaur, but still ) is there to comfort kids and let them be kids simply. I can understand how Barney can be annoying to some, but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous. I personally find this show to be very underrated period.",1
It's Barney for God's sake. Of course not.,1
< br / > < br / > And then came Barney. But here's the thing. I know I did. Kids? He entertains. I know what keeps Barney on the air. They LOVE this show.,1
What 2 or 3 year old actually gets all that anyways its all about the colors and the singing.,1
"So stop hating. But I watched it, and I'm top of my class. Keep it to yourself. If you don't like it, fine. And Barney helps that. Barney helps encourage that. Kids need a place to escape to express themselves. Where imagination lives on. This show is great. Barney does this to us.",1
< br / > < br / > i haven't gotten any smarter but i enjoyed it. yes barney is nonsense now but when i was a kid it made perfect sense.,1
This is one of Charley Chase'better efforts. * * * of 4 stars. What a dandy it is!,1
"In the end, they both feel pretty foolish! But what about the poor spouses supposedly at home? You really have to see it to believe it. Okay. But, they both sneak back home - - not wanting their spouses to know!",1
"( * * * Minor spoilers * * * ) < br / > < br / > If there's something in the world of silent clowns that puzzles me, it is that Charley Chase never got his well deserved "" break through "" in the movies. < br / > < br / > Mr. Moose isn't extraordinary handsome, and Mrs. Moose is hardly a "" classic beauty ; "" he possesses truly biggest front teeth of any human being on the planet, and she has a remarkably large nose. Both of them takes plastic surgery without the other's knowledge, and when they meet by accident just a little later, he doesn't recognize his wife and she doesn't recognize her husband. A number of hilarious misunderstandings begin, with many clever gags all the way through. Oh well, maybe it isn't that strange, really, inasmuch as he never starred in any full - length features. But when I think of it, such an explanation makes it all only more mysterious - - because why the heck didn't Chase get any offers to play the leading lead in features? I don't think I'll reveal anything further, to make the viewing more enjoyable for you.",1
"From start to finish, this 1926 classic two reeler from the Hal Roach Studios seems to sum up what was fun about the 20's. Check out this little gem of a film.",1
"Multiple stretches is more like it. Henry, an estimable player in her own Soon we meet buck - toothed Charley Moose and his wife Vivien, who has an enormous nose. They each rush home excitedly, enter separately and are at first unaware of each other's presence.",1
That was not wholly tongue in cheek.,1
"Dead Man Walking is very cleanly done, with good performances all round, and a good script. I have just seen this broadcast on Channel 4. If you don't take religion seriously then you probably won't see much in this film. In fact it's hard to fault it artistically.",1
This movie has two new features in relation to the message conveyed by other equally good movies about death penalty and executions.,1
"He nails the role, doesn't glamourize his actions while doing so. < br / > < br / > The supporting cast was also top - notch.",1
This one is about the murderer. There have been many films about crime victims.,1
"< br / > < br / > I read the User Comments and they react as if Matthew was real. She has my respect - she manages to find that balance - she isn't supporting a killer, she is guiding them to accepting what they did. If they didn't feel some kind of remorse, they wouldn't be asking for spiritual guidance.",1
!,1
"< br / > < br / > Everyone praises the acting, directing and the music but since this has been said so many times the I will not repeat it all again. < br / > < br / > This is one of the few movies that really gives you the choice, that does not shy away with a simple path by making convicted either bad or innocent. And this is a very rare thing in American films. But I have even seen opponents turn into supporters. There is no lesson here you need to find one yourself. < br / > < br / > And I think that is completely right.",1
Fun to watch? You bet. Mindless story?,1
This is not a film for entertainment.,1
What about the actors?,1
Go and see..... Tim Robbins makes a wonderful film.,1
they are simply magnificent.,1
"It tells the story with little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity. It doesn't matter whether you're for or against the death penalty ( or even have no opinion ), this movie will have you thinking about the issues for sure. You get drawn into this film and become a participant, and there's character for just about everyone to identify with. I have it on DVD, and every time I watch it ( not often, it's never an easy film to watch ) I'm more impressed by what Tim Robbins and the entire cast did here. 10 / 10.",1
"One word for Tim - BRAVO. And by the time she got this oscar, she'd been in the industry for some 25 years. Susan Sarandon is, for lack of a better word, incredible. However, both sides of the death - penalty debate are given even weight.",1
She might have had doubt in her actual role.,1
Very true and faithful to the book.,1
The acting was unsurpassed. It is must see.,1
"The intrigues get far beyond one brigand's demand for ransom. But it is an enjoyable film and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Never mind that though, his predicament was serviceable enough at the time. The incident comes during 1904 as Theodore Roosevelt runs for election to the presidency in his own right. < br / > < br / > The Wind and Lion is hardly history.",1
"Suffice it to say : This is the best film I've ever seen. So now I get it : It's all political. For example, take the IMDb Top 250. < br / > < br / > Mr. Robbins, your movie's issue split people's opinions. You're pro death penalty - you don't like ( and therefore don't want to hear ) what film has to say. And I think I've seen a lot.",1
It describes reality. The reality is the best argument against the death penalty. I watched it twice.,1
She deserved the award.,1
"Dead Man Walking "" is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.",1
"Thank you, Tim Robbins!",1
And it is what this film is actually all about : Forgiveness.,1
"I can't recommend this film enough, 9 / 10. Even more amazing, Robbins doesn't patronize.",1
There'not one false note in the film.,1
A whisper from the ghost of Empire... Honor.,1
"With these, the audience is able to somewhat connect mentally with the band. This superfluity is party made up for by printing lyrics for some of the songs. Overall, a good movie that I'm glad I saw. Really, I was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture. I'll check out the follow - ups if I ever get a chance. I don't know why all the lyrics were not printed.",1
< br / > < br / > The One and the Only!,1
Truly worth seeing.,1
P. S. The follow - up Decline Pt. Great film! Where is that today? Unmatched.,1
Great movie for fans of punk rock.,1
This is teen angst at it's best folks. And of coarse a great movie. I own both of these on VHS. She is a true underground film maker and I love her stuff. It was worth the wait. I laughed when I saw this. I thought the first name was pronounced like envelope. Much better than 1991 : The Year Punk Broke.,1
I didn't see too many people who were into that at all. I LOVE this film.,1
"There is also a lot of humor in the interplay among the main and supporting characters. Brian Keith ( very good as TR ) says, "" Pedecaris alive or the Raisuli dead! "" This is an adventure movie with Arabs, Germans and the USMC all coming to grips at one point or another.",1

"No internet, crappy jobs, and all out hostility collide in this genre. For new kids who haven't heard of these bands or are just starting one themselves this movie is a true lesson in how to rock. The decline series is amazing and director PS can't get enough credit for making these movies. The film starts out with a blistering collection of clips played over music from the band X. How about Black Flag renting their apartment / rehearsal space for 16 dollars a month! All the band performances ( and there are many ) are awesome, especially FEAR who never cease to amaze me.",1
After I saw this movie that completely changed. Look out for the interviews with the young punk kids. Highly recommended.,1
"Unfortunate as this is, blame for it rests solely with those who promote, believe in or feel comfortable with stereotypes - Not the film - makers. Don't blame the messenger. < br / > < br / > Although I didn't grow up in California, the American punk scene was the first music scene I ever truly lived in. If all this rings true - read on - you are likely to find some consonance with at least part of this review.",1
P. S. The follow - up Decline Pt. Great film! Where is that today? Unmatched.,1
"To some, the bands read like a who's who of now legendary American punk ; Black Flag, X, Circle Jerks, Germs, Fear.",1
"It really is a great illumination of the burgeoning punk scene in LA in 1980. Whew! These guys just didn't care. The band interviews reveal an honest approach to the music that really doesn't exist anymore. But also it turns the camera's POV into that of tourist, passing through this alien world.",1
"A few of them almost come off as normal, some don't, but they're only offensive to those who aren't too open to things. A performer like that would probably scare Steve Miller and Jackson Browne out of their skins. For the fan, such as myself, there are precious interviews with some of the quasi - legends of LA's punk - scum, some dead, some still living and still hard - working in the scene.",1
"Some plot inconsistencies, clichés and hollow momentspoil the overall effect.",1
As a viewer you became as confused and misdirected as she was. What a day! Wow.,1
"Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age. This is high adventure at its best.",1
This movie was totally different.,1
"Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. He's here to reclaim the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain. The poem is much in evidence, but the theme - - it gets a little lost. Benes is a super - nice guy, but no fool.",1
"She has a louse of a husband, but they have great sex. He's real low class socially handicapped wretch. He is a real horror show. ( no spoiler! ) A poor girl is wooed by a prince. She deserves more. These characters have flaws, some seemed driven by class, some by innate character.",1
This was an excellent movie! !,1
Marcela works and Jarda runs a chop shop out of the garage they live next to. 0 out of 10 and recommend it.,1
With many up and coming and aging Australian actors Crackerjack is a hidden gem. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy co - star. Mick Molloy plays a scammer who has been scoring free parking spaces at Cityside.,1
"Jack buying all the raffle tickets to win the meat tray. Or when Jack goes home and lays down on the couch and cracks a beer, "" bowls is hard work "" cracked me up. Crackerjack is a funny movie, everyone at the bowlo has seen it and all say the same.",1
It really is a must see.,1
"Considering the appalling track record of Mick Molloy since going out on his own, I had rather low expectations of Crackerjack. 7. Even the promotional posters for the movie had me nervous.",1
"< br / > < br / > Fire is a brilliantly directed story of second option, which women choose for themselves, no sacrifice, not to serve anybody else, rather a decision for their own good.",1
"While not for everyone, Crackerjack is a delight to watch, with tongue planted firmly in cheek.",1
If you're wondering which Aussie Rules team Mick supports check out the flag on his workstation. Why? Her own material is a lot wittier. Interesting character though. I was reticent to see this flick before reading the external reviews and user comments posted here. Bowls reporter on a local rag. < br / > < br / > Sensibly Mick has restrained his natural comedic exuberance in this surprisingly watchable movie. And secondly because good Aussie comedy films are sadly as rare as the Tassie Tiger.,1
Awesome flick!,1
There is low level coarse language. This is quite a clever little movie. It is well above Mick Molloys usual gutter humor. The Club is in dire financial straits and calls on Jack to help.,1
Crackerjack is a simple but feelgood movie where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sides. < br / > < br / > I'm sure that those who enjoyed The Castle and The Dish would also enjoy this movie. < br / > < br / > John Clarke's dour role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest but he gives solid performance.,1
"WORTH IT FOR : If not for Mick Molloy's work, then for Judith Lucy. This is the best Australian comedy I've seen in a long time. I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed. It's just good laughs at genuine 1972 prices. Go see it and learn the joys of Lawn Bowls!",1
"All in all, a witty, feel - good movie. 7 / 10. As a fan of his, I was used to a different kind of humour than displayed here. He wisely opted with a more subtle, broad style of comedy in Crackerjack, rather than his usual low brow, in - your - face ramblings. A familiar, and successful formula, that is handled well. It is, at times, inconsistent and un - even, but a decent script works past that, and makes for some entertaining viewing. I was very impressed with the latest production from Mick Molloy.",1
"Kick back, each your popcorn, and watchterling silver cinema action. It's just too bad that Hollywood does not make enough films like this one. Sharky's Machine is easily one of Burt Reynolds best efforts. Trust me, Atlanta has not changed. It also stands as one of the best contemporary crime dramas. It was even featured on That's Incredible, ABC's reality show of the period.",1
Sharky's Machine is a crime drama set in early 80's Atlanta.,1
This was Rachel Ward's first USA feature film.,1
"Isn't there a SWAT team? And at the end, what happened to all the police that run into the building with our heroes? < br / > < br / > Why would Burt Reynolds confront the crime boss with his big secret? he is actually a pretty good director. It is a shame that the climax is a typical shoot - em - up. Burt Reynolds directed this action movie and ( surprise! ) Sure it makes the guy sweat, but it causes many more cops to be killed.",1
If you don't like Burt you may still like this.,1
"< br / > < br / > The story is pure Detective procedure / actioner. His new digs offers him the chance to meet many equally upstanding officers who are doing the dirty jobs no one else wants. Sharky a narcotics detective mismanages up a bust of a drug dealer, causing killing of some innocent bystanders, and gets demoted, literally transferred downstairs to vice, to deal with perverts, and other m misdemeanors that'upstanding'cops consider latrine duty.

"Stick features another great Dar Robinson stunt. Very cool stuff. 44 magnum on his way down. PLEASE remake this classic film! Without a doubt, the best Burt Reynolds film ever!",1
The film also a great soundtrack too. Henry Silva is the bad guy and he always does a good job at that.,1
"al, many of whom get the best roles of their careers and run with it.",1
And they meet others as well. A nice little gem of a comedy. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of in - laws who take a cruise together.,1
"The West Coast got "" Dirty "" Harry Callahan, the East Coast got Sharky. It was his GROUP of fellow cops. Well I knew who played Sharky, I wonder what his machine was. Rating 4 out of stars. That was the BOMB! Great just great!",1
"This is Burt Reynolds'"" Citizen Kane "". It seemed to me that he put everything he had into it. Tragically nothing else he was ever involved in came close to approaching "" Sharkey's Machine "". It is a movie that is in love with movies.",1
"One of the star's better films from his glory days, it's no classic but it makes for more than efficient Saturday night special.",1
Realistically portrayed I believe ). The result is a great film noir.,1
"Henry Silva is truly icy as a hit - man. Sharky winds up in a real cesspool of crime. John Woo's "" The Killer "" replicates this scene. Billy blasts a hole the size of a twelve inch pizza in door of Dominoe's apartment and kills her. During the melee, an innocent bystander dies. ) in the basement. Not a bad performance in the movie and Reynolds does an outstanding job of directing it. During the surveillance, he has grown fond of Dominoe to the point that he becomes hopelessly infatuated with her.",1
It was on one night and I thought oh well why not. The music soundtrack on the other hand is hit or miss. < br / > < br / > Sgt.,1
"Busting hookers johns and perverts Sgt. Sharky, and his tough and well oiled "" Sharky's Machine "" Let.",1
"That's how Burt Reynolds describes this film, which happens to be his best ever. In the novel by William Diehl, the story is more complex because the guy's running for president. Check it out. Reynolds doesn't do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films. This movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever.",1
"It was reported in fact that Clint Eastwood was offered this film. < br / > < br / > The prestige is hardly as good as the narcotics beat, but it does have its fringe benefits. One night after a roundup of working girls where one of their books falls into their hands, the guys ask for surveillance on Rachel Ward's place. Why Laura? You'll have to see Sharky's Machine for that answer.",1
"It suffers only from some slow stretches ; Burt perhaps tried to make it more "" arty "" than it should have been.",1
< br / > < br / > Enjoy! ( Where'd she go? ) It might be Reynold's best film ever. WOW!,1
S.. Or else The Day The Earth Stood Sill.,1
See this just to watch Andy. They don't have the word lie in their vabularies. I always loved that scratchy voiced guy in all those westerns.,1
"The screenplay, directing and acting was also good.",1
"I don't much like Valentine'Day but it gave me an excuse to watch this movie again, and I'm glad of it. 6 rating here on IMDb, and dismissed by many critics as "" gooey slush "" ). Yet it seems to have fallen out of favour slightly ( Only a 6.",1

I think the heroine overshadowed hero. It was a very sweet ill fated love affair.,1
"His love for Jones, an oriental doctor, was endearing and so memorable to watch. < br / > < br / > Love is a many splendored thing.",1
This film works for me. A warmly felt experience! This film always hits me hard emotionally at the end.,1
"Still, I enjoyed it. bathing suit, Jones looks ridiculously gorgeous here.",1
"Some may consider sentimental romances passé, but, for those who enjoy classic Hollywood love stories, this is shining example. William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. The ending is a real tear - jerker.",1
The story of two people from different cultures falling in love.,1
"The film is unarguably physically busy, interesting and often beautiful also. The script by John Patrick followed Han's exquisite novel closely ; the direction by Henry King was solid as always. Age cannot tarnish the beauty of this East - west love story for me.",1
"The genre often provided roles for actresses older than the heroines of standard romances. As was sometimes the case, European colonialism was made the whipping - boy for some of America's own failings. Han Suyin was a real person and a well - known author of the period ; in reality she tended to support Mao's Communist regime, but here she is shown as firmly anti - Communist.",1
In this film even second tier actors shine. It is also obvious that they enjoyed making this film. Anyone who has known professional hosts in real life will immediately recognize the type he is playing. He nails the type perfectly.,1
You can only enjoy this film and watch it again.,1
"8 / Directed by a veteran Hollywood director Henry King who began his career still in 1915, Love is a Many Splendored Thing was one of his last great films. Don't miss that many splendored film.",1
I also have the book A Many Splendo Thing by Han Suyin. I just left the room to be on my own.,1
"What a stunning, under - rated actress she was. She's desiring AND desirable.",1
'nuff said. Now go watch! And it's incredible.,1
"The writing is top - notch, as is the acting. The more I see it, the more I appreciate it.",1
"It also will provide a continuing piece of nostalgia for Lemmon and Matthau, as well as the others in the cast. 8 / 2008. But isn't almost everyone?",1
He is soo hot!,1
Well locate this little sleeper.,1
"I really enjoyed it. I mean, I don't care for stupid "" stoner comedies. """,1

( and we were not even baked! ) < br / > < br / > Definite worth watching.,1
Which adds to the comedy. I felt my self wishing they would. - My advice have joint ready ; kick back and enjoy! Everyone involved in this film should get a big thumbs up.,1
"Brent Spiner proves that "" Data "" from Star Trek Next Geeration is not the only good character he can play. He was an enormous talent.",1
"Second off, the story was quite good also. First off, the cast is superb.",1
"While movie had several faults and a slow beginning, it turned out to be worthwhile. 7 / 10 stars.",1
The writing is hilarious. The effects are a hoot. This ranks as my favorite movie of all time.,1
"Well, maybe 15 for DVD, but you'll be real happy you did. There's a reason George Lucas calls this his favorite parody. Talk about your classics!",1
< br / > < br / > Fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid. Hardware Wars was the first in a long line of SW spoofs which form their own subgenre these days. I hate to describe it too much - it's so short that the premise is just about the whole thing.,1
"< br / > < br / > Now, the DVD - wow! For those of you that have ( shame! ) Anyway, this is great. You get the point, I'm sure.",1
"Relax, kid.",1
"This REALLY works with an audience! A definite 10! She looks at the camera, gives a grim smile and nods. That made it even funnier!",1
"Unknown to them, Matthau has no money either. The widower Lemmon falls for Gloria De Haven, looking lovelier than ever. This film is just another example of this. Matthau falls for Dyan Cannon, on board with her fellow gold - digging mother, the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch. < br / > < br / > This time out they play two brothers - in - law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board.",1
"Moreover, 4 - Q - 3 is clearly based on the Tin Man from "" The Wizard of Oz "" while Artie Deco is definitely a cheap vacuum cleaner. ).",1
The hysterical Hardware Wars is finally out on DVD.,1
"Out of all the parodies of Star Wars I've seen, this is probably the funniest. 13 min.",1
I cried.,1
and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact. That's what makes it so great! It was shot to look cheap ( or was it just cheap? ) Buy it. Nothing is sacred.,1
The funniest 12 minutes ever made. < br / > < br / > 10 out of 10. Hardware Wars is incredibly funny. It's stupid but it's fun.,1
It is so great to know I wasn't only one that loved that show! Thanks for making my day! I remember many of the moves but not nearly all of it. I LOVED the show.,1
i lost about 50 lbs. i can't believe this show is forgotten.,1
I'll be buying the dv or tape for sure. < br / > < br / > 9 / 10.,1
God bless you both. They will be sadly missed. I give the movie 10 out of 10.,1
"The dialogue was funny at times lightening the mood, and the plot engaging. It was a shame that it wasn't released at cinemas for a wider audience.",1
The dialogue is good. So anyway I liked it.,1
"And it does. In a role that could be a cliche, he made it real. I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland.",1
"Excellent acting, very believable. ! People watch movies for a variety of different reasons.",1
You be the judge < br / > < br / > Claudette - An African - American transvestite. < br / > < br / > John Hatter ( Mickey's boss ) - Is he really'mad '? Below is a list of the ones I uncovered. ( One wonders what this film could have been if there'd been money for a few more rewrites and a few more takes. ),1
"I really would like to see it released on DVD. It is not the quantity, but the quality that counts. Definite it would be added to my'all time classics'right away! We are all going to die one day sooner or later.",1
"It didn't take long to realize that this was a gem. I can't think of a single thing that bothers me about it. I checked it out on IMDb and got curious. In closing I can only say : Wonderful movie, see it if you get the chance. It's dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also humorous.",1
So glad I have HBO right now.,1
"< br / > < br / > And I am a 25 year old male that just wanted to see a free movie. Let me start out with saying I was VERY surprised with the production value of this movie. The best part is this is not a film FOR Christians, it is a Family film without the cheesy 7th Heaven feel. Humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this film... not by a long shot.",1
"I mean, everything is flawless for me in this motion picture. The Cure is one of the few movies I rated 10 out of 10. < br / > < br / > 10 / 10, nicely done!",1
Keep the kleenex nearby. This is a good tearjerker. One of the boys has AIDS.,1
"Which kinda pulled me two ways. For instance, I know they're young, but I found it a real task to belief in things these boys do. For that fact alone, it's a recommended view.",1
"Very well - acted by all, especially Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. But remember to have the Kleenex ready!",1
Writing prompt centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective.,1
< br / > < br / > The basic idea is : Dexter ( Joseph Mazzello ) has AIDS. Brad Renfro does very well in this movie as well.,1
Walter and Jack had such a great chemistry together as friends / brother in - laws. < br / > < br / > 7 / 10 I'd recommend this movie for nice laugh if you want one.,1
< br / > < br / > Overall this movie was excellent. There were other great scenes throughout the movie. Dexter doesn't get up to laugh nor does he show any kind of laughter. At that part i lost it. You just have to.,1
This was such a beautiful film. A must see!! Extreme heartwarming.,1
Thanks. But I just had a question about the music is the movie.,1
"Very emotional and very sad, The Cure is a must - see movie. The Cure is a fantastic film about a boy with AIDS.",1
"Very well done. And the tragic finale with Dexter's contraction of AIDS is enough to make me shed tear. When the movie "" The Cure "" starts, we find out about a young man named Erik ( Brad Renfro ).",1
He did an incredible job. The trees are the greenest I've ever seen. The acting also rates up there.,1
"< br / > < br / > Definitely check this one out, but prepared with your Kleenex - - you'll need! The story of true friendship in the face of a very real monster is an inspiration and quite touching.",1
"It is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood. < br / > < br / > The talent from the two young leads of Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello, who play Erik and Dexter respectively, is exceptional.",1
"It was actually the most touching film I have ever seen. I cried a bucket! Honestly, just thinking about it makes my eyes teary.",1
It's something worth watching. It's not meant to be a deep movie.,1
Great casting!,1
"But, of course, what really carries this movie, is the performances of the two leads - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. A bucket movie. Together, they embark on an adventure to find a cure - which to Erik seems to be just around the corner - so that all this silly AIDS thing will go away and they can be friends forever. Only this one isn't. A tear jerker. I had seen The Cure when I was a kid and I loved it then.",1
I was in tears at the end. No movie has effected me the way this one did.,1
"Peter Horton, who as I know had no major experience in movie directing before, showed his great abilities and talents in this sphere. So it's easy to understand that I've met lots of troubles trying to find this movie. Annabelle Sciorra also give a terrific performance as Dexter's mother. So all that I can say about The Cure is one simple word great.",1
"However, Eric overcomes his fear and risks everything. The latter has acquired AIDS from a blood transfusion.",1
In my opinion this show really is excellent.,1
"All characters are brilliant. < br / > < br / > So please, release it, let it go! There are only 2 series! < br / > < br / > All characters are played / portrayed brilliantly. ).",1
"I don't think this cartoon was as bad as some may think. Of course, I was only five at the time it came out. Gee, I wonder why?",1
Alanna declares her love for Sam BEFORE he tells her of his recent discovery. What a stunner whoever she was! And that makes all the difference in this film. Also note gorgeous blonde to the right of Barthelmess at the roulette table. After his father dies he takes over the business ( banking? ),1
A competent comedy that delivers the laughs for fans of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.,1
< br / > < br / > Multi - talented Frank Albertson has a small role as Barthelmess'improvident buddy. Beautiful Constance Bennett is the millionaire's daughter who makes Barthelmess miserable. < br / > < br / > The original Technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded with time to a ruddy tint.,1
"Sam has yet to learn this lesson. It seems that Allana and her wealthy father are vacationing in the same motel. Chinese - Americans are treated like second - class citizens, and whites hold them in nothing but contempt. They fall madly in love together. Everybody at the motel knows about Sam being a Chinaman with the exception of Allana.",1
Callum Blue is perfect for the part of Eric Newby. I think he'right!,1
"Half comedy, half romance, the story is simple and unambiguous. Nicola Piovani's musical score also adds to the Mediterranean flavour. Only Newby, injured, remains at large.",1
"However, it's charming pleasure from first scene to the last. < br / > < br / > Marion Davies plays his daughter - by - error and it's a tour de force for her.",1
The problem here is the script. The story falls into unbelievable melodrama in the last reel. Worth a look.,1
"Ray Milland plays her long - lost "" brother. "" Hmmmm, sounds familiar.",1
He's just excellent in this this gem.,1
Halliwell Hobbes & Doris Lloyd also appear to advantage. < br / > < br / > The film's top - billed star is Marion Davies. Can he find satisfaction in his new role as THE BACHELOR FATHER?,1
"This is certainly a well done tour de force. It's a time that people won't soon forget. Starring John Savage, Trea Williams and Beverly D'Angelo. One can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture. ).",1
FABIAN 100 %!!!! !,1
It is about real people making the best of their lives.,1
"They are thoughtful, scenic and have great plots. I have seen all of the Redford / Hillerman series. Adam Beach is a highly under rated and under used actor. It's great.",1
On to the next episode!,1
Now it's part of my collection. I laughed so hard that it hurt. I was Rollin. I love this type of comedy.,1
"They live together but are both having doubts about their relationship. < br / > < br / > Check it out if you get chance. aspects of life, can it in fact do the opposite and only make you feel more constrained?",1
I loved this movie. > It's a lot of laughs.,1
"I was hugely impressed with this movie, if for nothing else than for the comedy. < br / > < br / > The acting is great from everyone. I've always liked him.",1
I've seen this movie several times and have not been bored. It raises again and again in my thoughts. All the actors and actresses played well.,1
"An unexpected, very enjoyable surprise. Thanks! I am in my late 40's and she in her early 50's. I think this movie would have appeal to both young and old.",1
"Something innocent and critical at once. Racism. Until we got to "" W "". If they were in that film. Something with dance. Then. How could we? It struck home.",1
She has a lot less experience. < br / > < br / > Good movie.,1
"It's a good movie, not a consolation prize for teary women around world. It's worth a watch. It's really not a silly romantic comedy. Well, the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected.",1
"Too bad she doesn't get the recognition she deserves. < br / > < br / > What surprised me most about "" Seeing Other People "" was how funny it is. We see how couple works through this strange situation. There are some genuine laughs here. < br / > < br / > Good supporting performances help immensely, too.",1
The best romantic comedy I've seen in years.,1
"Which is the story of Alice and Ed. < br / > < br / > Jay Mohr, is an excellent match for Ms. Nicholson. His Ed is perfectly credible. Basically, she carries movie. Her Alice is a study in contrasts. Both do wonders together.",1
"They have amicable traits though, even though they are covered by the image of sex driven kittens. < br / > < br / > On another level, the film follows some of it'ensemble into different relationship work. < br / > < br / > The film goes the way films should go these days, showing that guys are sensitive at heart and have morals. < br / > < br / > By the end of the film, Mohr and Very funny stuff.",1
"As the frame freezes, we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. From here on out, we welcome that the story about to unfold will enjoy a point of view from both sexes. Sophisticated sex comedies are always difficult to pull off. < br / > < br / > Two months shy of their vows, Ed & Alice already look and act like an old married couple.",1
"Witty dialogue and comic set - ups make this one funny as hell! I thought this film was a divine story. Any Richter takes home award for most moralistic character. Romantic and funny, or just plain fun. ).",1
Great cast.,1
It was refreshing to watch. I rented this movie without having heard ( or read ) anything about it. What a shame!,1
The sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent. This is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person.,1
I just couldn't stop.,1
"If you like this kind of movies, try this one! < br / > < br / > I myself liked it very much. Okay, maybe this movie not a revolution. Many crimes.",1
7 out of 10 ( just ). ! There are a few funny moments in this but they get fewer and fewer as the film deteriorates into a comedy farce.,1
"Paul Reiser is very good - - - definitely better than he was on TV. Whiffs of Tarantino, etc. Liv Tyler gives a great performance and you absolutely cannot take your eyes off her. Not brilliant, not trash. Okay. As for his coif, well, see the film.",1
"A very funny movie. He was terrific, as were all the performers. 2. I'd like to see him do more of these low life roles.",1
"Then...... I´ll better stop here to tell the plot. He takes Jewel to his home. How could I forget him? Suddenly a shot - Utah´s dead. She made the big screen shining! And, of course, Michael Douglas.",1
such a smart comedy!,1
The studio ditched it. Seriously.,1
"Liv Tyler. Howard Zwart's direction is colorfully zippy balancing the script's quick - fire gags and frenetically fun, if complicated situations.",1
With no nudity she oozes sex in this film.,1
"The plot is very good, very bizarre and extreme, which makes it a good black comedy.",1
"It could be subtitled, three ways of looking at LiV Tyler.",1
"No. It doesn't have any sympathy for any of the men, really. Dillon was never that innocent, etc. Think Nurse Betty, or Jawbreaker. Reiser's BBQ fantasy is a great touch. It seems that way because of the form, but the ending says it all.",1
"In some ways, this movie is the comedy version of "" American Beauty, "" but in others, it is a world apart. But who could < br / > < br / > "" It all started one night at McCool's "" explains each of the three men to their various listeners. I always get nervous when a director of commercials and music videos turns to filmmaking. Zwart resists that tendency. Randy is the first to see her, as an individual treats her unkindly.",1
The use of his poetry was the highlight of the piece itself. Most enjoyable.,1
"What's there not to like? And a beautifully nuanced performance by Eileen Atkins as his mum is an added bonus. It is always more than looks, women moved beyond his baldness, deafness and short sightedness.",1
I don't see what everyone hates this movie. I just don't see what is so bad about this movie. I loved this movie!,1
Critters 4 is a good movie.,1
"However, I did like this movie, I compare it mostly with the third movie ( which were bad ). Lastly I liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series, so at least we won't see a Critters 5 anymore. The Critters also have different deaths in this movie which made this a little special, especially at the end with the frozen Critter. Ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise.",1
"There is even a scene that mocks 18th century Western social events, and ends with clever and entertaining fighting.",1
Why have these two men not fought each other more is beyond me. Third this movie is off the chain. My Young Auntie is unique in a lot of ways. 9.,1
"No longer does he easily jaunt through life without a care in the world. If you're looking for a kung - fu action movie, look elsewhere.",1
A great film.,1
"Complete with episodes of singing and dancing! So the film has considerable historical import as well. At any rate, quite clearly Liu Chia Liang made this connection and decided he would explore it close to its limits.",1
I loved it! !,1
"I was 10. It is a great story and told extremely well. ; ). The music, the dancing, the acting. It'timeless. I first saw this movie in the theater.",1
! a great film.,1
I just finished screening El Padrino in Germany. A great film.,1
A phenomenal piece of film work. We look forward to seeing many more films from Mr. Chapa in the future. We just finished screening El Padrino in Australia.,1
This movie makes your heart race. I loved it and I give it 10 stars. !,1
For example in Netherlands is was ranked number 3. If you have the chance view the film and enjoy it.,1
! This movie very simply gets an A plus from me. Watch this film!!!! The story was made for these actors.,1
A main stream cast for such a low budget. Thankyou for being different and having the guts to write like you do. This movie has a cutting edge to it.,1
Definite a must see. It had me on my toes. This movie was a modern day scarface.,1
Rent it! < br / > < br / > Rent It!!! !,1
< br / > < br / > B. S.,1
"< br / > < br / > I love the fashion in this movie. Claude's beige knitted The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. They're not drawn as caricatures, but as realistic and very human people. Thank god for this movie. It's a document of talent that, three decades later, seems even more unique and rare in retrospect.",1
A war begins as the street is in arms against Lords of wealth and corrupt Power. I found the cast of this movie to be outstanding and is not a Movie to be ignored. ! I was glad to find it has been everything anticipated. This film will leave you riveted.,1
The story instantly gets you interested. This movie was simply amazing.,1
I was blown away. The stunts are expansive. And Tilly is HOT.,1
Finally a gangster Movie worth watching!,1
"this movie. Hey, who needs an Oscar anyway?",1
The directing was also magnificent. ! The movie is just an all around masterpiece.,1
Better music would have top this film. The casting was picked real well. And in my history thats how it was. Damien Congratulatoins on this film.,1
I think it was a pretty good film.,1
Great Great Great. This film is just really Great. To see how to make a cheap film work. Here only a 260. Buy this movie! I don't know why.,1
"This movie really stands out. """,1
It's really a shame. I don't understand how people could not like this movie.,1
"I admit, some of the content is a little corny and ripped off, but so what, every movie rips off another to some extent. Who needs special effects? Think of Resovoir Dogs. I think not. Think about it : Star Wars, E. T., Ghostbusters, etc. All good movies, but the rest of the top - grossing movies are usually cliched tripe with non - sensical plots and lots of eye candy. < br / > < br / > Toy Soldiers is fun. Well some movies don't need ny of that junk.",1
"It's packed with action, packed with excitement and has some humorous moments as well. I just wonder what he's doing now.",1
"Astin and Gosset Jr. give good performances. They're actually pretty clever about it, too.",1
The US Army forces at the end are accurately dressed and armed for the time.,1
This film is a perfect example of great escapism!,1
what a movie this one!! ! 1 in IMDb list???,1
"I've avoided seeing this film for some time but finally picked up a copy. It drops some of the songs ( The Bed, My Conviction, Frank Mills ) and cuts others ( Walking in Space ). < br / > < br / > The film.",1
Just don't think too much and you'll love it - enjoy!,1
< br / > < br / > This was a fun ADVENTURE.,1
I only wish that it was available DVD!,1
"Not everything goes as planned for either side. This movie was believable. As a teenager he usually played the dopey best friend. He hated his father, and everything he stood for. Sean Astin is excellent.",1
"And the heroic Robert Folk score is the cherry on top. The camaraderie of Tepper's friends, their grief over Joey's death, and their joy at their survival, all are genuinely moving. Ooh - rah, General Kramer! This is one of the most entertaining "" bad "" movies in my pantheon.",1
< br / > < br / > You can't go wrong with this one if you like action. I give it a solid rating 8 / 10.,1
this film has always been stuck in my mind. just a great film. death scene or billy spitting in the terrorists sandwiches or the one kids ( no idea of his name ) fake asthma attack.,1
"This is my 2nd all time favorite movie, ( Stand By Me being 1st. ) The script, the acting, the screenplay. Everything in the movie is very exceptional. At all!!",1
why is he so powerful?,1
"I enjoyed everyone's performances. The scene when Astin is attempting to escape is a perfect example. ! Why does it sound like the Goonies? The film is dark, with dark overtones.",1
This is really good.,1
I recommend it with a lot of hype!,1
"< br / > < br / > So how's the action? Will Wheaton from "" Stand by Me "" lends nice support to the film and Andrew Divoff is a terrific villain.",1
"Will they be able to do it? Still, I enjoyed it lot. This is a mindless action film.",1
"In my opinion, the plot is captivating. I hope that he someday gets the accolades he deserves for his acting.",1
Again i am voting for an underrated movie. He has done well since the goonies.,1
"To tell you the truth I felt a brief tremor. where? Actually like me at the moment! Come Back Shane! "" But I just couldn't recognize her with her clothes on! Till I found out while the closing credits.. OHH MY GOD! ).",1
This is a cult film for many reasons. He also heavily plays with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity he builds all the time. And some dare give lessons in democracy to foreign countries.,1
""". fun comedy without pretence.",1
"Anyhow, she's wearing really well. I did and it helped me. It's better than a lot of this genre. ( Was it Knot Landing? ) I don't usually like flashbacks but in this film they work.",1
"< br / > < br / > However, as evidence piles up against Denny, his story changes. I gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10.",1
"< br / > < br / > Enjoy! It'actually pretty well. < br / > < br / > The acting isn't anything to crow about, although the guy who plays Wayne Kennedy is pretty creepy enough.",1
For a LifeTime Movie it was better than most. These were only technical glitches and did not take from file.,1
Though what is the deal with boat races at this time? This one though isn't quite as good. Was there some weird fascination with them? This one has these guys going to Nantucket to spend there summer vacation.,1
YES! it was one of those films that Home Box Office showed every other day throughout my youth. THIS IS the teen comedy... this film is forever lodged in my brain.,1
This is not always the case. It never lets you rest. Little that is dirty in it.,1
It was so hilarious I have seen it too many times to count. They were great. My college roommate and I just couldn't get enough of it. Who couldn't love this crazy movie?!,1
It was a early look at those now super stars. This is classic 80's humor.,1
"< br / > < br / > All things considered, this is an amazing movie. It's interesting how they make the army officials enforcing the draft look ridiculous. The only negative comment I could say is that it'sometimes hard to hear the dialog. 10 / 10 stars! < br / > < br / > Also, the music is really cool. Wow.",1
Better Off Dead ( BOD ) was cast so much better. Plot was good.,1
"10 / 10 They were both excellent movies! I seem to notice that a lot of people have never seen this movie, and those that have usually dismiss it as garbage... that's pretty bad really. < br / > < br / > I can honestly say that Savage Steve Holland is a genius!",1
There isn't quite as much left field absurdity going on here.,1
"Also see "" Better Off Dead "" and "" How I Got Into College. "" Enjoy!",1
!,1
Believe it or not Demi Moore is his co star...,1
Watch it.,1
What can I say about this movie except that it is great fun!,1
Annie Golden's role was minor but she acted very well. It was the film that practically launched John Savage as an actor.,1
"OCS was a follow - up to Better Off Dead, returning Cusack and Curtis Armstrong from that film. One of the homes, needing it's mortgage repaid belongs to Demi Moore ( Cassandra ). ), George, and budding love - interest Cassandra, perhaps Hoops can come to terms with his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood. < br / > < br / > Memorable scenes include Bobcat getting stuck in a Godzilla suit (! )",1
Single funniest scene : Egg in a Godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party. An absolute hoot.,1
"as the love interest of, once again, chronically depressed Cusack.",1
"We could use more movies from the likes of him. < br / > < br / > One Crazy Summer is an underrated movie, with lots of great characterizations and gags.",1
"Plus, they are all extremely campy because of how alien they are to my western eyes. ( 9 / 10 ) They're great films sure, but generally not the most entertaining material out there. However, the countries within the Iron Curtain apparently enjoyed their escapist musicals just as much as the states had. They certainly don't resemble the musicals made in the West. < br / > < br / > As for the film clips themselves, they're very entertaining.",1
This one succeeds at both. What is the purpose of any documentary?,1
"But as this film shows, if you were a filmmaker looking to entertain, it better be with a'message '. But at the same time, perhaps out of this repression, some interesting, funny, and ( from what I saw ) up - beat films were made. < br / > < br / > In short, some good stuff... but only if interested, really. I was shown the film in a class on documentary films, and half the class fell asleep.",1
Although some of the Stalinist films look laughingly bad ( The Bright Road (? ) < br / > < br / > I notice that the sound for the sixties films was much better.,1
"( Look for the closing dedication to the person who made it all possible. ) ) < br / > < br / > The documentary is marred by somewhat insipid narration but it's still a lot of fun to watch. In this film - within - a - film, the producers spoof their own creative plight with the story of a group of filmmakers under Party orders to make a musical. Some scenes did deliver, including a rousing clip from a Soviet film called "" Tractor Drivers. """,1
"i really recommend it, it'great! ! it's a nice, good, and sometimes funny film. my friend and i loved the film.",1
!,1
"comes in a close second. Bears about as much resemblance to Dean Koontz's novel as Jessica Simpson does to a rocket scientist. movie. And yet I can't help liking it. Hmm, it's gotta be the puppy chow, right? Ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie, and this is no exception.",1
All in all the movie is a dog. No surprises.,1
"The dog Einstien was impressive since it was well trained. Watchers has it's good points, the film does have some gory scenes in parts.",1
"< br / > < br / > The script for this film was originally written by Paul Haggis, who later disowned it. The plot obviously takes some influence from Predator and begins with an explosion at a research lab. A secret Government agency is soon on the case, as the murders continue. I don't know why the writing here is nowhere near as ridiculous as his 2004 hit Crash! Michael Ironside also appears in the film and does well as the'bad cop'side of the Government agents. Anyway, main reason this film works is undoubtedly the dog, who aside from being rather cute, is also the best actor in the film.",1
"So is director Jon Hess. This is true. It's pretty good, not excellent. It's based on the book.",1
You gotto watch to learn more. OK read on. Only she was a snake in the past life. Then throws grenades.,1
! Subsequently the woman is born again on earth. This movie is without a doubt the best I have seen in my entire life. You simply HAVE to watch this movie!!,1
"Because this movie can heal your faith. Back to the movie. TODAY. This was flawless. And that is the segment of people this movie was aimed at. And that is so not like your average Bollywood type movies. If you are an atheist or an agnostic by any chance, this movie is again a must for you. Not you average movie - goers by any chance!. And if you like it, here are some more recommendation from me. I don't think it'd even be going too far saying that this movie can cure cancer. Just go and watch it.",1
"< br / > < br / > Bad guy 2 : Yes, we won't do it again. Don't blame them! It has the most amateur effects, yet you enjoy every moment!",1
Aquarius!,1
< br / > < br / > I equate it to playing modern rock for an 80 year old. Don't let the rating of 5.,1
I had expected something but was surprised to see that it turned out to be the opposite. ! Primarily he was influenced by Dino Risi and his film IL SORPASSO. I highly recommend all 3 movies! The same thing happens to Albert De Santi.,1
"Albert is a shy, retiring sort, and Louie... well Louie is not. There are twists and turns that add depth to this film. Albert is played delightfully by Michael Imperioli. ). Louie has just gotten out of prison. On The Run is a chronicle of mad - cap, zany, situations. < p > < br / > < br / > There are other stand - out performances as well. The audience adored her.",1
"To me this one at least rates eight out ten. In those days much of our full - length comedy fare hailed from Denmark ( Nils Poppe anyone? ) Granted, without the nostalgia component it would probably be just another fair - to - middling comedy. Must be some special ingredient that makes Martin & Lewis product stay fresher longer.",1
Dean and Jerry dancing is a bit of a treat. Good ending. They are believable. He does stand out even though he is an extra here. The songs are not memorable. They both look great as young sailors.,1
EXCELLENT!,1
"I liked this movie. < br / > < br / > No one I know likes it, but I do. < br / > < br / > I give it 8. If Warner Bros. had thought of that, it could've made the movie better, also.",1
( 1919 2003 ) Please stop comparing it to the first! There is nothing alike and has a mood all its own. This is a great exponent of screwy mid - 80s comedy. '< br / > < br / > Robert Stack - WE LOVE YOU!!! !,1
This film is a real masterpiece.,1
"80s script? they are 2 totally different mooded films. yes. but, he does pull off the snobbish demands of the part and we want to see him fall. < br / > < br / > i really loved part 2 over the first. rodney's a bigger name and more distinct. i did like the murray / chase one better.",1
He's known for being a comic's comic.,1
"Robert Stack ( Airplane! ) There's nothing wrong with that except this : The return of Chevy Chase as Ty Webb. ( We miss you, Ted! ) Danny Noonan should have been back. was good in the ` new'Ted Knight / Villian role. He carried a big part of the first film, so his return would have put Caddyshack 2 over the top.",1
A good end to series. I think this is a great movie. Everyone is entitled to an opinion.,1
"No. Are his lines as good? But he is funny. < br / > < br / > The film is predictable, but aren't most in this genre? The first film is a cult classic ; what could possibly follow it up?",1
"Caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly - held classic. Jackie Mason rarely misses a beat, and is consistently likable and very funny The movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. It comes across as far more self - conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. For my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over - directed. He comes off as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too heavily on either.",1
Perhaps this is why the murders seemed surprised at the end. They had a whole week? How did they do that without breaking and entering the car?,1
"The antiwar musical "" Hair "" is my number one cult - movie. I believe this is one of the most beautiful, sad and touching conclusions of cinema history.",1
"However, this is not the real issue. I finally watched the third film in Mehta's trilogy : "" Fire "". I'll believe it when I see it. Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality. I am no expert regarding either the Worse, if someone like Mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats. India is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change.",1
"I was totally ready to hate him. I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I walked into the theater I wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time. Yeah, we get it. It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it. < br / > < br / > Darn you, ape man!",1
But of course he knows instantly when they are talking baloney. It just gives an episode a bit more drama and bite.,1
"or any stories reminiscent of the Leopold and Loeb case, you may find this movie entertaining. This is always an excellent theme. I believe this film came out in 1990 right after Menendez killings.",1
"Forensic evidence is almost nonexistent. duo, eager for progress reports and an ear for their theories. ( No, Columbo was not after the man's job. )",1
You also get a realistic reaction from the arrogant preppy killers.,1
What all us fans know is that Columbo needs a worthy opponent. And I do.,1
"Plot is breathtaking. John Hurt is excellent as always. God bless our country, USA!",1
Fun movie! The story is the true star.,1
"The film follows the lives of two families, who decide to escape using a hot - air balloon manufactured by themselves.",1
"A great cast of actors, dancers and singers.",1
"Go See It! Even during the same events, they shift back and forth. I was surprised as I watched this movie, how much it had'encaptured'me.",1
I would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape. The opening of Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year. It is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed.,1
"< br / > < br / > The Strelzyk's and the Wetzel's were two families that decided they weren't going to take it anymore. This movie accurately portrays the struggle life was for the typical East German. The crashed balloon is discovered by border guards and an relentless search begins for the conspirators who are determined to try again. < br / > < br / > There are tense moments as they gather and jimmy - rig the necessary materials for the flight. < br / > < br / > Despite the extreme danger involved in escaping to the West, they feel the rewards far outweighed the risks.",1
A real surprise. It is pure entertainment.,1
"It brings back memories of realising just how lucky I was to live in a free country. In 1988, I toured the DDR from East to West, North to South. East Germany had changed little since 1967. Why?",1
"Co - starring Dennis Lipscomb, Emily Longstreth and Henry Gibson. However, the mystery isn't very compelling in the end.",1
"< br / > < br / > There is an audience for this film if they're looking for more contemporary version of film noir. This movie is a coveted member of my movie library. While not a mainstream film, it is, in my view, a highly effective film noir in which Eric Roberts is totally underrated as an actor. Careful of what? I should've asked.",1
Everything about it is right. It didn work.,1
"If you have time to see only one martial arts movie this year, don't miss classic.",1
I can't wait to someday see live! Totally revolutionary and wonderful.,1
Brilliant!,1
Also good is Stanley Baker as the Thief - Taker and Alan Badel is good as always.,1
"None the less, it happened.",1
"The film was shot in Glencree and Wicklow Ireland and the sets were very well done and seemed realistic. < br / > < br / > Overall, I really enjoyed this film. It is regrettable that it has not ever ( to my knowledge ) been released on video or DVD. The story follows the ( supposedly true ) exploits of hiway - man Jack Shepard in 1700's London.",1
"? Please, if there is an upcoming release, let us all know. Does anyone out there have a copy of the Bravo concert for sale?",1
"( I only bought it because it had some songs that weren't on the TV special. ) And the backup singers are a large part of the visual punchline as well. If you listen to their "" Dan Band Live "" CD, that's all you'll get, and it'll get old quick. FAME! """,1
He is just an incredible performer. I can't forget his backup singers.,1
This was on Bravo last night. Great voice! Charisma to burn! Man I loved show!,1
This guy can do anything.,1
"I think i were near 6 - 8 parts of the movie. "" Everybody loved that movie which was on TV every year.",1
"Treat Williams lights up screen as Berger, the unconventional and free - spirited hippie who does his best to get Claude to loosen up and is matched scene for scene by Savage as Claude, who brings a lovely sweetness to the role of Claude. There is one outstanding musical number after another here... "" Aquarius "" is a tour through Central Park which includes dancing horses... Annie Golden is a charmer as Jeannie, the pregnant hippie who is pregnant by Wright or Dacus, doesn't know which one is the father and doesn't seem to care.",1
"Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while pirates do.",1
"). I was a schoolboy when I watched this film for the first time. Meanwhile, some of them nowadays became much more realistic than they seemed in 1984! < br / > < With their inventiveness, curiosity, humour, dreaminess.",1
"One of smarter gangsters, although all things are relative. Nevertheless it is a good taste borrower! < br / > < br / > Gangsters don't make money they take money. With a little bit of luck I won't bother naming them. And why not? this "" home entertainment "" effort has to fall slap bang in the middle. Usually by fear. and the ending is weak and "" so what? """,1
"You knew who was on whose side, etc. I somehow managed to find it enjoyable. All in all, the movie wasn t half - bad.",1
This movie have 4 parts and every is around 170 minutes long.,1
Very well done acting and directing.,1
"If you can't, then you probably won't like this film very much at all. It's worth seeing despite not being especially believable. ! < br / > < br / > First, Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy arrive when their plane crashes. Silly, slight but also very charming.",1
< br / > < br / > PETTICOAT FEVER is one such film.,1
Barbara Hershey'Rose was also a treasure. It's an easy film to recommend. ).,1
"Do not attempt to compare them. And the ending that has been added is just amazing. The acting and photography are excellent. While it is most certainly not perfect, it is much better than it is given credit for. This is not the musical you see in theatres.",1
"Juhi Chawla is beautiful and bubbly. In short, A great love story with passion. She is her usual self.",1
"Shahrukh Khan keeps phoning Juhi and tells her that he loves her too bits. Honestly it was a entertaining movie, but if you look carefully its not too realistic. Some good songs including Tu mere samne being best. Juhi Chawla is cute as ever in a fairly good performance.",1
His personality fit the role perfectly. Darr ( 1993 ) was an incredible movie.,1
"And after you see the movie, have songs and scenery playing in your mind... forever. You will feel sad and happy and relieved and afraid at the same time.",1
Since Darr Yash Chopra has slipped bit. This was Yash Chopra'last masterpiece.,1
"If for nothing else, watch this movie for Shahrukh. It is must see! Very clever.",1
"His character was very likable, but too perfect. Juhi Chawla is decent. Tanvi Azmi supports well. Dil To Pagal Hai was fresh and perfect to watch. He does a good job though. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic. And Veer - Zaara was magical.",1
"). The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old. The other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus, and Dorsey Wright.",1
Sunil Malhotra a dare devil navy employee is one such guy. He loves her deeply and even engaged to marry her.,1
Kiran is engaged to Sunil. The story is excellent. The movie belongs to Srk. The screenplay is brilliant.,1
If all Bollywood films are like this then we're watching more. PS any recommendations would be appreciated! I'm glad I did!!,1
"Darr is a great movie! But Juhi and Sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie. < br / > < br / > It's just too bad that Shahrukh and Juhi weren't exactly "" together "" in the film. Never in my life will I forget the line, "" I love you K.. k.. k.. Kiran! "" < br / > < br / > A must see for everyone! I also thought "" Tu Mere Samne "" was quite nice also.",1
"She fears one & fears for the other. simply "" Darr "" is one of the best Indian films ever made. < br / > < br / > And finally'Darr'is Kiran's story who is caught between one man's love and another man's obsession.",1
"He'done similar roles before, but he's good. Whether it's Shah Rukh chanting his trademark "" I love you, K... k... k... kiran! "" Like I said, Juhi looks like a Goddess in this film. ).",1
< br / > < br / > Is this an All in the Family or Seinfeld type show? Absolutely not.,1
It is like still standing but to the next level.,1
"I love the option of seeing in Widescreen. I love this film!!!!!! MGM rocks for doing this on many of their DVD releases. ! It never looked better! < br / > < br / > It's nice to see it again, this time on DVD.",1
"Where is the realism? Steph "" cuts from school and gets caught by her father. Where is the comedy in such a situation? With The War at Home, you get real situations from a real father type figure. You relate to a show like this when you are either. What parent knows the right thing to say, especially in a situation as this?",1
"i really like this series. his rants break the program up, and allow a really good flow. whilst it is a sitcom, it stands out due to the what could be awkward subjects.",1
does anyone know the real results of the shows viewings? PLEASE! Thank G * d for DVR's! Now we are stuck watching either crappy shows or DVD's. How bad was the show doing?,1
The war at home is a splendid television series and I don't understand because she has been annulled. !,1
It can be easily compared with married with.. children. Last episode opens many continuous and funny moments. My title says that it isn't show for conservative public.,1
I sure wish that this show wasn t canceled. Michael Rapaport is a star.,1
This show is verging on brilliant. yet will make you laugh at least a handful of times an episode. It isn't the world's most hilarious comedy. ( As is a classic example with Scru. ),1
"Teenagers have sex. < br / > < br / > Its appeal, at least for me, lies in its real situations. Like many situation comedies, "" The War at Home "" is getting better with each episode.",1
"< br / > < br / > Every episode does teach a'valuable lesson '. Like it or not, there are a lot of families out there just like this one. This show is actually pretty good.",1
I love how the parents have no idea how to deal with the kids. This isn't Happy Days or The Brady Bunch this is real life.,1
"! Beverly D'Angelo ( who plays Sheila Franklin, an uptown girl who is befriended by hippie group ) is sensational in her role! Despite their best efforts to dissuade him, Claude does eventually report for basic training in the Army.",1
A great rainy afternoon movie i recommend to all. ! Only those with hardest of hearts could fail to be moved by it.,1
"For the Sake of her 10 Children She Must Succeed! "" < br / > < br / > One of the best films that I have ever seenried from start to finish. She is also dying.",1
The role really deserved an Oscar. < br / > < br / > If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.,1
"That and knowing Warren. It was pretty accurate. I met most of the "" children "" at Warren's wedding in 1989. They had a reunion of the family who also got to meet the cast of the show. Yes, it is a hard movie to watch, but so amazing and heartfelt.",1
I felt as if she WAS Mrs. Frey. Thank you.,1
A terrific script - which still holds up 20 years after it was first made.,1
And TV never seem to show it. !,1
"It is the story of a woman who'll die soon. If you want a good cry, this is the one for you! But somehow we all sat down and watched this movie.",1
"I'm not lying, I cried from the opening credits to the ending credits. This has to be the ultimate chick flick ever.",1
Released on TV in 1983. Not to be missed.,1
It also does a unique justice to Central Park. I first saw this film in the early 80's on cable.,1
Touched by film all over!,1
I never saw Ms. Margaret perform a better part.,1
"imdb. A true story, very good.",1
"Living here in the US I have yet to meet anyone who has seen this movie. I am a great fan of this movie and would, and have, recommended it to all.",1
It should come on TV sometime so I can see it again. children. I cried non stop.,1
< br / > < br / > I really wish that someone with a lick of marketing sense would release a DVD version of this drama. But this gem from the early 1980's still slays me. I usually find more to mock than to empathize with in the sentimental cinematic tripe foisted upon us these days. And a well - written and well - acted story to boot. The scene in which the youngest of the children ( Steven ) is taken to his new home is the most heart - breaking I've ever watched. Among the special features one needs to include the Emmy Awards telecast the following year. Ann - Margret took a big chance in taking this role. ).,1
Vive La John Denver. Rushmore. That girl he beat was amazing. That mustache gets me riled up.,1
"< br / > < br / > Why don't you think about that? First of all, I should point out that I really enjoyed watching this documentary.",1
"I am not just from Turkey I am a part of Turkey. It shows we've never been one. Singers, band members! During that time I constantly lived in London. Especially Aynur and Sezen Aksu.",1
< br / > < br / > Then there is the music. ' I have never been to Istanbul but after having seen this film I am sure that I want to visit this place soon.,1
Istanbul is like the mixture of turkey.,1
< br / > < br / > Impive! The rest are just street musicians.,1
It would certainly encourage me to visit Istanbul. This movie is one of the most memorable films I have seen.,1
"A silver moon rises beyond the pine trees : I can sense it all in your heart's throbbing. Or not? I am listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. Are your lips wet?",1
Enschuldigen Sie. Faith Akin and Alexander Hacke have made a different approach for Turkish music.,1
"Now, I can add the sounds of music to ever - changing portrait of Istanbul.",1
Perfect. I liked the gag of Andre never tagging in. Or the fact that he did it pretty easily. He was always intense and obviously loved his job. And the tag team matches are all very exciting. < br / > < br / > Demolition was always at their best at WrestleMania.,1
"There are questions that sometimes hover over us and have no answer. Even so, it's a very beautiful picture, and a strong voice from strong director.",1
The Turkish Queen of Music Sezen Aksu... An important work art!,1
Beware! She is just marvellous.,1
"You could not do better if you went to Istanbul yourself. Some of the best female vocalists I've ever heard. < br / > < br / > CD soundtrack now available on amazon. Pricey. If this is your thing, you'll have a grand time. I could barely sit still in theatre. Lots of social and political background.",1
< br / > < br / > Faith Akin - this is a gem. < br / > < br / > One of the best music commentaries I have seen and heard in a long time.,1
"Akin's prize - winning 2004 movie Head - On / Gegen die Wand depicted the appealingly chaotic world of a self - destructive but dynamic Turkish - German rocker named Cahit ( Birol Ünel ). You get everything from rap to the most traditional Turkish classical song, with rock, Kurdish music, and Turkish pop in between.",1
Editing and the success of the director is very impressive.,1
"I highly recommend it to anyone. < br / > < br / > Great footage of Ceza, a Turkish rapper.",1
"But this movie does not only introduce you to the sound of Istanbul. All of them share a passion for music and the belief in its power. If you have never been in Istanbul, you will want to go there after having seen the film. Do not expect a compilation of Turkish folklore or anything like that. It also draws a compelling picture of Istanbul today and how Turkey has forged ahead in the last decade.",1
The music was mostly very interesting. Well done Faith Akin.,1
"The movie features different singers, instrumentalists and bands. This is a movie about the music that is currently being played in Istanbul. Spoken comments from the musicians nicely illustrate the music being played, and the social context in modern Turkey. Other important topics are omitted such as Turkish jazz music, or music of the Armenians and Greeks. For my perspective, the most interesting comments were from Orhan Gencebay. Today, it is a megalopolis of almost 10 million.",1
"Wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then. I had a place for both of them. Because there was bloodshed too in this long, heavy battle, the stakes were high - at least to me as a kid.",1
Since most old movies are being - made nowadays. < br / > < br / > It would be nice to see this movie redone in the future.,1
Johnny and his gang become wanted fugitives after the plan goes disastrously awry. Well worth seeing for Kinski fans. Kudos are also in order for Stelvio Cipriani's moody and spirited score. Klaus Kinski popped up in a sizable number of spaghetti Westerns throughout the 60's and early 70's ; he was usually cast in secondary parts as nasty villains.,1
"Ultimately, "" The Beast "" amounts to a tragic character study brimming with irony. Never mind that Kinski is ideally suited to the role of'Crazy'Johnny. This low - budget oater has nothing appetizing about it. "" He creeps up behind her and attacks her, but a bigger man armed with a rifle intervenes and he has to flee. They prey on the stagecoach and nobody is safe from their depredations.",1
"Why is he utterly forgotten? < br / > < br / where all the movie actors eat between takes. And unlike Harry Langdon and ( again ) Chaplin, Hamilton did not try for audience sympathy. Finally, our lad seats himself at a table, hoping to meet a celebrity.",1
"Yes, I know, Roscoe Arbuckle didn't like to be called'Fatty ', but I couldn't resist the joke. Or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting.",1
We watched it and it was a whole different ball game!,1
"This was a great anime. True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was kinda long. < br / > < br / > Don't miss this film.",1
"This is an excellent anime movie. < br / > < br / > THE PLOT : The plot is good. They occasionally in that piece use what I believe to be taiko drums, but i'm not sure. It is traditional without being unoriginal.",1
"I don't know of another film that deals with them. I enjoyed this for a couple of reasons. The film, then, challenges the sanitized version of victory and occupation with some gritty realities.",1
"Sgt David Brent ( James Best ) is shot, the battle goes on, and then it transitions to him being treated for his wounds. Verboten, however, deals with the post - war experience, as we only get in the opening scenes the big boom of WAR - in bold for a point. Simple, direct language. Instead, Fuller makes this a'Coming Home'kind of movie, though not at all in the sense that'this soldier comes home injured and so on and so on '.",1
"Hercules was another fellow who didn't really have a lot of luck at Wrestlemania. New tag team champions crowned. Not really a match, unfortunately. Plenty of luck for Brutus Beefcake as he ended Mr Perfect's undefeated streak. The Barbarian then defeated Tito Santana in a short match. Jim Duggan then beat Dino Bravo in a nothing match. < br / > < br / > Next match saw Earthquake defeat Hercules. It didn't work out.",1
But his unit really crossed well south of there - north of Worms Germany.,1
"She has so few lines. 9 / 10. The other main actors are good, as well. But Fuller keeps bringing her up as the film goes on. And the film ends too abruptly, and it lacks payoff.",1
I feel sort of the same way about slasher movies. I'm not a fan of gratuitous violence. I don't know if it's fair for me to review this. This kind of crud has to be stopped.,1
and i highly recommend to anyone.,1
"The acting from Pesci, Cortese and Vincent. This movie is also great as it's dialogue is good.",1
great. and authentic. it was well done. with great Dialogue. i thought it was great.,1
"Strong on characterization and visuals. Also present is that perennial screen wise guy, Frank Vincent.",1
"Let me ask you one more question "" Ha!",1
In the end Earthquake pins Hercules for the win. In the end Haku is pinned and we have New Tag Team Champions. Piper comes out half black / half white in what is considerably a classic moment. Really solid back and forth action from both of these talented guys. Perfect ). < br / > < br / > Match 3 : Earthquack vs Hercules - Very short match. The crowd is 100 % pro Demolition in this match. The Hart Foundation gets an easy win. Big dominant heels were really a popular thing at the time. R. I. P. to both men in match.,1
Joe Pesci's first big role. Clever dialog.,1
Who could have imagined?,1
"Here's one that nobody every heard of. Pesci fans should run to the video store to check out this flick. It's a low - budget, quickie B - movie - shot in the swamps of Jersey. This was probably his first shot, and it was a gem. My copy called it "" The Family Enforcer "". So ya think you've seen every Mafia movie ever made!",1
He only gets better with age. Nice to see the 1970's big cars. Too bad ; she did a good job!,1
She was frustrated enough to seem real. Daniel Magder was excellent. Not a bad MOW.,1
"Pulling in 2. 6 million viewers, one has to wonder what everyone's opinions on the storyline / plot is. < br / > < br / > Laura Leighton plays the victim, and she does it well. Sadly I was mistaken.",1
He doesn't even comment or seem to notice. < br / > < br / > Spoilers follow as to some specifics. This is the heart of the story and the kids are kept mostly blank in their reaction. But the children are never shown to react one way or the other. Another gap.,1
"HUGE Pop for Demolition. Quake wins with his sit down splash. < br / > < br / > Matches. I'm not really fan of either, so It didn't perk my interest much. Martel wins, with the Boston Crab.",1
"Production is first rate as well. There are quite a few deaths, some surprising. No car chases either. We have seen this type film many times over the years. These 2 actors were among the best.",1
"Now he's hiding out with his two kids. Obligation gives may to caution. < br / > < br / > Davos was a top gangster in Paris who took care of his friends. That's why it has style. He calls his friends in Paris to help him out. For Davos'two best friends, time has passed and they've moved on. That was several years ago.",1
"Much of the first third of the film concerns their covert return. Both grew up in France and eventually had to flea due to their criminal activities. And, like these other films, he also has a very strong, though twisted, moral code. Now in Italy as the film begins, they continue to live the life of thugs and the heat is on to catch them. < br / > < br / > Overall, this is a very good crime film - - sort of like French Film Noir. < br / > < br / > Along the way, Davos meets and is taken in my a stranger, Eric Stark ( Jean - Paul Belmondo ).",1
"Classe tous risques "" feels like the granddaddy of "" The Sopranos "" in mixing the criminal and the domestic, and of the buddy film to feel as contemporary as "" Reservoir Dogs. "" Rugged, craggy Lino Ventura captures the screen immediately as the criminal dad. And the second thug is clearly a casually avuncular presence in their lives, as they smoothly coordinate the theft and escape, in cars, buses, on boats and motorcycles, in easy tandem. They can tousle a kid's hair - and then shoot a threat in cold blood.",1
"In his absence, he has been sentenced to death in his home country of France for his crimes. Sautet immediately agreed and the rest as they say is history.",1
"< br / > < br / > Much like Melville's film, the seemingly simple story gets more subtlety complicated as it goes along. Stark becomes Abel's chauffeur and eventual only friend in an underworld that turns it's back on Abel after everything he's done and been through. Classe Tous Risques is a definite keeper. It never ends pretty for them, or their loved ones.",1
"< br / > < br / > Ventura portrays a gangster whose die is cast when the movie begins. ; wonderful black and white cinematography by Ghislain Cloquet. What a year for him! """,1
Up there with the best of Melville.,1
"He gets the aid of Eric Stark ( Jean - Paul Belmondo, a role in tune with Le Doulos only with a smidgen more humanity and charisma ), who is also thief and drives him into Paris. A couple of times the plot may seem to be leisurely, but it isn't. It was well worth the admission, as Classe tous risques is one of those kinds of French films that is just waiting to be re - discovered ( or discovered for the first time ).",1
"Davos'few, hard words to his children describing their life of secrecy from there on get a hold on your throat to the end of the film. It is almost film - noir meet neo - realism. Belmondo's restrained performance under Sautet's firm direction only shows what a wonderful actor he could - and should - have been.",1
< br / > < br / > Overall Grade - B < br / > < br / > Some matches were a complete waste of time.,1
The soundtrack for this movie kicks butt! YIKES!,1
"There is no place for any hope. The woman seduces a man into using it thus accelerating his doom. and in my opinion still very watchable. Somehow she represents what men see in women in a basic, unoffensive way.",1
"This in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience. < br / > < br / > Neither is it a masterpiece, of course. You may now be able to guess how this all ends. It's fair to say, then, that critical reception is mixed.",1
"She's wandering too, sort of, and is maybe too friendly with a big - time pusher named Wolf. perfectly shot landscapes. The film is, at least, true enough to keep one interested, but in its own kind of truth it's strange, biased.",1
"But it's a too high price love : she initiates him into drugs. Actually they made an album with the film music, no fan can miss it! Actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Grünberg are very convincing. "" Together they search for sun and exoticism.",1
"It was an even bigger surprise to find that it is a pretty good movie. Why does Stefan take heroin? Maybe now I can appreciate it on the album, now that I have some visuals to accompany it in my mind. And the use of the soundtrack music, which as far as I can tell is exclusively by Pink Floyd, is excellent.",1
Pink Floyd score. Sort of Jean Seberg with a hypodermic. Great sex scenes too.,1
"Yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars. < br / > < br / > Rarely has something free been so worth invaluable. I chose Goodtimes DVD's four DVD collection of the series.",1
This movie is amazing. It's a target.,1
"It is the 20th century version of the 300 Spartans. In an ironic twist amid the devastation caused by German air attacks Beethoven's Seventh Symphony is employed to underscore the visual suffering. With all of mainland Europe under his control Hitler prepares for the last obstacle in his way before heading for North America, Great Britain. With an overwhelming edge in aircraft Goering's Luftwaffe looks unstoppable on paper. The story itself is one of remarkable courage by a defiant nation who refused to buckle under to the devastating attacks inflicted upon it by up until that point an invincible war machine.",1
"< br / > < br / > Yet the Nazis were stunned and stymied as well. It was a turning point, forcing Hitler to rethink his strategy.",1
"So, then, is it true that something such as The Frozen Limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non British audience? The Frozen Limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as The Crazy Gang. With the anarchic "" not "" so wild west make over an absolute winner. I feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there's some very talented people at work here. 8 / 10 They were a group of British entertainers who formed in the early 1930s. < br / > < br / > Now then, dose the Mounties always get their man? Not all the comedy works, and in truth the "" big 6 "" are trumped big time by a film stealing Moore Marriott.",1
"Off they go to the Yukon and The Frozen Limits. The jokes are also strictly topical British and a lot just wouldn't be gotten over here. < br / > < br / > By the way, it's case of misplaced Chamberlains. It will be worth it. I can see Stan Laurel making the same mistake.",1
"< br / > < br / > A British - made Western is a rarity, but a British Western spoof is rarer still ( CARRY ON COWBOY [ 1965 ] was still some 25 years away ).",1
"to Brits and ex - pats interested in seeing'30's British b & w comedies. He outlived them all by years. Baddie Bill "" M "" McGrew wants it himself however.",1
This little short absolutely fascinates me.,1
"However, it isn't.",1
Each story is uplifting its own unique way! A story about experience and vulnerability!,1
< br / > < br / > Good news!,1
Tan as lead is nothing less than magnificent. His choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. Tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad.,1
It all seemed so real.,1
"And maybe, in 10 years it might have become the common speech of the youth. I gave 9 of 10 points. ( God forbid! ) Erkan & Stefan are assigned to become bodyguards for the beautiful Nina.",1
Everyone else - it'worth viewing!,1
I was laughing all time through. Great movie. Why?,1
The high quality of picture and cut support the movie a lot.,1
"The jokes are good, but some Germans might find their accents off - putting.",1
"She does sensual, beautiful and menacing to the power of 10. < br / > < br / > All in all, a remarkable vampire movie.",1
It's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice. One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead. Where are the yellow contacts? The soundtrack is excellent. What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects.,1
"don't expect anything, like i said, just see it for yourself and you know what i mean. why?",1
"Hand of Death is not Jackie and Sammo's usual kung fu comedy. Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well. Many people believe, or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising, that this is a Jackie Chan film.",1
"Akasha's head got knocked off in 1 sec and Lestat turned into the biggest punk in the world. In Queen of The Damned, Akasha ( Aaliyah ) was more sexy and had a bigger, demanding presence, she just caught your eye and attention. REST IN PEACE AALIYAH now the movie did have faults, like the lack of explaining Akasha's past.",1
"When he becomes a popular movie icon his fellow vampires, understadebly, go mad and plot his death. When Lestat holds a concert in Death Valley he receives news that not only will angry vampires be there Akasha may come as well. Join Her Or Die? With Lestat tempted with royality and loving care by Akasha ancient vampires consisting of Marius and Jesses Aunt Maharet ( Lena Olin ) plot against them. She goes to a vampire coven, a bar, and kills everyone in her path. I quite this Anne Rice book adaption. Meanwhile Akasha has other plans. Jesse is given Lestats diary and reads of his first killing and an encounter with the Queen of the Damned - Akasha ( Aaliyah ).",1
"Absolutely no loyalty to the books at all. If you have read book then you have every right to hate this movie. It's amazing! Personally, I LOVED TRIS MOVIE!",1
"Anyway, I seriously suggest you watch it. ! My Rating is defiantly : 10 out of 10.",1
"The scenes are very rich, and it moves very quickly.",1
The music was excellent.,1
The relationships portrayed in the film were very sexy and sizzling. Loved this story and film. Casting is wonderful.,1
LOL.,1
It was an all around good movie. It's not a children'movie. I've seen a lot too.,1
"Actually it is a complement. But please don't compare it to the "" Interview "" movie. The movie, although not faithful to the original novels, succeeds in creating modern gothic vampire vision. But Akasha's death was very nice. I loved Jesse, Maharet and Marius though.",1
"And I found this movie a faithful and often superlative representation of the author'vision. Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main players ( and Jesse of the Talamasca ). Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.",1
It's like a frickin'drug. All in all it was a good time at the movies. Take it as that.,1
Interview is Louis'story.,1
"The characters are nothing compared to the ones established in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. The extravagance needed in many scenes is not given, and the dialog is tiring. < br / > < br / > The acting in QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was moderate, if disappointing. < br / > < br / > This movie doesn't give all that it appears to be. The scenes of sensuality were also atmospherically satisfying. The effects are dull and very disappointing.",1
"If vampire tales are your cup of blood, then this Goth - fest based on the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience. < br / > < br / > Make no mistake, this is Les A veritable consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting, ` Queen of the Damned,'directed by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness, and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity. And they are not going for the music. Toward that end he becomes the front man for a band - - a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known.",1
The acting is great and the storyline enthralling. Surface is one of the greatest t. v. series I have seen.,1
"Infuriating.. Two that come to mind immediately are "" Surface "", and "" Odyssey 5 "". And I think it is here. The show holds the attention. Alas, the series crashed after season one, so we never get a resolution.",1
True Love. I just saw it on DVD. Tasha Smith was a Blast!,1
"In many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence. And unfortunately, he could have cared less. As a result of the extreme misogyny in the movie, most Western audience members will be shocked or at least be emotionally pulled into the plight of the ladies in this film. This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning Sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband.",1
"Tons of action, suspense, science fiction, etc.",1
Is this a new evolution coming about? What is waiting for us beneath the waters of the world.,1
"I can't wait for the return of "" Surface "".",1
"< br / > < br / > A really great, class show. He was a stroke of genius. It takes the invasion theme in somewhat different directions, but has done it in a very exciting way.",1
"< br / > < br / > FYC Morningbear Right now the reruns on Sci - Fi, marathons, will have to do. I for one would love to see where story goes after the tsunami that ended Episode 15. I am sorry to see that SURFACE has not been picked up for the NBC 2006 - 2007 season.",1
"I loved it, sometimes I had to call home and tell my mom to tape it for me.",1
"No filler episodes, which put a pain in your side when you missed an episode. Plus, it felt like it was NBC's attempt at a "" Lost - killer "". That trait of the show, though shows how great it is. Yes.",1
Those who miss the X - Files just may have a worthy successor. < br / > < br / > PS : I just heard it got axed from NBC... Here'hoping Sci - Fi picks it up.,1
? Anyone know when they will resume season?,1
I enjoyed the story.,1
I am a big fan of Surface. Did he have a grouth spert? ( I bet ABC was chocking ) Ha!,1
Did the Olympics kill surface? I really enjoyed the show along with my family.,1
"I hope there's a lot of people out there that feel the same way. When i started watching "" Surface "" for the first time i was hooked. My whole family loved to watch the show. When i watch TV now i only watch good shows so right now thats not watching a whole lot of TV.",1
And scifi. It keeps my attention.,1
"Come on NBC, just give Surface one more season!",1
": ) To my chagrin, I found out it had been canceled after a mere 15 episodes, despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews. I just wish the show's creators were given a fair chance. Just fantastic from start to finish, and as another reviewer commented, I LOVED how they ended every episode with a huge finish. Such a shame.",1
"And there wasn't single sour note struck acting - wise, either ; some surprisingly solid casting, here. All things considered, a job very well done.",1
"Wow! Strange, unusual, and brilliant.",1
"he was fine! Essence held it down for her girl, when she needed her. Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. They both look good together and they both pulled it off. Damn!",1
"< br / > < br / > 95 % of the sheep watching TV don't want to rack their brains. The problem with TV today is that people have been spoiled by "" lite "" TV viewing. They want excuses to not think.",1
! The actor who plays Miles is great.,1
"And as long as things stay this vague there is a fair amount of tension and suspense. < br / > < br / > Miles Bennett ( Carter Jenkins ) is a Wilmington teenager who finds some strange eggs floating in the ocean. A human element is introduced in the form of three American families, one on each coast and one on the Gulf of Mexico. He takes one home where it hatches into an "" ET "" type dragon. etc. I found the first 7 episodes ( Discs 1 and 2 ) extremely engaging and the remainder a disappointment. "" This DVD set is the complete widescreen 15 - episode run of "" Surface "", a television show made by Universal in 2006.",1
You have a great concept and it could be a whole lot more. Quit dragging it on and on.,1
"I am continuously amazed at the US networks. They should learn that like fine wines and cheeses, they take time to mature. ! Why oh why did the pull the plug on this? This show had everything. It just doesn't make sense.",1
There was plenty of story line left to build on and lots of unanswered questions. I love this show. I was under the impression it was going to have more seasons. I think they really dropped the ball on this one.,1
"Then, the show ended too soon, since the Olympics were coming and hey! This is one of the better sci - fi series. In the end the suits did it. So they only did 15 episodes instead of the expected 22.",1
"Sci - fi on TV is difficult. There is no denying it. is what makes or breaks a show like this one. But aside from these flaws it's an enjoyable show. So does "" Surface "" succeed? The ending for me is not that appealing.",1
To my surprise I enjoyed this darkhorse movie.,1
I suggest seeing it.,1
Did I write ten lines yet? Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. I give Armored eight out of ten. Nope! Not a Christmas movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > Along the way, they bond and learn from each other. It's on Lifetime. This is the first dumb thing - were there no ATMs anywhere? She must make a fortune.",1
"Now I like Victor Herbert. He was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing. She performed well, but movie audiences didn't take to her. The recordings I have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet. Sakall as Irish, HELLO.",1
"There is an abundance of this. But in the 1930's, would that have been a box office draw? I remember the shivers running up and down my spine.",1
"In the changing world of CG and what - not of cartoon animations etc. etc., Faeries was a warm welcome at least by me. Call me old - fashioned but I liked it.",1
"I love this movie, but it is so scary!",1
"Your standard - issue motley assortment of intrepid boneheads - - hectoring hard - nosed mine boss, cute, but insipid blonde babe, feisty lady geologist, boozy, inexplicably Aussie - accented (! )",1
"The film does build in intensity towards a pretty good ending. Now, the characters aren't too interesting nor the actors either.",1
If you saw the movie Money Train and enjoyed that you would love this movie.,1
"The bottom line. Of the three, Dan is the one with the greatest in - the - field training as a reporter. How many bucks will our news division deliver for the network? Sure, they had to pay lip - service attention to their ratings, if only to please their bosses. All of which has nothing to do with why all three are actually IN those jobs. To do all that takes real talent, something Mr. J. Brooks has in abundance. Or maybe not. Same goes for John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. But all they REALLY cared about was THE NEWS ITSELF.",1
"Grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and Altman resigns prior to being fired. This new ( news ingnorant ) guy coaching him? One could learn from critical viewings of this movie. Altman knows all news stories, inside and out. Tom immediately charms people with humbleness. They don't listen to her.",1
"Remember, this was pre - cable!",1
I loved this movie the first time I saw it.,1
"A great, underrated movie. But of course, it's not that simplistic. The movie is hilarious as well, every scenekewers society.",1
"Broadcast news doesn't have < br / > < br / > three, it has twice that. I love this movie for many reasons.",1
"Not everybody's life ends well, and it shows in Broadcast News. Awesome! "" Broadcast News is a classic in it's time, and a fine romance movie up there with "" Casablanca "". Typically, I'm a comedy guy. Well, maybe not that high, but it's only other romance I can think of that I like. and rented it. < br / > < br / > Boy, was I wrong.",1
"< br / > < br / > Finally, the rest of the cast is great, too.",1
The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick. He is the slightly aloof ex - sportscaster who is the new reporter. Jane's and Aaron's trip to Central America.,1
This is a decent movie. I would recommend this movie.,1
"And ending of the movie I find to be so very, very sad. ).",1
"< br / > < br / > Wiliam Hurt's performance is less showy. She was robbed! The scales literally fall from her eyes. She is also hilariously neurotic. Tom Grunick and his clones are well and truly alive! Yet, it predicted the dumbing down of the news. Her performance is perfect. This is Hunter's film. ).",1
i thought it was terrific!,1
The rub comes when Tom reveals he is about to join her news bureau in Washington. Aaron Altman ( Brooks ) is Jane's highly intelligent reporter colleague and confidante. < br / > < br / > This is where most of the bite comes from with well - observed comment and scenes.,1
"< br / > < br / > All in all, definitely a movie that I recommend.",1
"... there was "" Broadcast News, "" and what a good thing it was. Fortunately, they're few and far between. < br / > < br / > A legitimate classic.",1
"The highlight of the movie for me, was Albert Brooks speech on the devil. I give this a 7 out of 10.",1
Network's style of satire feels more extreme and guerrilla. Broadcast News { dir. In my mind it succeeds on both levels on its own terms.,1
"Holly, having rejected both men, remains caught between them. Do we condemn game? < br / > < br / > It's a cute ending, but compared to "" Network "" the film seems positively trite. They're defenders of the public good.",1
< br / > < br / > Fast moving popcorn action film has a great deal going with it. Worth a look. It cranks everything up and just goes.,1
"He knows he's only capable of looking good, but is not a reporter. Subtle line in a brilliantly written low - key comedy, a farce about the show biz aspect of TV anchoring. In this unpredictable comedy, there's no telling who Hunter ( neurotic heroine ) will end up with. Brooks tells her that Hurt is the wrong one because he represents everything she's against. All in all, seven well deserved Oscar nominations.",1
"It was number 64 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. The comedy is subtle but strong, the romance has it's moments, and it is certainly a believable situation film. Very good! The network prepares for big changes, and sparks will fly with all members of the studio.",1
0 out of 10 < br / > < br / > 7. Certainly not for everyone.,1
Holly Hunter is stunning. < br / > < br / > William Hurt has never been better. < br / > < br / > Watch this with NETWORK for a truly fun and frightening evening.,1
James L. Brook is one of those directors who always seems to take a quirky look at life.,1
"My appetite keeps saying, "" Something like BROADCAST NEWS. "" That's what I want. Great, great work.",1
"The course instructors impressed on us that TV news was a "" branch of show - biz "". And make sure you don't sweat on camera. Never mind journalistic integrity, what counts is the ability to look good and smile nicely.",1
! I highly recommend this film.,1
Holly Hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer. Its also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance.,1
"Short I have recently only remembered him in "" Stomp the Yard "" which was about a kid who lost his brother and lives his dream to go to college. Although the plan sounds safe at first, greed isn't everything when it comes to taking lives. This movie is about six men who are assigned to transport money from bank to businesses.",1
I was up late last night and couldn't fall asleep. There is nothing wasted in Schaffner's effort. This film made me realize he's a good actor. Because this film was very good. Now I understand why this movie was so good. This was a really nice surprise.,1
The comedic timing of the actors is also very strong.,1
Lots of fun.,1
You gotta love the spaghetti western universe. I find that a bit dodgy as far as descriptions go. It's a beautiful movie. A lot of people call Corbucci's films'depressing '.,1
"Incidentally, the anachronistic addition of a bunch of long - haired youths ( who also engage in dope - smoking and revolutionary talk ) is a somewhat half - baked attempt at contemporary relevance but it all eventually adds to the fun ( besides, even the black barmaid sports an Afro hairdo! ).",1
"It's not desert western, shot in the alps somewhere, and is lovely to look at. Sylvie Fennec is lovely as Sheba, who may be Hud's niece, or dead brother's girlfriend... that's never made clear. Three of these, all except THE SPECIALISTS, are constantly turning up on ten best lists when spaghetti westerns are rated.",1
"Yes, oddly. It's good. Good, boring or bad?",1
"This film has "" Euro "" written all over it.",1
"as well as the "" decent "" citizens that lynched Bret's brother.",1
< br / > < br / > I hope that he finds her.,1
Is she OK? Can he say goodbye?,1
It is clear this film's value far supersedes the cost with which the format ( mini - dv ) implies.,1
"Michael's desire to find Grace is completely selfish. He is a real character. What went wrong? We would not be in them otherwise. Our best gauge on the relationship is through his friend, Nadia. Which is exactly why I liked him.",1
"See the movie, you'll understand why.",1
"And out of the order, meaning. < br / > < br / > The commentary saves this movie. The concept of this film is very original. Michaels relationship is shown from every point whether it's a high or low. His monologues are often overdrawn and pointless.",1
But everyone did fine job. This is a very Freudian psycho - thriller. Carax has a minimalist style. There is a lot going on between the lines in this film. That is really my favorite kind of filmmaking. I thought the cult stuff was great.,1
"Nope. Guns, lots of guns. They unapologetically made guy movies. No skirts need apply. Dueling armored trucks? Bloody gunshot wounds? Get a dog. < br / > < br / > Matt Dillon cajoles, pleads, persuades the holdout.",1
Seriously. Never have I been so angry at a main character.,1
"After such a movie you can't do another one in the same point of view. So Leos Carax has to changed, and he did.",1
"Frankly, I expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent French movie. I was wrong. Pola X is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience.",1
"< br / > < br / > And Isabelle, who is she really??",1
"It's best I've seen all year. You will, I hope, be rewarded in the same way that I was. It will leave you with 1, 000 thoughts, each of them at once troublesome and thrilling. Pola X is a beautiful adaption of Herman Melville's'Pierre ; or, the Ambiguities '.",1
"This movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end. Consequently, if you are not into tragedies, this is not your movie. Overall I give this movie a 7. If these sorts of things don't impress you, skip it.",1
"This is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently. So many people hated this film! But then, Carax is extreme, that we know.",1
"< br / > < br / > And no. I've just seen it... and liked it. < br / > < br / > The film needs some patience, yes.",1
"I hope more people discover this tantalizing film. which, of course, he wasn't. His version of a Victorian romance was a twisted, cynical one, perhaps, but brilliant in its synthesis. The alternate title : "" The ambiguities "" is quite appropriate. Newspapers even published headlines like : "" Melville Insane! "" As he searches for happiness, he becomes more and more miserable.",1
"It's a sad story, I suppose, but the kind that leaves you feeling better, not blue.",1
"I only wish I could have seen more into Terri's life before film ended. : ) I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this film.",1
"Especially today. Overall, a well done movie. Or the French speaking in English. < br / > < br / > Why in English? India is complicated. And fails pretty miserably at that. The Ramayana is an epic.",1
"The film is a tribute to Huston'genius. He has taken a small, beautiful story and has made a small, beautiful movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > But "" The Dead "" belies its title. It is not a dark story. < br / > < br / > To claim that Huston has softened his writer's criticism of society again misses the mark. John Huston made many remarkable and memorable films. I tend to think that it is.",1
and I will be watching it again soon. I wasn't really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little away. In fact the rest of the film continued to give little away! < br / > < br / > 9 out of 10.,1
"Then some, believe that they hear it, but they don't. The Argentinian music poet, Atahualpa Yupanqui, once said that some folk music repeats similarly at any country of the world.",1
"As with The Red Badge of Courage and The Man Who Would Be King, Huston revered the literary source but made the adaptation cinematic. All of us slogged through Portrait of an Artist in school, and one needs to bring the maturity of appreciating how words and images in and of themselves can touch us. It's fitting that John Huston, who held back in attempting to film this story, ended his career with it. And with "" The Dead "" ( which was completed after Huston's death by his son, Tony Huston ) we get something nearly perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema.",1
"This is a haunting short film. This is first rate from beginning to end. Beautifully shot, acted, edited. I am so glad I got to see it.",1
This is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays.,1
"It is truly a masterpiece of tact, subtlety and overwhelming beauty.",1
The cast is excellent as well as the camerawork.,1
"If anyone has insights to share on topic I'd be interested to hear more. Huston made a career of adapting great works of literature to film, usually quite successfully.",1
"But somehow, Huston gets it right, and he manages a nearly flawless adaptation.",1
"It is about love, loss and regret, those stable mainstays of great drama. < br / > < br / > But then all the performances are extraordinary.",1
"Thinking about it now, I still can't of anything I'd criticise it for. Huston just knew how to tell a good story.",1
"Easily one of my three or four favorite films. Rather, it glows warm and welcoming. The film is not horrifying. Definitely one for the desert island. It is not depressing. There is nothing ` brilliant'about this film.",1
"You can just feel her despair permeating the room. It's mostly filmed using hand - held cameras, which gets a bit distracting. < br / > < br / > But, the movie isn't perfect.",1
"The film is short, only 83 minutes. The film is a family affair.",1
It's a short movie for such immense feelings.,1
An exquisite film. They just don't make them like this any more!,1
John Huston did a magnificent job. So many literary adaptations are disappointments.,1
"My wife is from Dublin, we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every January 6th.",1
"( Indeed, that scene could play well as a short. )",1
"Admittedly, warmth and affection emanate from the songs and the meal, complete with turkey and pudding. But the passage of time has partly ruined Julia's voice, first crack in the mirror. Only some poor things, yellowish photographs, bibelots and trinklets.... But are a human being's hopes and dreams all fulfilled? Look at Gretta. Maybe an unfulfilled life, because she remained a spinster, with no children to carry on. The party doesn't delude people for long.",1
10 out of 10. This is my favourite movie of all time.,1
It's like Phantasm's retarded cousin.,1
The acting is amazing. Both Franco and Mine have that element and it shows.,1
"< br / > < br / > ( In fact, this version isn't so special after all. < br / > < br / > Note! Commentary track is interesting. < br / > < br / > Great date - movie! There's no bad language or nudity in it what so ever. Originally made in 1981, stayed on the shelves for a couple of years before release. Too bad! ) The film was aimed to teenagers, but this must be the goriest PG - rated film ever. There is definitely a certain feel to this 80's horror genre. Yes, we got nightmares. It's campy, utterly stupid, but they just can't make these movies anymore.",1
This movie creeped the hell out of me as a kid ( mausoleums still do! ).,1
"< br / > < br / > 7 out of 10, kids. I enjoyed it and it scared my girlfriend.",1
Plus Elizabeth Daily is adorable. Highly under - appreciated.,1
"There is no "" Who done it? "" Horror!",1
"< br / > < br / > The first thing I noticed was how slowly this movie builds. I didn't know anything about this movie before I watched it. It doesn't do the typical setup of showing characters being murdered one by one. It seems to be a lesser - known teen horror from the 80's. I don't need to own it, but I'm glad I discovered it.",1
"A friend found it via online search. < br / > < br / > The final 20 minutes or so of One Dark Night are what make it so memorable. The rotting, worm - riddled corpses look quite real. The original negative was not available for the DVD transition. It is of the teen fright variety yet the teens are respectable in their own ways. Attention was afforded to great detail in the final scenes. < br / > < br / > The story builds over the course of the film.",1
Meg plays an outcast teenager who is just dying to get into the good graces of some classic mean girls. < br / > < br / > This little film is different. They tell her she can be part of their little group if she spends the night in a crypt.,1
7 out of 10.,1
"It brings back all the memories. The theme tune was great too, i get goosebumps whenever i hear it. hello all Denver fans!",1
"What more could you want from an early 80's horror film? Unless, of course, Raymar got his eyes on it. I know that's what I do if there's a remake of a film I haven't seen before. Creepy setting. Enjoy. Well, sorry.",1
Dead all with their eyes wide open in a closet.,1
"Their initiation for her consists of spending the night in a mausoleum. Her hubby ( Adam West, of Batman fame ) is there to laugh and scoff, and not much else. And it would also seem that he has a thing for jail bait. 7 out of 10.",1
"One Dark Night "" was completed some time before its release to theaters in 1983, where it actually did decent business during its first few weeks. < br / > < br / > Tilly is cute and appealing in her role, having recently completed her debut film work in "" Tex "" before joining this production. """,1
I thought that One Dark Night was great! This movie is a definite star among horror flicks of the 80's. It deserves a 10!,1
"As you know, these types are buried without fanfare. Don't get me started on the cavernous silence. Even Ramar himself looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric, perverted old man. This is my favorite horror film, a close 2nd to'Poltergeist '. Kudos! He's selling real estate in Texas now.",1
"The mausoleum makes for an impressively vast and unsettling main location. However, I nonetheless still found this flawed fright flick to be oddly appealing and entertaining. give this picture a certain endearingly quaint 80's period charm.",1
< br / > < br / > My rating : 7 out of 10.,1
I loved it then & I still love it. The storyline revolves around two people.,1
"= : ) Oh, how I miss the 80's cartoons!! thepetitionsite. Heya Denver fans!",1
"One Dark Night has a typical teen horror film set - up with a quite a unique twist. Also, great ending tension going in on the dark crypt opening. The special effects are excellent, though dated. Maybe someday it will be located.",1
"Sheba Baby "" casts Grier as stylist Chicago gumshoe Sheba Shayne.",1
"The plot itself is nothing In other words, Shark's ass is grass.. can you dig it? I can just imagine the enthusiasm he must've had getting Pam Grier, quite a hot item, to star in his picture. ! Sheba will get her revenge on all those responsible for his father's death.",1
"it is more exciting than Coffy, more action.",1
"So Sheba Baby is Pam's film, through and through. Not that Pam doesn't kick - butt in Sheba Baby.",1
"Rent the DVD, and then tell me I'm wrong. Can't, can you?",1
"There are clocks without hands. As usual in the "" European authors'movies "". I thought it would be more fantastic a tale. There is a vision of his happy family in the country.",1
Destiny can be altered - and death deferred - through the characters'choices. < br / > < br / > One New Year's Eve Holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion. It's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film.,1
"At death's door, she requests, "" Send for David Holm! "" Once upon a time, in Sweden, there was a poor Salvation Army sister. But, Victor Sjöström ( as David Holm ) cannot be located, because he is spending New Year's Eve in a graveyard, with his drinking buddies.",1
That's it for that kind of gag.,1
The pacing does becomes tedious with its overly familiar Dickensian narrative. This would be Sjostrom's final performance as an actor. Most of the great Bergman themes are here on full display. It's a genuinely creepy and frightening film for youngsters for sure. * * * of 4 stars.,1
"It has a wonderfully eerie atmosphere. If you can find a copy of this, I highly recommend giving it a watch.",1
< br / > < br / > Some viewers look at this film as a horror film which it certainly is not. In America he was known as Victor Seastrom. The first version is the Swedish edit under the title of THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE. This is a morality play with shades of the supernatural used to hit home its stark message. The Grapevine Video release is an excellent way to do this.,1
How nightmarish. < br / > < br / > How bleak. Incredible. How full of despair.,1
"The idea of the Grim Reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative. That's pretty amazing. Am I missing something? On one hand, you have to respect it because for 1921, it's a very good film. < br / > < br / > As far as this film goes, it's a very mixed bag. Plus, some of the story elements just don't make sense.",1
"Fulfilled with her spirit, they get to David's wife and children. Together, they drive to the stations where people live who suffered from David. Meanwhile, the Phantom Carriage is approaching. They also visit David's brother, who has committed a murder after having been seduced into drinking by David. But her unconditioned love to David will save his soul. Deplorably, it is still not available on international DVD. Since David refuses to get on the carriage, Georges forces him.",1
The message comes across as very powerful and effective. It's of course a story that concentrates on morals and it does this very well. < br / > < br / > This is a movie that is made great by its story.,1
"Little does he know, however, that he will not be alive to greet it. On a dark, gloomy New Year's Eve night, an ill nurse, her life slowly ebbing away, demands that David Holm be presented to her at once. < br / > < br / > To pass the time, Holm cheerfully recites a ghost story.",1
"My vote is nine. When David denies to visit Edit, his friends have an argument with him, they fight and David dies.",1
"Inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise, from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy, etc. That part was not much, and ended on a somewhat stupid note. A lot of the humor is topical, so it pays to know who "" Little Egypt "" and other characters.",1
"com / film / film. when they interact with the "" live "" people ) are EXCELLENT! html nvogel. < br / > < br / > The double - exposure effects of the ghosts ( esp.",1
< br / > < br / > Striking imagery abounds throughout The Phantom Carriage and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue. This is a must - see. Victor Sjostrom's silent film masterpiece The Phantom Carriage has recently been released on DVD with a new soundtrack recorded by KTL.,1
"Most strikingly, the carriage travels to the floor of the ocean to collect the soul of a person who drowned.",1
Most highly recommend. Try to rent it or find it on - line.,1
"This film is a masterpiece to put it simply. It is now his turn to take over. < br / > < br / > The film is about the danger ofbusing drugs, in this case alcohol. There is a new soul - collector to be appointed every year.",1
"< br / > < br / > 9. Or even a crappy budget release. Sjostrom gave a convincing performance as the drunken, mean - spirited and frightening David Holm. The penultimate scene is as dark as any I have seen in all of cinema. One of the best silent dramas I've seen. No camera mugging and no unintentional laughs due to wild - eyed arm - waving histrionics. It just needs to be out there so people can see and appreciate it.",1
"Okay, so this wasnt what I was expecting. But when I watched it I realized that it was very funny. So if you like to laugh rent this one. But, this film had B - movie all over it.",1
"Some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure. But Jack Frost 2 won't go over well with some people. The next woman fell on a bed of icicles. "". Well, you have to see it for yourself.",1
"They say that Sam's DNA combined with Jack Frost's. Now he is immune to anti - freeze. Hence, here's my point. 7 out of 10. The screenplay was, was also atrocious. The first one was better though. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie. Since the main character is allergic to bananas, Jack Frost is too.",1
"< br / > < br / > This movie has it all. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with him. Yes, killer snowballs. YARRR! And finally, Captain Fun. This is the sequel to Jack Frost, a movie about a killer snowman. like babies.",1
"In other words, go see! A woman "" May "" is hounded by a man "" Eddie "" ( played by Sam Shepard ).",1
"< br / > < br / > The lack of "" memorable quotes "" disturbs me. But you have to understand, IT'S NOT A HORROR MOVIE. Jack Frost 2 is neither of these.",1
Dare i say osca winner. This is a perfect date movie.,1
"If you liked JACK FROST, then you will like this sequel. They looked like hand puppets. Seeing old friends and meeting new characters.",1
This is better then the first.,1
"< br / > < br / > Bottom line incredible movie, rent it. "".",1
"This movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt. Okay, I'll say it. It certainly worked for me.",1
"I like José Coronado in this movie, he offered us a good performance, as the rest of the crew. I suppose this movie is not your typical Spanish thriller as it is based in a real story that took place abroad.",1
"Despite that the movie is still funny, exiting and involving. 5 out of 10.",1
You'll want to know how this story ends once you start watching. It kept me on the edge of my seat.,1
"One thing "" Nobody's Life "" has that "" Time Out "" definitely lacked was a love interest apart from the protagonist's trusting wife. Thus, one could feel the tension mounting in "" Nobody's Life "" and the violent conclusion coming. Of course, how could he. It's too bad because this movie is pretty good on its own, with good acting and writing.",1
"The perfect storyline he has carefully built all along these years will start closing around him all of a sudden. A good deal of Spanish movies have interesting stories but are far from technical proficiency. Emilio is a successful business man, a perfect father and a good husband. < br / > < br / > Well done. Will he be able to keep up with his own lies? Or that is what everybody think. Can we keep up?",1
"By comparison, Truffaut is a provincial bore with nothing to say. They are Gods and Goddesses. François Truffaut, Young Jerk of the "" Cahiers du cinema "", main bastion of the coming so - called New Wave, made a big show of hating this film and even accused it of dragging French cinema into mediocrity.",1
"< br / > < br / > The cast is rather good, Laurent Terzieff as an existentialist cynic and Andréa Parisy as a rich kid are the stand - outs. Very few grown - ups appear anyway. They are all smile, too sweet and to nice to be believable. But this disenchantment you feel throughout the whole movie is really disturbing. When you know what the priests of this cinema school ( the likes of Godard ) thought of Carné, it's really a good joke. < br / > < br / > Oddly, "" les tricheurs "" was labeled "" nouvelle vague ""!",1
"He is almost thirty years older than his young stars, and it shows. He really can be a puzzle for me. I think perhaps his inspiration left him a little earlier than it did for other directors of his generation. I blow hot and cold over Carné.",1
"It went deep into me and stirred my bowels. First, I rated this movie 10 / 10. I saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and I still remember it!",1
"There is also a fine jazz score, which you can get on the CD JAZZ IN PARIS - - JAZZ & CINEMA VOL. 2. For this American viewer ( I watched a dubbed, fairly literally I'd say, version of this titled THE CHEATERS ), the film provides an interesting window into the France of the 1950s.",1
"The beautiful? Could it be the moral character? Who is the "" bad "" crowd? As far as movie goes, the cast worked together as if it were predestined.",1
It was very believable and engaging.,1
Love that.,1
"The movie was hilarious. So many people exclaim at the end, wow! < br / > < br / > If you haven't watched it. I am not a loser? Do so.",1
Check it out DVD!,1
"Highly recommended. My wife had to leave the room. However, this movie is not for everyone.",1
I highly recommend picture.,1
One intense situation after another kept me glued to the set. He just steals every scene that he is in. This could be my favorite grown up Corey performance. Bravo. I strongly recommend this film for anyone looking to break a sweat.,1
"Go get this one! For that alone, I rate this film a 10!",1
"I love this film. I saw this on "" Showtime "" while channel surfing. It was a pleasant surprise.",1
"Very intense! Anyways, Brian does it.",1
Impressive.,1
High.,1
Overall good episode a strange one though about a supernatural phone still it's suspenseful and it twists well at the end.,1
"Joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a particular female voice which will haunt her. The fate of Beth might just tell the viewer why Joan is being traumatized. Without help from the manager, Joan will decide to find out for herself who is causing her such anguish. < br / > < br / > The episode, I think, is a tour - de - force for Jean Marsh who is a one woman show. I think, though, that the build - up to it works rather well.",1
"I guess it did, sort of, with Fall. At least it was for me. That look in Hepplewhite's eye! Quite a performance, I think.",1
"Not as good as the Evil Dead but a close second. This one is full of blood, guts and gore. It has everything you would want to see in a horror movie. The makings of a real cult classic.",1
Absolutely worth checking out.,1
Definitely worth checking out.,1
"Seen it all before, yeah right. The incest jokes are a little predictable but funny nonetheless. This is something i have become quite used to... haven't we all. And the way brother bob meets his end is more than classic. That truck is amazing! The end of this move simply could not have been better. But now i'm satisfied that at least it won't be too terrible.",1
"The final moments are a trifle weak as well. Sure it doesn't measure up to the classic gory comedies, but this still does fine. Director Michael Davis even manages one or two creepy scenes, such as in the bathroom, or the bar.",1
"I watched it, not really expecting much from an obviously low budget production. I laughed myself sick!",1
"to keep him in check. Just got around to seeing Monster Man yesterday. That's it. This was a horror comedy that actually worked. Hidden in backseat of his station wagon, is good buddy Harley.",1
The Direction is very good!. < br / > < br / > There is a lot of gore!. < br / > < br / > The Acting is very good for a low budget film.,1
"But they don't listen. 7 out of 10. Still the complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive. Did I mention that Aimee Brooks is sexy? Big mistake! """,1
He was just divine in this film. Great low - budget Horror Comedy.,1
"It deserves more attention in the big screen. < br / > < br / > Yes, the plot somewhat generic as possible. Something that the director has shown and delivers. It proves that big budget doesn't make an effective horror movie, but skill does! Throw in a little buddy - comedy, nice gore and intense scare. It's hard no to say that Monster Man is really entertaining.",1
"You will absolutely LOVE it! Trust me, you will love this movie.",1
< br / > < br / > Pretty good horror film. I give it a. It's also a horror comedy. Who is doing this and why?,1
"Adam has broken off with the inconvenient and moron Harley because of Betty - Ann. < br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) : "" Monster Man My vote is seven.",1
only problem with the film is the unbelievable hero role played by eric jungmann. he is identical to jack black. justin urich is a comic gem and should have a very promising career.,1
No. It was still a really nice movie. Was it a bit predictable? Go rent it.,1
"< br / > < br / > The End. Definite worth watching, but don't take it seriously. In addition, the FX were high - quality. Instead, I found a comedy / gore classic.",1
"It's a simple, straight forward laugh fest. This film offered some hilarious and sickening set pieces.",1
"Adam is a wussy virgin, while Harley is a fat big - mouthed "" A - hole "". Just when you think the film couldn't possibly get any messier, things take a turn for the weird in the final third. Things start out worryingly as we're introduced to two characters, both irritating in different ways.",1
"They also pick up a hitchhiker, played by the very sexy Aimee Brooks. < br / > < br / > I'm really surprised this movie didn't get a wide theatrical release. His ex - best friend tags along and rags on him constantly.",1
"Gaming? Well, really! Nutbourne is a school for boys. "" Fisticuffs? Decameron Nights! says Pond. "" he asks one of the early girls. """,1
"< br / > < br / > It's an old cliché I know, but they really don't make them like that anymore. If you haven t seen it, please do, you won't be disappointed. How I wish they did. It simply could not go wrong with the cast of superb British character actors it boasts. < br / > < br / > Where to start?",1
"< br / > < br / > All interior shots took place at Riverside studios in Hammersmith, London.",1
A definite must - see.,1
It's too smart for that.,1
"< br / > < br / > 7 / 10 Margaret Rutherford, Alastair Sim and - most especially! Good for silly, harmless giggle. ).",1
Why 9 / 10? Only 83mins long. Absolutely brilliant.,1
The plot is simple : A ministry mistake billets a girls'school on a boys'school. I will always laugh when I think of this film. ).,1
It has a lot of clips from them playing in concert.,1
"The most kick ass song they made is also on there ( Sic ). The "" My Plague "" video was shot there and is included on the DVD.",1
I did it too.,1
This DVD usually sells for around $ 20. < br / > < br / > Seven out of ten.,1
I wish I knew the group's name so that I could look for it somewhere in cyberspace. This is one of the most enjoyable teen movies I have ever seen ( and that I wished was released to video ).,1
"Rusty "" was delightful.",1
"In this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again. 1984 was the last time I saw that film, until about a month ago. He was great! < br / > < br / > As I stated earlier I am Lambert fan, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. I was Tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it ( climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds ).",1
Not to mention the scenery of the film.,1
"Of course there are others who don't welcome the new heir back in society. As for the language of love, Tarzan and Jane need no lessons. I've been assured by experts. The most popular Holmes was Basil Rathbone, the most popular Tarzan was Johnny Weissmuller. < br / > < br / > For Burroughs purists, Greystoke is the real deal. < br / > < br / > But Greystoke is the real deal, a faithful adaption of Burroughs first story concerning the origin of his hero.",1
"The story line in the movie was that she was an American cousin. The last time I checked Carolina was in the USA. < br / > < br / > Great sending point for Sir Richardson, he did steal the movie. I have seen most of the Tarzan episodes. He viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach. She did not have to resort to Bo's level.",1

I have seen most of the Tarzan episodes. He viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach. She did not have to resort to Bo's level.",1
"The only bad points I found were, I think, related. Makes this picture to long. Its a well done Tarzan movie. That slow movement?",1
Lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb. Ultimately it's a tragedy.,1
"He's just a personal favorite. < br / > < br / > I can't say that same, however, for his films. Woah, now, don't start getting crazy on me just yet. Before I review this film, I must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer.",1
The greatest Tarzan ever made!,1
"But, certainly I liked it.",1
You'll love it or hate it according to your own tastes.,1
"is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most cynical critic. It is a tale of family, of the seeking of a father by a real and emotional orphan.",1
There is absolutely no doubt that this version of Tarzan is the closest to Burroughs'vision.,1
"In the first half, we see Tarzan in his jungle environment. He is portrayed as a'noble savage ', whether in the wild or in elegant Edwardian parlors. Twenty years later, this young man ( i. e. Tarzan ) rescues a wounded Belgian explorer, nursing him back to health. < br / > < br / > The movie is sort of divided into two parts.",1
"This is the essential Burrough's Tarzan that I grew up reading when I was a kid. Lambert was excellent. < br / > < br / > The photography and the apes, done by Rick Baker both were amazing.",1
This movie is just the perfection..,1
"Later returned to what is to him an alien world, that of class and privilege, he feels totally out of place. A sad but triumphant story told against a background of fantastic vistas.",1
"The Apes then take him to where they live and adopt him as one of their own, as the years go by John grows up and learns to be more like the Apes. The film has some funny moments, sad moments and touching moments that makes this a real classic. John is then torn between his life as a Greystoke and Lord of the Apes.",1
"From his charismatic work in this film and his very haunting eyes, I cannot understand why Lambert did not later become a big star, but his really bad movie choices later may have done him in. The terrific Ian Holm, as a wounded Frenchman in Africa helped by Tarzan and who then escorted Tarzan back to his previously unknown, ancestral home in Scotland, was great as always. Andy MacDowell was pretty and pretty good as Tarzan's gussied - up and civilized "" Jane "" in her first movie role.",1
"This begins a series ( which I'll hopefully keep up every week - end ) of films that came out during my childhood in this case, it's one I've only managed to catch now. ), the film - makers rather lost track of the fact that the thing was intended primarily as entertainment!",1
"The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or obtrusive. The costumes are outstanding. < br / > < br / > The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, as other commentators have noted. In a stunning performance, Christopher Lambert portrays this angst with absolute realism. I don't know why her voice was overdubbed, either. But Lambert never lets that happen. The scenery is lush and exotic, and the colors are vivid. It is beautifully filmed and faithful to the Edgar Rice Burroughs stories. It will plummet into the cheesy depths.",1
< br / > < br / > An excellent and underrated movie. Greystoke is without doubt the best tarzan movie I have ever seen.,1
It's also an excellent rereading from a popular novel. So why is it only rated barely ( 6 / 10 )? Happy because Tarzan comes back to the jungle and meets again his adoptive close relatives. But he ignores his real origins. great role. The movie was partly made in Africa ( more precisely in Cameroon ). Its productors made Tarzan one of the most successful cinema characters. The second one in England where Tarzan discovers the English society.,1
"After I first saw this, I thought, "" Wow, this is the most spectacular movie, visually - speaking, I've ever seen. "" Sharp DVD or not, this is still a stunning film to view and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes. This is supposedly more true to the Tarzan books, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Since that time, I've seen some that topped it but it still ranks as one of the best in that department. < br / > < br / > The special effects in here were done by Rick Baker, one of the best in the business.",1
"Bruno winds up in the swanky chalet of kindly rich doctor Don Simon ( a fine performance by Lautaro Murua ). But Meiko manages to seriously wound Bruno before he gets away. Alejandro Ulloa's slick cinematography, and a decent sprinkling of nudity and soft - core sex. A pleasingly grim and worthwhile shocker.",1
"In fact, too bad he never tried Sartre's Nausea. I guess we have to. And nobody ever handled small disgust better than Clouzot. And in how many films has anyone ever done that. But forget about the mystery here : this is the ultimate McGuffin. Should we take the opening shot as a strange frame??? < br / > < br / > As for the other aspects of the movie, others here have covered them in a lot more detail than I.",1
"< br / > < br / > Martineau is the centerpiece of this film. Hey, he is good!! Who is that boy that is perhaps not his son? Well, simply a very entertaining, fun film. But alas, Martineau, too, can keep a dark secret in his past.",1
"< br / > < br / > To me, this is the greatest of Clouzot's movies. "" < br / > < br / > Maurice the husband is jealous and timid, but runs away from the scene of the crime. De Gaulle came back in 1958, as President. < br / > < br / > Quai des Orfèvres is more human. < br / > < br / > They both had health problems.",1
"( Willis Rules!!!!!!! All the characters are great, and I thought Willis and Spencer Breslin were just awesome together, plus Bruce Willis is simply amazing in this!. Emily Mortimer is good as Amy and was really cute I liked her she had decent chemistry with Bruce too. It's good natured and it was cool how you can see Russell's ( Willis ) character change throughout the film! plus the ending was pretty good. The Acting is excellent!. Overall a must see!. * * * * out pf 5 ). Lily Tomlin is funny as Janet I liked her quite a bit. Jean Smart is good with what she had to do, which was not much.",1
The naive ending is also typical in Steven Spielberg'good - ending films. We can find great actors too ( Suzy Delair is impeccable ). Quai des Orfèvres inheritance is palpable in Woody Allen tradition. Henri - Georges Clouzot's film is quiet an example of the french transition cinema. Plunging a crime situation in a picturesque environment.,1
"He really'fill'his part, and this is wonderful. One of the best film I ever saw.",1
He tended to adapt Steeman's books in a satiric note. It is Clouzot's most playful hour. It offers an outstanding performance by Jouvet as a tough police inspector. QUAY is not subversive in the sense that today's ( and already yesterday's ) philistines enjoy using the word.,1
"Blier is fine, if a bit one sided. Louis Jouvet is perfect, you just can't have a better copper. This film is so lovingly made you want to be part of it forever.",1
Maurice is furious and forbids it. Is it a murder mystery? Jenny is more than willing. Martineau is something of a sad sack.,1
"Jouvet practically stole the movie with wonderfully cynic and sentimental in the same time performance. "" His character, his eagle - like profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable. "" Enters tenacious policeman ( Louis Jouvet ) who is determined to discover the truth. """,1
"Interestingly, this is a suspense film in which suspense is generated in spite of the knowledge one would traditionally think too much too soon. Maybe it is due to the vibrance of the dance halls and theater settings of 1940s France, which all work as the milieu of this crime thriller. We just don't know who did. < br / > < br / > Quay of Goldsmiths is the least dark of Henri - Georges Clouzot's films. Her husband and accompanist, played by Bernard Blier, is a composed but jealous man.",1
A gritty look at Paris of the time. You can ignore the final scene ( the Hollywood ending ).,1
The Director loves the actress and it shows. The character loves her jealous unprepossessing husband and he loves her.,1
"Good for the whole family. In my opinion, it's a must - see movie. It was brilliant, to say the least.",1
"Steeman complained about Clouzot's adaptation for both movies. So we get to know all the characters in depth. Bernard Blier gives, as ever, a sparing of gestures and words performance, and he really pulls it off. Of course, the word is never uttered ( How could it be in 1947? ) The police chief ( fabulous Louis Jouvet ) tells her : "" You and me, WE are not lucky with women. """,1
This is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it. Period.,1
"< br / > < br / > Bernard Blier is perfect as the jealous husband. Frankly, and no disrespect to Mr. Falk intended, it's like comparing a great champagne to a good house wine. < br / > < br / > Louis Jouvet, who is seen as a police detective, is perfect in part. This was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a pillar of the French theater.",1
"Quai des Orfevres takes too long getting going, with Clouzot so enamored of his back - stage milieu that he is almost in danger of forgetting the story.",1
"TV MA. And I love it!!! This is a very funny show in it's own ways. It's a parody of children's shows, namely Sesame Street. Then there's the newscaster and the pink puppet.",1
What more could you want in a kid's show! You may only post a single comment per title.,1
I love this show. He'good.,1
"It makes me very uncomfortable, but in a very comforting way.",1
"However, I don't think it's clever getting little children to say rude things. I'm torn about this show. It's really funny and it's mostly improvised.",1
NICE! You're in for a treat. I LOVE THIS SHOW!,1
Imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid.,1
"by using names associated with various It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm. Some people are bisexual, it is true, but most tend to be either hetero - or homosexual. The film ignores this. This was a great film in every sense of the word.",1
Truly a wonderful movie.,1
"You know that he is going to have to change before the final credits. He degrades, not only his clients, but those close to him as well. This forces Willis to come to grips with his past and well.. you know the rest. < br / > < br / > Appearing as Willis'love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as his Executive Assistant.",1
What do they expect at 40?,1
"She works with him, puts up with his'ego'and yet, she is smitten with Russell. It's different and yet it is somehow familiar. A small boy, who looks exactly like.... - - him. Very much so. < br / > < br / > All in all this is a That's Russell Duritz. < br / > < br / > Amy the supporting young lady of the story is probably the best balance that he has seen and has in his life.",1
"This movie is definitely worth seeing. But truthfully, nobody cared. Usually we scorn at "" What if... "" movies.",1
"Willis manages to balance Russell's cutthroat powerbroker traits with vulnerability and confusion, without becoming ridiculous. He just needs someone to show him the way. In order for a good script to succeed, however, you need actors to bring it to life. ).",1
Both movies are engaging on more than one level. ( I refer of course to The Sixth Sense. ),1
"If you haven't seen it yet, you damn well should. This is a totally awesome movie! Thus, I give it ten stars.",1
"She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter ( not her father! ) This is my first Deepa Mehta film. Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by Ms Mehta, not her direction. They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men.",1
What a film.,1
"NOTHING in Hollywood was as close as these were to out and out strange. That's because it was easy to find. A lot of the times the original Spanish is not much saner. Besides, HOW do you resist the title?",1
Even the dialogue was good along with the acting.,1
"And the fact that it was more of an art house movie. I liked it better than Memento although this was, perhaps, due to the lower expectations. Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, over three years ago.",1
"< br / > < br / > I'm telling you that if you loved Memento, you will love Following as well. I am just confused about why its not in the Top 50 along with Memento. Brilliant!",1
The plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology. The event sequence complicates following Following. By the end of the film the disjointed story is explained thoroughly.,1
"Elements of the storyline i think are a bit daft but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing. I would recommend people go to see Momento and then if they like that, see this film.",1
"There are two things that I noticed in this film. Everyone's got a box "". < br / > < br / > Color me obsessive. You don't see these often "".",1
"One man he follows, he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he bargained for.",1
"It's a better film, but this one isn't bad just different. All of the married characters lack the "" fire "" of the marriage bed with their respective spouses. CONTAINS "" SPOILER "" INFORMATION. Her sari catches on fire and at first we think she is going to die. They only have sex once when his closet lesbian wife loses her virginity. < br / > < br / > A rare feminist point of view from an Indian filmmaker. We come to really care about the characters and we don't see them as stereotypes.",1
It is very good.,1
"But it's still a fine debut, simultaneously claustrophobic and beguiling.",1
An impressive debut by one of today best directors. Good Stuff! Both are great performances.,1
"In Memento, Nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly. However, Nolan experimented with it a little, and it just doesn't work. I felt like someone had smacked me on the head and given me a concussion. Then, a saucy young blond ( Lucy Russell ) enters, and the movie becomes even weirder from there. He finds one, Cobb ( Alex Haw ), that particularly interests him. Sure, Fight Club had an amazing ending, but the way that Following's ending played out was amazing.",1
9 / 10 A suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production.,1
"The story is very brilliant, and very well developed.",1
"Following is a little - known 1998 British film, which was made with a budget of £8000 and has a running time of 70 minutes. Hence, it can be said that Following is a contemporary film noir, or a neo - noir.",1
"As told, we follow a writer wannabe called Bill ( Jeremy Theobald ) who starts a habitual obsession with following random people he fancies on the streets in a voyeuristic manner, which at first could be conceived as research, before he starts to make up his own rules, and break them. There are enough twists here which spins the film into a dizzying crescendo, where loose ends begin to come together, and the brilliance of stellar story start to shine through.",1
The well dressed man says his name is Cobb. Only the man can't think of anything to write. He follows him for a few days.,1
The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece. 75.,1
And that is where I think the film succeeds so well. It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists. Memento shows how even the simplest of stories can be turned into a mind - bender. At every point the film kept me guessing as to where it was leading me. The film has many elements that led me off on many wild goose chases.,1
"Even Pi doesn't even come close IMO, though it's also very good. They were all believable and that's all they need to be. If you liked Memento,'Following'is definitely for you. < br / > < br / > Following is an exquisite example of how films should be made. Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is a memorable one.",1
This idea has been done with moderate success before but Nolan has truly made it his own. < br / > < br / > The script here is Nolan's finest. The dialogue and atmosphere is bold and intelligent. It's a beautifully imagined film.,1
"That, and as well in the film - noir mood Nolan also puts together a cunning web of a plot, maybe even more so than Memento.",1
"Bill also has an odd and strange habit, he likes to follow people. Whats makes "" Following "" so much better is just by it being simple but at same time brainy in it's affect on those who watch it.",1
Quite amazing.,1
"Great film. B & w gave it a basic, no - frills feel also. No gratuitous gimmicks like in most Hollywood films. Everything supported the suspense of the plot. Characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively.",1
I rated it 8 out of 10. < br / > < br / > Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget. The story and dialogue is really good. The performance of the actors is believable.,1
"Both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them. < br / > < br / > If you like suspense films with surprise endings, this one is must see.",1
It's worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film.,1
I can't wait for Batman. The writing is fantastic. This is a low budget gem.,1
Gilligan says to Jim Leonard.,1
"Still, he's very good and very appealing as the idealistic young inventor of a new airplane motor. Yet they are both very good here. Humphrey Bogart in his first starring role looks very young, acts well, but has a pronounced lisp only hinted at later in his career. Mackaill wasn't even 30 when appeared in this film! < br / > < br / > Both Mackaill ( whi had been a star in silent films ) and Bogart were trying to gain a toehold in talkies in 1932.",1
"I was greeted by a comment from another user, who believed that it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10, and underwhelming. Carrie's War, "" however, is probably the best I've seen so far. Truly. I absolutely recommend this to everyone. < br / > < br / > The end is gratifying in every sense but one ; that everyone did not get what they deserved but overall things worked out.",1
Who could this NRI be?! Will Prem stop her? Rani Mukherjee is great too. Prem moves on and in comes Priya ( Rani Mukherjee ). There's even a scene where he takes off his shirt! What a surprise!!!,1
It got annoying from time to time.,1
I really liked this movie.,1
"A scenario found in countless other Korean films. Who does one choose? Anyway, "" Romance of Their Own "" soon takes a turn much for the better. < br / > < br / > But don't give up so quickly! "" His reaction rang true to me and I appreciated the scene. It's like someone just pulled the plug on him.",1
"But as the story develops the two wives, trapped in loveless marriages, draw together. Near perfect!",1
I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater. This story is basically about the training of a Coast Guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines. I am happy to say that Ashton is great in this part.,1
"Let's face it. < br / > < br / > Still, I like this movie. < br / > < br / > I'd definitely recommend this movie to everyone.",1
"'Cause that sure was the case with Old Boy, and Temptation of Wolves. If the guys can't fight like that in real life, they sure fooled me. Meanwhile, Hea - won falls for her, and takes her as his boyfriend. I watched it, and, damn, the fighting scenes are REALLY good.",1
"The look of ever episode appears as smooth as if it had been a single motion picture project. < br / > < br / > And there was the excellent WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALIANT YEARS. GLORIFYING not GLAMORIZING World War II.",1
"IMDb'facts were rather skimpy, I have to find out more about him. The score is impressive, if a bit too much by today's standards. 50, so I thought I would take another look. Great job! He did a few more outstanding documentaries before his early death. < br / > < br / > Should be seen by every ruler, or potential ruler. Many independent stations repeated them for many years. Total of 13 hours to watch it all ( 26 episodes ).",1
It was good to see Eric Roberts and Mark Dacoscos play parts in a family film.,1
My 4 and 5 year - olds ( and I ) loved it. Rent and be blessed!,1
"This was a great movie. The dream scenes were a distraction at first, but did a great deal to establish plot.",1
"Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley give solid performances as well. Go figure! < br / > < br / > The young actors give uniformly believable performances, seemingly quite invested in their roles - - silly as many scenes are. This film is titled "" Junior Pilot "" here on IMDb but "" Final Approach "" at Netflix.",1
I don't want to give away any more of the plot.,1
I loved it. This means that the drama and tension is maintained until the end. There is a different novel staged in each chapter.,1
).,1
"I woke up at night dreaming of the Golden Pagoda. They could be used as exemplars for any set designer. This movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet, Mishima.",1
"At times, it is difficult to follow, and there may be little to recommend for the uninitiated viewer. Each of the three themes of beauty, art, and action is exemplified in the chosen depictions from the respective novels. Schrader edits scenes recreating that day with three different scenarios from Mishima's novels : Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kyoko's House, and Runaway Horses. Paul Schrader and his brother Leonard wrote Mishima, and in so doing, clearly drew parallels between the life of Yukio Mishima and his work. * * * of 4 stars. The black and white scenes represent memories from Mishima's childhood and youth.",1
Still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn't found won. This film truley deserves more. 10 / 10 All without being confusing in the least bit.,1
"It doesn't quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it. Mishima "" is the best film I've seen this year, so far. "" John Bailey's cinematography is spectacularly good.",1
!,1
"The only pure life, is one that ends with a signature in blood. < br / > < br / > So says Mishima anyway, a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author.",1
"I think the film shows that he was. I think so. Imagine if Schrader had directed Taxi Driver or Bringing Out The Dead, instead of Scorsese. Is this the definition of a work of art? Every brushstroke in Mishima is perfect and it all flows from the Schrader's script. This is my favourite film and I think it is perfect. Finally, the music is simply superb His life is represented in black and white, still camera, formal compositions. So you wouldn't necessarily imagine that Schrader was the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty on film.",1
"Worth a look for those interested in vastly different cultures. ( Dar! ) Although India is rapidly modernizing, her culture is not keeping up. Her quiet beauty and low - key psychic suffering was excellent.",1
This film exceeds in every aspect and is a joy to watch. Not to mention the incredible Philip Glass Soundtrack.,1
Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget by Sunday morning. Ken Ogata is magnificent as Mishima. Motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever. Not since 2001 has a film score been such a perfect compliment to it's visuals. Mishima falls into the latter category.,1
The Philip Glass score is mesmerizing. It has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film.,1
Truly an underrated gem of a film.,1
Hopefully this film will soon be available on DVD.,1
I got to talk to Rod Rowland and James Brolin. < br / > < br / > Rowland's character was good to go. That's the season I give the high rating to!,1
PWOG fits the bill. Was it Emmy material?,1
I rate this movie 9 / 10. < br / > < br / > The acting is very good.,1
"Ocean's twelve is probably better than Ocean's eleven. After three years, it was good seeing the gang return. After she meets him again, she begins to follow them around. This film they have a bit more motivation the second time around.",1
"She simply doesn't fit and her chemistry with Pitt is non - existent. Plenty. Ocean's 12 < br / > < br / >'If you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you. Slow? '( Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard ) < br / > < br / > This adage certainly rings true in this sequel.",1
"We'll never know, because they didn't try. At least, not in the way I expected. Would it sustain the feeling of the first film?",1
"Film certainly can be a narrative medium, but by no means is it the ideal medium.",1
"If you want a clever heist movie, better stick with 11. Clearly, he knew this from the get - go. But if star - gazing turns you on, this will make your day.",1
The cohesiveness of the group in Ocean'Eleven was gone. I felt cheated out of knowing the whole story.,1
Eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum.,1
Marcos likes to kill people. But there are evil bad guys afoot. There are also cameos by Ed Lauter and Burt Reynolds.,1
And then just throw in Jack great and you got yourself an Oscar. Easy as pie.,1
This is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. Just brace yourself for low budget and no blood. I loved this movie! Hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie!?!?,1
"When the guy left the pub, the priest then hung up the phone and was was laughing at Jeffrey. It was from thereafter that he got use to the homicidal behaviour and made killing his hobby - for both evil and emotional reasons. This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life. His evil and cold blooded facial expressions before he massacred his victims were so real, I was shivering in my seat.",1
"It isn't a glamorized, unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film "" Dahmer "" ( 2001 ) was. Well, if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one. And while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low, you will see the results. Let's filter the more judgmental.. Ok, are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of Jeffrey Dahmer? Can you withstand an independent, low - budget film?",1
"SPOILER ALERT! < br / > < br / > Their relationship is one thing, but the girl's mother is entirely different. Their relationship reminds me a lot of that between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in "" Badlands "", where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger. In my humble opinion. < br / > < br / > I think this film had a lot beneath its shell.",1
This was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid.,1
"I remembered it was on channel 11 at 2PM everyday. Now, I hope the kids today enjoy the show. Life seemed so much simpler and better. I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in the tree.",1
I grew up in New York and this show came on when I was four - years - old. This was so much better than a lot of the kid shows today.,1
"One of the best memories of my childhood. Should be on DVD. They were the best, and Carol was also the original Sandy in the original production of "" Grease "" ( cool ). "", also, "" Sunshine "", and "" The Point. """,1
Very 70s feeling. Pity that. OhMyGAWD!!!,1
You might want to wait for the DVD on this one.,1
This movie was one of the best I've seen this year. It's a good one!,1
"I caught this film at an OutFest screening in Los Angeles in July, 2006.",1
"This is a movie, that has all the basic elements of its genre.",1
It's a film that has almost too much on its mind. Unfortunately all is not well. The priest finds that he needs blood to survive.,1
"I look forward to seeing more of Ash Christian, Ashley Fin and Jonathan Caouette soon. I had read up on the film and thought it would be cute, a feel good Saturday night movie. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.",1
"& the scenery is gorgeous. they made a nice team. He is still living & I wish him well. < br / > < br / > It is a fast enjoyable 89 minutes. ( today they call them hookers ), Angie Dickinson assays this role nicely. John Carradine'son David, who is still making movies. He made only a few more movies.",1
The second was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. In eluding their pursuers Carradine and Walker become separated. < br / > < br / > Not that Young Billy Young does not have its moments of hilarity. He looks hauntingly like his father. David Carradine is John's son.,1
"True! But foreigners may miss the point, as it's not clearly expressed.",1
The ending is so much the better for being untidy. ).,1
"but it ended well, leaving us with the nice feeling that Kentaro is permanently 25, studying on. This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. good series, check it out.",1
Finally! It is just hilarious. It hurt.,1
"The psychological aspect that I love about Park's previous films is in Thirst, as well. Nevertheless, it is my one nitpick of the film. He doesn't, however, have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror. Thirst is no exception. The soundtracks to Park's films always seem to fit its respective film like a glove.",1
"Boy who one day may save world.... or maybe not. Golden Boy is in my opinion one the sleeper / lost treasures animes out there. However, being unique as it is.",1
"< br / > < br / > Episode # 2 has the rich, young daughter who likes to tease. It certainly isn't that I like naked cartoon girls. < br / > < br / > The formula is the same for each episode. She also dresses completely unprofessionally. He IS the Goldenboy. < br / > < br / > Episode # 1 features a rich software tycoon.",1
"< br / > < br / > Definitely the funniest! That was so friggin hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing. ( I laughed so hard! ) One of the best I've seen.",1
It's hilarious. Believe me when I say this show is just plain hilarious.,1
5 / 10 Rush and buy this tape right away.,1
"The score is suitably overwrought. Man, I can't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie. Okay, it sure ain't no sophisticated work of cinematic art. Pretty brunette Rachel Carter pops her top and bares cute little breasts.",1
"This movie has a veritable cast of thousands. The end result : unintentional comic gold. What is a double - dream? Clever device, no? Oh yeah! The kid, seriously, has no ability to emote whatsoever. They're either killed by Jack - O, or they serve no purpose whatsoever. While they're certainly bad movies, they don't belong in the bottom 100. < br / > < br / > Jack - O himself was pretty sweet.",1
< br / > < br / > I recommend it. I don't need a director to use new tricks. Of course. < br / > < br / > I've heard and read several things about'tricks used in other films '.,1
I believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of £8000 but that didn't really show.,1
It is very strange watching a film spoken in my local North East Scotland accent but that soon passed.,1
Watch 3colours blue instead. The best thing about the film? If so? The cast. As for the effects?,1
Acting was better than average for a low budget film. After reading it was filmed on Balmedie beach i just had to buy it.,1
Is it a cult movie? I loved this movie!,1
"75 seconds ), and some relation to the story. that is it for props. why? did he feel himself losing control? The captain was great, but a few of his scenes could have used another take. < br / > < br / > The cgi is fine.",1
This will doubtless annoy others as it annoyed me. Well it ; a game of 2 halfs. The opening half of the film is well written and sharp. The script?,1
"Anyway, the e - pods all land on a barren planet with The characters were clearly identified and all had something to do. I don't know how much it cost. Even having said that, much of the script was great. I like the e - pods - they're an excellent idea done very well and make more sense than a nice, roomy escape capsule. On many levels it's very good.",1

"Overall, this isn't exactly a classic and there are certainly a lot worse trashy adventure movies out there than this one. The biggest location standout in the film is definitely the lost city of Atlantis. The way that the plot comes together isn't exactly genius, but it takes in a lot of ideas and I've seen films made on plots with much less thought put into them than this one. The central plot follows a boat which crashes on a small island.",1

"* * * Spoiler in fifth paragraph * * * This was an amazingly frank ( uh - huh, uh - huh ) picture for 1955. Frank Sinatra took a chance both on playing an addicted musician and at falling flat on his face in a role that required at least twice as much acting as he'd ever done. Ultimately it's not just Frankie who has the addiction, everyone and everything seems to be dependent on him and he feels it keenly. All in all these gambles paid off, the movie is a classic, though it's not perfect.",1
The involvement of human beings in the process is almost incidental. Today Otto Preminger would be lucky to get a job delivering pizzas in Hollywood.,1
Frank is free to love Molly and he won't go to jail. The actors are uniformly fine. His embarrassment when he can't play the correct beat is devastating. Elmer Bernstein's score is one of the best of its time. The ending is a little too pat.,1

"< br / > < br / > Darren McGavin got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler. He uses a few underhanded methods to get Sinatra's services back. His performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl. Who knows, maybe Preminger couldn't get enough money to pay for the location. But a whole lot of people are conspiring against him. 1955 marked the high point of her career. But I think of the three this one is the best. It's the only flaw I find in the film.

You must know the story through various other reviews, so lets speak about what is brilliant about this movie. I wish the relationship between the protagonists had developed in a better way. That what they feel is love doesn't come across till the end. The movie explores that idea and it is a beautiful one. The first being a woman who has opted out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way. You hate the former and your heart bleeds for the latter. So, would you still love your partner if he / she were to change his / her sex?",1

Actually, the script is overally, to my opinion, quite ingenious. Haven't seen The Beyond ). This is maybe the most concentrated and straightly personal movie Fulci did.",1
"Make no mistake : "" Cat in the Brain "" is a total gorefest, and as disjointed as Fulci's previous films, but it deserves credit for trying to be something more. For much of the'70s into the mid -'80s, he cranked out such stylistically distinctive horrors as "" City of the Living Dead, "" "" The Beyond, "" and the brutal giallo "" The New York Ripper, "" fondly remembered by fans like myself.",1
"Fulci... Even the Braindead didn't stop it. He is such a brilliant director. < br / > < br / > Fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert is Fulci's last masterpiece. CITB is all about gore.",1
"Italian genre films also declined in quality and profitability. Until I saw it here, I could only imagine what it looked like. His rabid fan - base will probably love it. Coincidently (? )",1
"With such a plot, the movie should have been filled with something. This is probably his goriest film, and unfortunately one the last. In this time, the doctor begins a long chain of serial crimes.",1
"Fulci's boat says Perversion (.. excellent touch ) and he sails off.. Director Fulci playing himself, is directing GHOSTS OF SODOM (? ) I know ) during running time. The ending (.. explaining the old cliché : "" It's only a movie "" ) couldn't work any better than it does here. and can not seem to deprive his mental well being from constant murder. This has a shower murder Hitchcock never could direct, or probably want to. I can only wish this was his final film because that's a perfect close if there ever was one. Even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or running a faucet of water yield some horrific butchery from a film in the past.",1
"Some of you may take that as a minus, but in reality it's a big plus. The great thing about Thirst, Chanwook Park's latest film, is that it's the anti - Twilight. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously, and as well the torrid love story between Sang - hyeon and Tae - Joo.",1

"There is a lot of blood and gore, including chainsaw butchery, bloody stabbings and numerous decapitations. Highly recommended, especially if you like extreme cinema! "" Un Gatto nel Cervello "" / "" Cat in the Brain "" is one of the goriest horror movies ever made.",1

Of course, from a more professional viewpoint, this production can't exactly be called a masterpiece! He quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom. The gore is overpowering and copious, to say the least.",1

< br / > < br / > Bit closet land is so much more than a message. For some people a nice touch. The film lacks in action. Closet land is not at happy movie.,1
"Closet Land is an amazing, terrifying piece of cinema. She refuses. She finds herself in a room with Alan Rickman, a seemingly pleasant functionary. In the end, she is free, She is told that it will all end if she just signs a confession. She is increasingly subjected to physical and mental torture. It should be seen, though. A simple little act.",1
I've never been so affected by a movie!,1
The sound editing heightens to appropriate effect.,1
It has so many layers.,1
"In the end, I found the whole thing fascinating. The plot is distinctly original and the actors are two of my absolute favourites. Not flawless and definitely not for everyone, but rewarding. Just don't expect any overexplicit sermons or eyefilling action sequences. It's nowhere near a masterpiece like Kieslowski's'A short film about killing'or as explanatory as'Dead man walking '.",1
"So the horror is always unexpected, and brutal. This is the film I will always remember both actors for.",1
It really is that good. I have yet to see it other than on Laserdisc.,1
< br / > < br / > This is just a great film.,1
What would it be like to be accused of being a subversive?,1
The acting is _ fantastic _.,1
I really love this movie.,1
< br / > < br / > This is an important movie. It could be profoundly transformative.,1
It's happening now.,1
We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place. All you need to know is that the movie is all about an interrogation. Especially when you have absolutely no control over it.,1
This movie describes to those who don't care the reality of a large part of current world governments.,1
"< br / > < br / > But it didn't turn out horribly. Acting, of course! On the contrary, thanks to incredible portrayals by both Stowe and Rickman, Closet Land is a masterpiece in its own right.",1
"The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of'in the round "" theater.",1
"I came away from Bakjwi being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true Park fashion. Now that I have seen it, it was NOT what I was expecting, at least not until the very END. I was also happy that Park did not CG the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little CG at all. Don't expect Oldboy and stylization because that's not what you'll get here. That was a nice effect.",1
"< br / > < br / > This is not a movie to be entered into lightly, and you most certainly do ENTER it.",1
And that is really what's at the heart of this Amnesty International film. Closet Land.,1
Anyway this made for TV movie is good for a few laughs. Later the residence seems to be more like the people in Deliverance.,1
Several camera shots and sequences will give you a sense of deja vu.,1
< br / > < br / > All in all a great film to watch over and over again.,1
Typical Loach.,1
"Recently released on British DVD, this is a good movie ( as long as you have an attention span and IQ of more than a fruit fly ). Not as depressing as it could have been, this is kitchen - sink at its most dirty.",1
One of the best of the'kitchen - sinks '. Pefectly set to Donovan's dulcet tones.,1
"Her name is Joy, but she experiences no joy in her life. Even if that wasn't intended, it's still a movie that I recommend to everyone.",1
"until I caught up in the 80 '. I just heard of his successes, "" Kes "", "" Family Life "", "" Black Jack "". Although 20th Century Fox distributed "" Poor Cow "" in Panama, Loach did not stay in mainstream cinema ( which this film hardly is ) and I lost contact with his films.",1
"And when that boil, quite a few bad things start to happen. Plus this is the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yet.",1
"It got used before in the 1975 movie "" Columbo : Playback "". If it ain't broke don't fix it. But oh well, that is what made the Columbo series so great and consistent. It doesn't make the movie They had some nice sequences together. It's definitely a better movie than the average'later'Columbo movie entry.",1
You know rest.,1
His strength lies in his adaptation of personal experiences both on screen and in the classroom. The mystical aspect of the film is intriguing and adds to suspense. You find your self looking for the answers along with Marquette. < br / > < br / > I'd love to own a copy - how do I go about getting one? This movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths.,1
Try to get a copy of it and see for yourself! It's very well directed and the production value is top notch.,1
< br / > < br / > I saw this film in Vail or Aspen at a film festival and was wowed by it. What a great short film!,1
"I gave this 9 stars out of a possible 10. < br / > < br / > Nonetheless it is a highly interesting film. Flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns some new lessons about life. < br / > < br / > They're going south, to Florida, and take her under their wing, but is everyone quite the way they're presenting themselves?",1
"I totally suggest seeing this movie. """,1
< br / > < br / > I didn't see it on the big screen but I can only urge everyone to go out and see it. Fantastic film! More films like this are * exactly * what we need. < br / > < br / > SF I'm sure we'll be seeing Emily in more films in the future.,1
"I don't have to be rog ebert to know it's one of the best movies I've seen all year, and certainly one of the most truthful.",1
"Don't let me convince you that the film has no inclinations. I've reviewed many and have a few more to discuss. There are two ways to dissect it. The vampire "" craze "" has, in my opinion, actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization. The same cannot be said of Daybreakers or New Moon.",1
With perfect akwardness. I think it would do phenominally! The acting was top notch! This movie ahould be brought to the mainstream!,1
"She then meets a personable older couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. Her sleazy boss propositions her - she quits and takes a little bit of cash from the register. You will enjoy this film. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida, is not a short trip, and her Ford Escort dies out. Especially I - 95. Beware!!. at the story.",1
Story is dark and disturbing. Small cast. Great independent film.,1
Way to go. I liked it. Good job on a low budget.,1
A great performance by Emily Grace!,1
"Surprisingly, the storyline comes forward and is played through the screen in a way that I feel most would relate to. Wish I had put popcorn maker on after all well done!",1
"I was virtually on the edge of my seat the entire time. ( And by the way, I wish there was a soundtrack album. ) It's 6.",1
"Bill and Sandra keep her money in the safe where customers aren't going to find it. Sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore, although we don't find this out at once. Alice misunderstands. They guide her. But, no. Bill has a comical face and is retired from the Army.",1
"The home movie quality really makes you feel like you are there with the characters, a part of their RV trip across the country. It is rather vulgar and disturbing at times, even if it is not completely sad in the end. The characters seemed so realistic to me, it was hard to believe they weren't real people. This is a very amazing movie!",1
Emily Grace's Alice is infused with a doey - eyed magic.,1
"But when it works, man, does fly. The film is also perversely hilarious. She gives one of the best performances of the year. OK - vin Kim should become a worldwide star after this film. From the director of Oldboy comes this slick vampire flick. Shin has cancer, and his mother believes that Song can cure it.",1
"It is a sad story, though. Either way, it'a very good film, and for some reason I suspect sour grapes from those who have scored this one low.",1
"She sets out for Florida and to stay with her wealthier high school friend who is a freshman at Miami. This is a low budget, well acted little gem. Through intermittent flashbacks, we learn a little more about Alice and her desire to leave tiny Milford.",1
"There is not a false note in her character choices. < br / > < br / > As a newcomer performing in her first screen role, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational. One of strengths of the film is that it never quite fully answers that question. But is she really a better person?",1
"Prostitution is everywhere. This is how things really are. < br / > < br / > The Alice of the film comes from a background quite different from that of Lewis Carroll's Alice. The man is shy and deferential and apologizes for "" finishing "" too fast. Her fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. The book's complete title is "" Through the Looking - Glass ( And What Alice Found There ) "". Alice leaves the motor home with her well - earned money and a feeling of mutual respect. Initially, Alice passively accepts her ministrations and, with the couple'instructions, does several tricks.",1
"As written and directed by A. Sandra and Bill convince her to come along in their plush R. V. on her way down South. What Alice Found "" was a pleasant discovery.",1
"Altogether this is a pretty entertaining diversion for mean spirited trash fans, especially those with a taste for Japanese rapey adventures. I More important are the effects, by Nobuaki Koga, which pack an impressively splattery punch when they appear, helped out by the lunatic nature of the climactic shenanigans. Things even pull to a curiously affecting ending, sure it ain't a weepy or anything, but for a film so gutter level for most of its runtime it is relatively poignant.",1
"The gangsters then plonk her body in the boot of their car, along with the remains of Higashi, ready for disposal. ).",1
"< br / > < br / > Well it is better than "" Entrails of a Virgin "", but not by much. This he, she = it makes mince meat out of the yakuza and saves the daynot really. It apparently ends badly when she overdoses from the cocaine.",1
They then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more. This is when BEAUTY really takes off with some pretty f! ( no sh!,1
"That has been true and remains true with the release of "" Thirst "". ! And hopefully you are already familiar with Park Chan - Wook's work. Watch it as soon as you can!",1
"I can see how many people would think that it's just a shocker film. This movie, I would like to say, was completely great. Its like atrophy.",1
8 / 10. Wouldn't you rather see a hermaphroditic monster with a hilarious little snake monster for a winky?,1
"I recently saw Episodes 1 - 4, and now I can't wait for 5 & 6 to be available! Bowlsby is a master of the put - down... ( I've heard they are coming soon. )",1
I have to say that I was very pleased when I finally had the chance to see the show. I first heard about Commander's Log when I was on the concom for the local science fiction convention.,1
"With the "" Jofa "" brand - name still visible? Think Yes Minister meets Red Dwarf, but on a shoe - string budget. Okay, there's a lot of that in Commander's Log, but it's cute. It does a good job of being that.",1
"It's fun to watch. If you like Red Dwarf, you'll probably like this.",1
"Perhaps, and Visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look away from. While watching, we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Thomas Mann has no mercy for this game. Is any of this filmable? Aschenbach No. 1.",1
"Here, it would be appropriate to say : "" GOOD MOVIE IS PARALLEL TO NO ACTION. "" If you'll like it or not... that'a different story, very personal one. Why? In other words, all has a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogs. All is doomed to fade, to wither like flowers on meadow when their time comes. It must be seen more than twice with the mind that is constantly open.",1
"Dirk Bogarde gives his finest screen performance - he himself believed so. This is a ravishing, yet spare adaption of Thomas Mann's novelette of the same title.",1
< br / > < br / > Park Chan Wook's direction was fantastic. The use of color stands out most. Sometimes the story flow was clunky. The cinematography was well above excellent.,1
Note : I recommmend multiple viewings.,1
I also recommend the novel.,1
And this is simply the best movie ever.,1
"< br / > < br / > Ultimately, Gustav is forced to make his biggest decision : stay in Venice and resign himself to his lust and temptations? In his flashback, after paying the prostitute, Gustav is clearly physically seized by the consequences of his actions. This reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that Tadzio represents. Or flee Venice to save his own life?",1
"< br / > < br / > Life was slow then, compared to now. Not if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum. It is a monument in movie history.",1
From this fact does so much great tragedy emerge.,1
He has knit his ideas - foibles and all - into a meticulously paced arc. 7 / 10 A film to divide its viewers.,1
"Death in Venice "" isn't one of them. His music, especially what we hear of it here, is very slow. I much prefer the former. Wagner and Mahler wrote music that is PROPERLY played at a snail's pace. It's a great work.",1
"In short, it was a disappointing movie. Or the creation of Alfred who I don't remember in the book. I'm not sure where to start with this. In the book, it is Aschenbach who steals glances at the boy.",1
Easily one of the best films of 2009. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy.,1
< br / > < br / > The movie is truly more character / story driven than action. As others that have commented around the web... But what movie hasn't been remade a million times. I'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard. < br / > < br / > I hope you enjoy the movie. This isn't the case.,1
"< br / > < br / > Philistines beware, especially American ones!",1
"You know what? I give it 10 stars, up from the 3 I gave it night I saw it. The French like to say film is an art, and movies like this one prove they are right.",1
"I suppose by the standards of Hollywood pap, these comments contain merit. Unfortunately they tragically minimize amazing beauty and depth of this work and others like it from those years. Visconti's masterpiece! You will be rewarded.",1
"< br / > < br / > I don't like explicit films. I like movies where nothing ( explicitly ) happens. Personally, I can only but agree with Stephen - 12 : indulge. Now there's one thing never to do.",1
He too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures. It is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made. Dirk Bogarde gives an outstanding performance as Gustav von Aschenbach.,1
"< br / > < br / > Maybe I'm just a victim of man's desire to flaw the flawless. Unable to catch one delight, he settles for another - which poisons him. The chase in Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. It is very subtle in the book, but it is there.",1
"It may be hard to explain how, but this film is a masterpiece.",1
"It's the opulence of Visconti's films, the grandeur of the ball scenes, that I find tedious, as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision. It's the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that. It's like an allusion to Shakespeare's sonnets, and it doesn't feel heavy - handed. But here, that is part of the point - - Gustav surrounded by a visual din.",1
"The streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting filth and rot, the city decays in step with the protagonist. Only through the flashbacks are we allowed a glimpse of why this famous composer is a frail and innocuous man. Should we not perish and become consumed by love? "" But Visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of Venice. We see in the film this very thing happen, the man becomes enveloped by a longing for beauty, which turns into a longing for the boy, Tadzio.",1
and a exploration of illusion. And an agonize Venice. And the essence is the music. No way! Like every regret and every sorrow. A victim? Gustav is gay by accident.,1
"The character borders on a kind of black widow film noir type. < br / > < br / > And there's a lot of literal leaping. It descends into utter madness along with characters, but never seems exploitative or horrific without purpose. This is a really smooth and nervy performance. She careens from innocent to impish to vixen to demon with utter conviction.",1
"For those who love Venice, this is a film to cherish. Who knows? But then what else would you expect with a title like that? < br / > < br / > There is not a lot of dialogue in the film. The composer has lost a child of his own. The mood it creates is not always happy.",1
"Are sea side resorts the sad, dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels? Perhaps Tadzio reminds him of what he could have been and now knows he never will be. The film benefits from the ravishing music of Gustave Mahler, on whom Aschenbach's character is clearly based. A pedophile?",1
"In the end. the audience unlike the book is hampered with innuendos and imaginative flights of fancy. Great story and a Bogarde Classic. Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis for the film "" A Death in Venice. """,1
"He's not playing to the crowd, folks : either you get behind him and follow along, or you get left behind. This movie absolutely feels like a grand summing - up, not just of Visconti's particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. Incidents "" are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in aturm - und - drang cosmos. The pacing is a challenge : slow, but never without emotional weight. """,1
"I think both. Was it bless or curse for him? I first saw "" Death in Venice "" 1971 ) about 15 years ago, found it profoundly moving and often thought about it. He became addicted to him ; he fell in love with him.",1
I wish i could see more of Irene Joseph. Good viewing fun.,1
"It's very cool and entertaining. This comes out of Edgewood Studios in Vermont, USA. I highly recommend it to all horror buff, you'll love it!",1
The actor who played the old man was actually very good. Hitchcock? So what does one expect? I was was very entertained. But that was part of the charm of the movie.,1
"I loved it. It was a terrible movie. OK, I am a sucker.",1
He hurls lots of bugs at his cast for the finale.,1
"Thank god for that! Many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore. One thing that I liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry. I know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless ; I was, at first, a little sceptical about the plot of this movie.",1
"Why did they do that? "" I thought the film was fun. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too.",1
Tom Hanks stars along with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. While racing against time to find the path of Illuminati. It is a lot better than the movie 2010.,1
"if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though. First i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code. < br / > < br / > Second, the changes from book to film. However the BIG TWIST is still there so don't worry about that. that's okay for a film like this.",1
but the films main saving grace is it's pace.,1
He had me convinced right until the very end. I cannot say enough about score. The minor actors also do very good jobs. The final explosion sequence at the end is excellent.,1
"< br / > < br / > I like Hanks as Robert Langdon. < br / > < br / > The subject matter is no less controversial than the DaVinci Code, and the Vatican seems to never learn their lesson. < br / > < br / > It rates an 8.",1
"The action taking place in the Vatican, it felt like vacation. Still haven't read a single Dan Brown book, but I watched all his movies adaptations. < br / > < br / > I really like debate between science and religion.",1
"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind. "" Who doesn't love Hanks? Possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written! You get to tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography.",1
"You see neither of it in movie. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better.",1
< br / > < br / > The interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders. Symbologist Robert Langdon ( Hanks ) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new science experiment blows up the city.,1
It's a pretty average stuff with plenty of nudity.,1
"Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving Vatican archives. I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Some minor details are are also cut from the movie. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I am not an expert in the book, however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie.",1
"I go to the movies to be entertained. But hey, it's a movie. It had plenty of twists and turns throughout to keep me very interested.",1
"But, maybe not something too special for Dan Brown fans. If you haven't read the book, no worries you will still find it very interesting. < br / > < br / > Overall, Pretty impressive film for any everyday movie goer.",1
It was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings I have seen in a,1
"Arranging all of this is the carmelengo, Patrick McKenna ( McGregor ). < br / > < br / > The movie itself runs at an uneven pace. Tom Hanks is slightly more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the straight - faced leader of the Swiss Guard.",1
"And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye, with nuances enough to let you know there's more than meets the eye. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one.",1
x ] Ice is a brilliant first season episode. I think the whole cabin would be dead.,1
"if you liked the episode ICE I advice you to see it. Soon none can tell who they can trust, or who's infected or not. It has the abilities to imitate any life form. the plot is simple but exiting. An alien that had been buried in the ice for a 10000 years had been thawed out. The parasite attaches itself to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity.",1
"< br / > < br / > Mulder : "" Bring your mittens",1
Great job in all accounts. It really needed more episodes like this.,1
"It even allows Mulder and Scully to have moments where they're not sure if they can trust each other. Visually, color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality. This episode certainly works at portraying the way that tensions can cause breakdowns in groups. This gives rise to the inevitable scene of testing.",1
This was truly a tense and dark episode. All works. I WANTED MORE!,1
A little worm that gets into the bloodstream and causes violent behavior. Now Mulder and Scully are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened. Events lead to finding out the one who is infected and learning how to cure them. Its a shame he has to die.,1
"I haven't seen it, so I wouldn't know. Wow! It's my favorite of the season.",1
Tension is that high. A true stand out episode from season 1 is what Ice is.,1
"And, as usual, I loved the ambiguity of the ending. Highly recommended.",1
"The ones who refused to fight were executed on sight. This isn't a bad TV movie. Both men explained that they fought for their motherland, rather than the for the Soviets. Needless to say, their lives sucked. Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means Penal Batallion.",1
"Those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of the law. One can almost call it the Russian equivalent of highly acclaimed "" Band of Brothers "" miniseries. It features a colorful and varied group of people, thrust into a situation from which there is no escape.",1
"The largest front of the whole conflict has been, ironically, the least appearing subject on the silver screen after the war. Shtrafbat is the story only Russians could tell about the Second World War.",1
Characters well portrayed and unforgettable.,1
That's the story in a nutshell.,1
This is the story of one such battalion.,1
"< br / > < br / > You almost wonder in all the exhilaration of the camera flying by the trees at a high speed with the car that he might just make it. Maybe it's because I have a weak spot for heist pictures, particularly where we see just the nuts and bolts ( err, actual physical side ) of how a heist is pulled off. It becomes completely about character at points, and then keeps up the thrills.",1
"See it! Run, don't walk, to rent this movie.",1
"Elements of Bogie, Welles & Sinatra will leave you sweating & satisfied. The ultimate gritty heist film.",1
The actual heist scene is one of the best I have ever seen. This fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days. They round up the usual suspects for the job. Rififi is a great film that is overlooked.,1
< br / > < br / > Grade : A - But it's also very good.,1
"What a gas of a movie! "" Dassin picked right guy ( Jean Servais ) for that role. Film Noir "" has always been one of my favorite genres, but this one stands apart from the rest. Only their women survive, except for Ida, Mario's honey. ).",1
"For once, I can say that film is not predictable! To start with, I have done some further research on the film. Ten stars!",1
- P. Melville's films in this genre. < br / > < br / > This movie is like some lemonade I had last night. This increases the suspense and draws you in. myspace. 7. The brilliance of this film is the 1 / 2 hour during the robbery.,1
"All three of the child actors - Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby, and Andy Freeman - are chillingly convincing. < br / > < br / > Bleak, nasty, and downbeat, "" Bloody Birthday "" is worth a look for the curious.",1
American expatriate Jules Dassin makes an award - winning French gangster film.,1
"It never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it. Leave the classics alone! No other heist film has come close to it, before or after. The plot is simple, but engrosses you.",1
Too many times to mention.,1
An opportunity presents itself : an easy multi - million - dollar jewel heist that can be done at night with no fear of discovery by a few men.,1
"< br / > < br / > The heist goes off without a hitch. They enlist the services of Cesar, an Italian safe cracker - played by director Dassin himself - and we are off to the heist. Thankfully that scene occurs off camera, but you are not likely to forget it. Perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the Criterion Collection DVD restoration is impressive. I have been wanting to see this since my French teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago. But Cesar's womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned.",1
"Watching the heist sequence makes one realize the power of silence, which is unfortunately so underused in today'cinema. The fact that after 50 years, it is still a highly watchable movie, says a lot about it.",1
"< br / > < br / > A great film by a great director. The standard by which other cape films are measured. Nothing is left to chance. After blowing it with Mario, they kidnap Jo's son.",1
Jules Dassin is the master.,1
< br / > < br / > 4. And then? Of course Louis gang kidnapped the son. Then they murder Mario and his Wife. BIG QUESTIONMARK.,1
"The new Rififi DVD includes a recent interview with Dassin. Some nosy cops are efficiently dealt with. It goes like clockwork, with a fine sense of craft and teamwork among the robbers. He's one of the most memorable characters, a dandified Italian safe cracker who speaks no French. Has there ever been a heist film whose perps lived happily ever after?",1
ts as the murderers. Even the slightest bit of investigation would easily uncover these lil sh! It's a very recommendable and underrated 80s horror flick. No kiddin!,1
It shows that all kinds of bad activities result in some kind of human loss. This is a scene which nobody has dared to copy in Hollywood. That is why they adhere to a strict code of honor.,1
"< br / > < br / > In fact, I thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. This is France, not the United States, so there is a little bit of both in here. < br / > < br / > Both make this movie a bit unique, at least to English - speaking film noir fans. The best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography. A warning for those not expecting profanity or nudity in a classic film. Actually, an American, Jules Dussain, shot the film, so it's not entirely a European film.",1
"Everything goes well and the gang gets away with the jewels. Jules Dassin was penniless in Paris when he discovered the city that were going to serve as the background to his film. < br / > < br / > When we first meet Tony, he is playing cards. Upon confronting Mado, instead of love, all he feels is contempt, and the meeting ends badly and he throws her out of his place.",1
It's a film that doesn't glamorize the notion of a robbery but shows it for what it is.. theft. It shows that a heist is hard work and ultimately not worth doing. It portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with.,1
"A classic. ( It displays some of the edgy brutality of Dassin's earlier "" Brute Force "" ).",1
"< br / > < br / > In film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys. ( Here we have Remi Grutter, played by Robert Hossein, a slightly sadistic druggie. ) Then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so. < br / > < br / > Probably Or vice - versa.",1
My vote is ten. Then he calls Jo and Mario and proposes a burglary of the safe of the jewelry.,1
Pure quality.,1
"Nevertheless, this French noir - classic shouldn't be forgotten. Whatever one's opinion of the film.",1
"But they can't go on fooling everyone. I'd say its well worth seeing, ( I own a copy myself ).",1
"Builds up tense situations with precise craftsmanship. Marked the end of Dassin's period in filmmaking when he was involved in doing Noir pictures. Remarkable Noir picture that defines 1950s French Cinema. In the end Rififi ( 1955 ) is in my opinion a slightly better film than Asphalt Jungle ( 1950 ). A masterpiece in acting, cinematography, directing, editing, and writing.",1
< br / > < br / > Let you eyes be opened like those of the young protagonist.,1
"Saddened, shaking your head. Ditto for the music. 3 cheer to a young writer / director. < br / > < br / > The camera work is impressive. It affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue.",1

"Thank you for making it and redefining my view on the death penalty. Overall, a movie worth my highest praise! I cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me! If there are people that don't like this movie, I don't think they are human.",1
An incredible performance!,1

Anyhow, there is also another scene I can't let go without comment.",1
I also changed this one scene. I recognized several people I didn't see during filming also.,1
This movie is a violent black humor movie. They go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. My vote is seven.,1
"OH! Is it full moon tonight? Even they got me on that scenes. I'm a horror - movie - lover. That was really cool. I bought this movie long time ago, and I don't regret buying it. I give this movie 5 stars out of 6.",1

I didn't really find anything annoying about the acting, so thumbs up for that! It's one of the better werewolf films I have seen in a long time too. Perfect for fans of werewolves! < br / > < br / > I dare to say the opposite. So as a sequel, AAwiP fails, one would say.",1
"I liked it even though I agree "" London "" is better and I prefer that version, too. That film had it's funny moments, it was still more of horror tale than anything else. I don't see enough of this actress. This film is geared a lot more toward 20 - somethings, if that helps anyone.",1

Todd's mother is slightly insane ( on the phone 24 / 7 ), his Dad doesn't find her attractive ( any more? ) ( Well the title did give that away, wouldn't you think? ) The actors really managed to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss point of no return for Todd and Vicky.

"With her talent, Billie will go far in industry. < br / > < br / > I like that they've given the characters so much depth. The Doctor seems more vulnerable in this series, maybe because he is the last TimeLord.",1
"I'm gushing.. but this should be on everyoneci - fi geeks list. But in the case of Dr Who, they saved the best parts. ! Like Battlestar Gallactica, this is a show rebuilt from the ground up.",1

I LOVE Dr WHo SO much!,1
"The Doctor and Martha don't appear much, but that doesn't detract from a well crafted episode. For those awaiting series 3 abroad, the wait is is well worth it.",1
From season one to season two the pace is just about right... the stories can be from the outlandishly weird to the most action packed paced driven but either way its one rollercoster ride from the start of the theme song which is very catchy.,1
"However, if you insist that this isn't the same and just isn't Doctor Who, please, just stay in your basement.",1
"As soon as the credits rolled on Saturday night you could feel it in the air that the doctor was most definitely back! < br / > < br / > Watching those iconic moments where Christopher Eccelston met Billie Piper was the beginning of a huge long adventure.

My entire childhood was deprived of Doctor Who adventures ; me being a tremendous fan of most sci - fi and fantasy adventures. And I don't think they did a bad job with what they had. Honestly, i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to any future episodes. I quite liked all the aliens but my favourite had to be the Daleks ; if I ever knew I also loved Christopher Eccleston.",1

And I could not believe that it was. I loved this show.,1
I was really beginning to enjoy this show. I think it was a hasty move to cancel.,1
And was very surprised that it didn't aired. I live on the island of Aruba. But there were very talented people singing. Although i can not vote. I sat down to see the show on tuesday.,1
That this film has faded into relative obscurity is a travesty.,1
"What a beautiful and touching film! You care for the bugs, AND Dick and Mary. I was on the edge of my seat much more than with "" Up. "" Wow.",1
THe insects enemy is man. Its incredibly imaginative. The wedding scene looks beautiful. Its great and kids will love it. I loved Hoppity and the villain Mr Beatle is a real cad. Its a joy to look at.,1
Overall I love both films from the Fleischer bros. - Gulliver and Mr. Bug.,1
"Fair question. You almost don't even need spoken lines. It has a good message ( two actually ). < br / > < br / > "" Okay "", you're saying. "" People who know me say I have a weakness for animated films. < br / > < br / > My answer : Partially.",1

They will just love it.,1
I need to see this movie again.,1
"twenty moonbeam square, just a couple in castle in the air "" ). I located a reference to the movie on the web.",1
"Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those films that I grew up hearing about, however a copy could never be obtained until now. The animation is great, and many of the characters are very cute. The film was called a family favorite by most of the major American newspapers. The film was to have had its premiere on Dec. 7th, 1941, the date of the bombing of Pearl Harbor.",1
"I first watched this in black and white, circa Christmas in the early Sixties, when it was shown on British television. < br / > < br / > To compound their problems, devious insect'property magnate'C. Old Mr Bumble and his beautiful daughter Honey ( Hoppity's childhood sweetheart ) are in grave danger of losing their Honey Shop to this threat. ).",1

"- - Something unimaginable in these typically short - run, quick to - DVD days. Mr. Bug provided them the pretext to do just that. - - The sad closing of a great quirky, innovative chapter in American animation. That may have been close enough to do the trick, anyway, in terms of national mood damaging the film's success. < br / > < br / > I wanted to comment, also, that the film actually debuted December 4, 1941, not December 7.",1
The characters are lovable and charming and there is heart in this film. < br / > < br / > * * * * out of 4 stars Who knows?,1
This was one of many of his other films. Could this be one of the earliest colour films? It's just beautiful.,1

She appeared there until 1912. The version available to us now may be a later version / remake.,1
"This one is worth looking for.... It's a "" screwy "" comedy I have enjoyed many times over the years.",1
This is one to watch over and over.,1
"And I do mean Emotion with a capital E! What a wonderful, glorious pageant of color and music and raw Emotion! Everything hinges on music, of course, and when the music is magical, as it is in "" Rigoletto, "" an opera can be a magnificent entertainment.",1
The entire production is as perfect as one could expect.,1
You should have too! Luciano Pavarotti also sings splendidly. Kathleen Kuhlmann in the Contessa.,1
"It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. It also stars Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, and Herbert Marshall. It this comment containspoilers, I am unaware of it. She sent me an autographed photo. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes.",1
"It was an exciting, entertaining family film with absolutely no pretensions, hidden meanings or alternative agenda. It was fun. Mr James Robertson Justice is just a tad unbelievable as the bosun. But it is Miss Peters who stays in the memory. M. Louis Jourdan is both winsome and treacherous as her love interest.",1
"As usual with vintage Technicolor productions, the cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating.",1
"Louis Jordan was a bit weak. + + + + With a good and serious script, this could have been an excellent film. This movie was much better than I expected. But it's basically cheesy.",1
"bit as he ( or in this case "" she "", but there has been a female "" Anne "" buccaneer, Anne Boney ) might have been in brutal reality. This movie is wonderful melancholic.",1

Anne begins planning revenge on both of them but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a great sacrifice in order to save them instead. As a result a treasure of great value is captured along with a handsome French officer Pierre La Rochelle ( Louis Jourdan ), who is taken prisoner.",1
"This is because the events depicted in Dekalog 5 can happen in any part of world. An honest reviewer would not be making a mistake if he / she states that Kieslowski's film "" Dekalog : Dekalog, Piec ( # 1. There should be absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human society. It was in 1988 that Chuck Norris saw this film at Cannes International Film Festival. 5 ) "" has universal connotations.",1
"Identity.... Much of that meaning makes sense only in retrospect. < br / > < br / > The film wasn't sympathetic, per se. This should not be too strange of an idea : after all, how much of respectable science does not gain meaning in retrospect. It's still working inside me. It doesn't need to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing. What I thought before really isn't worth getting into.",1
"Later that year, Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color. Everything ends at dawn, and just when the sun is about to rise again, the skeletons run towards their graves. A lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra : it's hard to dance with loose body parts. While his work kept the same high quality, it wasn't really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed.",1
"Desperate plights don't demand desperate remedies "", Kieslowski says in his message, teaching us how unrighteous can be the act of disobedience to a commandment of God that judges punishment the same way as crime is judged. Really in the name of the innocent ones? "".",1
"It'a fantastic film and, typical of Kieslowski, absolutely stunning. With such vile characters, I found myself almost glad that they would receive some sort of punishment. It asks us what is murder, who is more guilty of murder, and what should be the appropriate punishment, if any?",1
"Their meeting is, indeed, important ; they both have to give in to it while not propagating it. His way of killing is more a desire to control death than it is any desire to actually destroy.",1
"The lawyer feels at the end he has failed his client and goes to the judge to see where he went wrong. Nothing can prevent the court to condemn to death the young man. All he is asked by the young man is to retrieve the picture and send it to his mother. The last moments of this criminal is one of the most gripping sequences in any film, past, or present.",1
We are made to imagine that this must have been the case. Three distinct and distant individuals'lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another.,1
"When television was still a young medium, there was a form of entertainment very prominent on the air that is but a memory today : musical variety. Before the Broadway phenomenon of the mid - 60's.",1
"Also included is the brief introduction she filmed in 1986, ironically dressed in all - white, when the special was first released on VHS. and "" Starting Here, Starting Now "" among them. The juxtaposition of locale and song is even more effective than in her first special, and a 23 - year old Streisand is in peak form.",1
is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting.,1
"Not surprisingly, she succeeded once again. She stops to admire various paintings and statues, often becoming the character that is depicted and singing a thematically appropriate song. In addition to the numerous artistic possibilities that this location made possible, the museum would offer the perfect opportunity to take advantage of filming in color. < br / > < br / > Once again, the special is divided into three distinct Acts.",1
What kind I say about this movie.,1
I still think so! 10 / 10 * * * * * * * * * * = greatest ever!,1
From her constant pressure on him he flees into drinking.,1
"If Cassavetes were a crazy German he might make this film, maybe even as just a lark. As he stands in the room, her family holding him back, she makes the call for divorce and he gets a heart attack right there. < br / > < br / > And yet it's in this simplicity that Fassbinder tries, and succeeds for the most part, in attaining a mood of dread, of a tense vibe in a kitchen or in the bedroom or out on the street that you can cut with a knife and bleed out.",1
"However, by doing so, he injects an almost'hyper - reality'to the narrative. Fassbinder employs his actors in an almost vehement "" Anti - Natural'style. The storyline is fairly straightforward. You are constantly on outside, looking in. I streamed this film, and the print was nearly flawless and second to none.",1
"who'd have thought ). Just what the doctor ordered. < br / > < br / > Still, this is Fassbinder, and you get your fix here. In Fassbinder's earlier films, his ideas sometimes surpased his ability to execute them.",1
"< br / > < br / > First, it's highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love pushed him into signing up with the Foreign Legion. In fact, he is more brutal in her presence. Ostensibly, Hans'isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother, a nagging wife, and a lover's rejection. Why?",1
This is also shown clearly by the way he treats his wife after a drink. The Merchant of Four Seasons is a film about a lack of love. Both films are downtrodden and gritty - yet realistic pieces of art.,1
Everything about this movie is magnificent! I remember seeing this movie back when it was released and I still remember the'buzz'I felt when I left the cinema.,1
? Happy 25th Birthday to Valley Girl!,1

I recommend this TV film to all without hesitation. What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. It is also based on a true story.,1
"Martha Coolidge herself said she only had 350, 000 dollars to work with. This is a movie that I loved growing up in the midwest. Great things about this movie.... Great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director. This is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production.",1

"Wishful thinking, I know.",1
"If you don't like it, well then "" Gag me with a spoon.",1

The soundtrack is awesome.,1
"The music was GREAT. And his hysterical friend, Cameron Dye? Nicolas Cage is just brilliant here. Bizarre! ).",1
"Although it is for me personally. It is one of Nicholas Cage's first movies and his first starring role. Girl meets boy and there are sparks from both sides, an instant connection. And she has these really cool supportive hippie parents. After it ended I wanted to talk with someone about it immediately. I am not saying this is a great classic. It was 1983 and I was 13. I am eagerly awaiting it's release on DVD if they ever release it. His friend Fred is pretty funny too. Every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it. We began to worship the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. Turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie.",1

"Audience that time was also different. Cinema was then not only one form of arts. "".",1
"They begin to see each other. Let's make that dittos for the costumes and script. One can guess the outcome. Taking place near Chicago, the neighborhood setting is likewise charming and beautiful.",1

Awesome Movie! He is easily the Cary Grant of our generation.,1
"especially considering I can count on one hand the romantic comedy films I have ever enjoyed.

Highly recommended 9 / 10.",1
IT wears well on viewing and re - viewing.,1
"I must admit that I didn't get around to seeing this movie in the theater. Minnie Driver is simply beautiful, charming, funny, and lively in her role as Grace. Jim Belushi is an absolute stitch, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real - life force. Take time rent this one..... it's well worth the effort!",1
! I am really thankful to the creators of this film. I highly recommend that you give this movie a viewing.,1
I don't think I would get tired of seeing it. See it! You will know exactly how the character feels. The casting was perfect in all respects.,1
And I love the wedding at the end.,1
"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! ! I'm just curious, why wasn't this a big hit?",1
What downer! But what did I see in this version?,1
They never make movies like this... ever! ).,1
Everyone in the movie theater was laughing and enjoying themselves. Thumbs up Bonnie Hunt!,1
I also said that about THE MATRIX and look at what happened there. And this is one of the most realistic moments of pain I have ever seen in any character in any movie. The dog lets out a small moan and then Rob cries.,1
I always want to make it a special day when I watch! ! I'm crying just thinking about it. David Duchovny's grief scene is so flippin real!!! I know them I swear! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest.,1
Return to Me is a movie you will want to own.,1

"I hope that one day, the creationism - evolution debate won't be an issue. Also starring Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbat.",1
Charles Darwin begins a war with an utterly predictable ending. War with God. As this movie unfolds you start to feel the conundrum of human existence.,1
"Creation examines that pain, and the realisation that we are all that we possess. This film portrays that barrier supremely well. Was he in some way responsible for her death? The truth, once it was discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many.",1
Boris is promptly sent off to war. This is definitely movie that everyone should see.,1
The history carried the day and the actors did their job. He is what he is.,1
"He was said at the time to be going to war against God, and even to have "" killed God "". She is convinced that he will be eternally damned and bring misfortune to their family by rejecting God. In my opinion this part was too long, bizarre and drawn out. She stays up reading it nights on end and finally presents him with a package, the book ready to be sent to its publisher. Their bond is solid and unbreakable despite tremendous differences of belief. < br / > < br / > The film revolves around Darwin's life with his wife and four children. < br / > < br / > Annie, the eldest child, later dies and Charles becomes haunted by her death, having been closest to her.",1
"Clearly, not what I expected from a movie about Darwin, albeit the movie was beautifully interpreted. For that, he deserves all the credit.",1
"Well, I'm sure there's a meaning too it, just don't let it scare you away. < br / > < br / > I give this movie a 9 / 10. The story is about Darwin and his daughter, and it is beautifully acted. A hard thing to do in my opinion. Een more than him at times. The movie talks about evolution, and that's it. I doubt it is an irony, the movie is too respectful for that. < br / > < br / > Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible.",1
"Wow! Fantastic film in my opinion, i wasn't expecting it to be this good!",1
"A bit of a romantic weepie, actually. I saw this film on 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival.",1
"She plays the precocious young girl to a tee. < br / > < br / > All in all a great film, and although it is a period drama issues that drive it are still very much alive today. I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest, this is a great film.",1
"Equally magnificent is Connelly's work playing the religious wife of a man who, in Huxley's words, "" killed God "". Their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end, but develops transcendence as Darwin grapples with his demons. The world premiere audience at the TIFF was spellbound. Simply put, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. < br / > < br / >rilliant.",1
All this was the result of the setting up of television relay stations across the entire Indian nation. It was also continued by her son Rajiv Gandhi. This sitcom was a big crowd puller in the year 1984 - 1985.,1
i was a huge fan of this series. I give it 10 / 10.,1
"Very daring too, because so close to "" over the top. "" The pre - war and post - war scenes have a very 1957 feel. < br / > < br / > Go for it. But that scene will stay with you. There is no attempt at period detail.",1
I would wish if someone could list all the episodes here. I am 35 and he is 17. Satish Shah is hilarious in multiple roles. I saw this title again on Shemaroo. < br / > < br / > I still like this sitcom. The life of common people.,1
Anyone who's found of genuinely good comedy ought to go and get this series.,1
Rakesh Bedi hams throughout. The mother of all TV comedies. And it worked during the age and time! The main event.,1
"It's taken years for cult icon Bruce Campbell to get this project off the ground - but he finally has, it's here - and what a great piece of schlock entertainment it is! The humour is mostly of the slapstick variety, and anyone who enjoyed Evil Dead II ( which should be anyone who's seen it ), will no doubt enjoy this too. Looking at the plot ; it sounds like two things. < br / > < br / > The first half hour or so is entertaining and features few laughs ; but once the main plot point has been executed ; the movie really picks up. Besides that, no disrespect to the man ; but he's never been the actor with the greatest range.",1
"Attention, I compare this scene with the scene form the Fly 2 where his dog as a monster dies. If you are generally interested in movies, you might wanna. A so called B movie. Makes you think oh my god.",1
< br / > < br / > The acting is better than expected. Stacy Keach is embedded in his character.,1
"I liked it, anyway. - when a woman kills him.",1
Definite worth a watch.,1
The acting is actually pretty good.,1
"What more can I say? But it could have happened anytime, anywhere. It is not just pure technique. It's a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the Second World War.",1
"Yegor for his part is stuck in William's head who's likes and dislikes, in both food and drink, are totally opposite to his own. This causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains in them fighting for control of William's body! It's there that William wants to help finance Bulgaria's almost non - existent mass transportation system. Dr. Ivanov has this theory in that two heads are better then one.",1
"You did the best with what you had. I, personally, love Bruce Campbell movies. ; | Way to go Ted!",1
"The movie was cheesy in the best possible way. Who knew that Ted could rap? Thanks Bruce. ( Hey, I'm a dork too. )",1
"The movie has all the great Bruce Campbell slap stick and humor. I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. If you are fan of Bruce, I highly recommend it. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. Its campy and very funny.",1
This was a funny movie.,1
Complete funny. Never a point of scary. Bruce sees doctor. < br / > < br / > If you like the silly Bruce Campbell you'll like this. < br / > < br / > The idea of the movie is simple.,1
"< br / > < br / > Thanks Bruce for your brain, this is your baby!",1
"It's fun. It's a wonderful silly'b'- movie. Okay, so I love silly movies.",1
"Just one funny scene after another. He was great! B sure to check it out on the Sci - Fi channel this fall. Anyway, loved film. I highly recommend this one.",1
"Unlike big budget movies that crate huge plot holes and never acknowledge them. But that is not the point. These are the kinds of movies I loved, and still love growing up.",1
"It truly adds an immediacy to the story. I am humbled and grateful to see this film. Slow to start, it picks up nicely once war is declared. That's when I came across this gem. And the camera - work!",1
< br / > < br / > The Man With The Screaming Brain is an incredibly funny film.,1
"I went to see this movie at a book signing in Lexington, Ky last night. and the setting was both near - original and fun! Come on guys! ).",1
< br / > < br / > Hai The King Baby! I don't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad. It Was Great.,1
"I was completely mistaken. The crowd was definitely excited with each little turn that the movie took. Bruce Campbell was as amazing as ever. The movie itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers. Also, anybody that likes campy sci - fi movies, do yourself a favor and watch this. Can't wait till this makes it out to DVD.",1
"But I admire the courage to throw away a script, turn the camera on, and act a fool. This film looks like fun.",1
Every wobbly shot a work of art (? It's all I can say. It's a true classic. ).,1
It's got humour.,1
"Awesome plot, huh? Nobody is meaner. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero.",1
!,1
This is a fantastic film.,1
"The Dresser "" is perhaps the most refined of backstage films. This is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious.",1
A fun dumb movie!,1
"It was a guilty pleasure, great fun and best to watch it with friends.",1
"Make sure your copy is unrated. The apparel is great, and the sets are full of 70's style. < br / > < br / > SPOILER - - the end fight scene is pretty crazy, with Dolemite ripping the heart out of Willy Green.",1
The Godfather Part II.... D'Urville Martin's Dolemite.,1
"Lord, Rudy Ray Moore and D'Urville Martin really put this one together didn't they? Of course, seeing a few boom mikes doesn't mean anything, does it?",1
"The Slang. He was a blue comic, doing blue humor. James Bond. "" Yeah... In fact, he says he always imagined himself as a black guy in Southern Cal. The Haircuts.",1
"Citizen Kane this may not be nor Les Infant Au Revoir, but this is undoubtedly genius in it's own right. It works. The production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects.",1

"I became addicted. Action, romance, crooked cops, violence.",1
"Moore's unique comedy raps, actually toasts, are close to the roots of hip hop. < br / > < br / > Number one, there is no other movie like it. Dolemite is, for me, an object of my deepest affection.",1
DOLEMITE! Self produced and marketed he catered towards a specific audience. What's the man's name?,1
What a trip down memory lane.,1
"However, two racist white cops try to frame him up again and have him thrown back in jail. Why? In other words, Dolemite is a must - see. The scenes with these characters are all priceless. Who cares ultimately? Supporting characters wander in and out of the film. It seems he couldn't decide which one.",1
The story line is great too.,1
< br / > < br / > but i could never accomplish such a feat. what an adventure that was.,1
This is one of the best documentaries of the past few years.,1
"Even the factory that Boris and his friend Stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude. < br / > < br / > Communist Russia shows how involved all were in the war. Inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage, the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable. Director Mikhail Kalatozov's film The Cranes are Flying ( Letyat zhuravli ) is a glorious piece of cinema. < br / > < br / > The acting is top - notch throughout, but some deserve singling out. An entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration.",1
"Quite a major minor character. A man, truly at sea. Instead the emotions here are as profound and turbulent as the seas featured. Even if you don't typically enjoy documentaries, odds are you will find this one fascinating.",1
"Well it's time you do. Psyche stretched to the breaking point ( and beyond ). His ship leaks. Don't do it! Crowhurst finds himself lost in an internal struggle with no successful way out. Equipment breaks. You'll note the term "" unproven captain "" in there, too. ""? It is interesting, too, to see the psychological breaks that other racers have as they deal with their solitary confinement on - board their respective boats.",1
"It is worth the effort to find. Those odds were stacked by Mother Nature, the media and his own mind.",1
"From there he would rejoin the race. Don't read this or any other information on Crowhurst or the race. If you don't know his story, it may be best to stop reading now. Find the film and just watch it. He chose to hide out, alone on his yacht, waiting for other competitors to round Cape Horn in South America. Its furies are boundless, not least of which, her loneliness. This time the journey would have to be done without making landfall or stopping along the way.",1
"I had no idea that it's a female director and that just came as a very nice surprise. This is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts. < br / > < br / > Everything could take its toll, especially the sea.",1
"He HAD to win. "" Each boat was different as allowed by the race rules. < br / > < br / Emotions include anger, sadness, and disbelief. < br / > < br / > DVD Rating : B + / 4 out of 5 / 8 out of 10 / Worth the time. The era : late 1960's.",1
Why are we so sympathetic to him? Note : This should probably be read only after watching the film. All for what? Perhaps.,1
"< br / > < br / > It's a must see, whether you like documentaries or not. I happened upon this by chance.",1
"( Think Eddie the Eagle losing endless Olympic ski jump competitions, and the amateur riders who regularly start the Grand National horse race. ) I remember the events of this movie, the ill fated cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968, in the Golden Globe single handed around the world yacht race. Chichester became a national hero, but he had stopped half way, in Australia, to re - fit his yacht, so the next logical step for yachtsmen was to attempt the journey without stopping. As Donald Crowhurst did. The previous year Francis Chichester ( later Sir Francis ; he was knighted for his exploits ) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe.",1
"10 out of. Samojlova does a magnificent job, and her character transformation will break your heart. It is a portrayal of lost innocence.",1
As a Film Four production - the anticipated quality was indeed delivered. This is a gem.,1
Deep Water examines the pressures and ambitions on an ordinary man in a compelling documentary.,1
The archive footage and the interviews are fascinating and bring the story to life.,1
"good job, Lionel Barrymore!!! ! this was a truly entertaining film.",1
"Then she meets Eddie, who's very different from the dashing Carlton. ( Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s. )",1
"This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme. Plus, it was well - paced and suited its relatively short run time. She really doesn't like the work, but it's a living. < br / > < br / > Overall, the film is interesting and thought - provoking. Give this one a look.",1
"< br / > < br / > Stanwyck is the best thing about this movie ; in one of her earliest roles she's quite accomplished. She and Owsley marry, but keep it a secret, while she dismisses Cortez, who still holds out hope. This relic from before the days of the Production Code and the Hays Office is good fun, not great but entertaining. I know, it's pretty funny.... ).",1
"Gummo is good, River's Edge is way, way better. Then there's Crispin Glover. Its brilliant. No, in fact, he's a horrendous actor.",1
"As murderer John, Roebuck is frighteningly emotionless. < br / > < br / > The film is overall fantastic and daring. River's Edge "" was promoted as a teen exploitation flick but was in actuality much better. Ione Skye is equally sympathetic and likable.",1
He drives around town in a state of complete paranoia after murder. Crispin Glover is his usual whacked - out self. River's Edge is more than just the story of a murder. When do these kids get lost? What makes so many of them want to act anti - social?,1
"< br / > < br / > But Man is not a bird. Again Veronica is among them, forcing her way through a wall of bodies. Surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract Boris'attention must inevitably fail.",1
"Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney, and Tony is Dolph.",1
I really enjoyed it watching.,1
Yeah. Turns out this movie is about my dad & his friends.,1
"It gave me nightmares. < br / > < br / > Also, fight the good fight to great Dennis Hopper. Yet it's hard to look away from a car accident. I have seen this movie three times. You're one of the best! His acting capabilities in this film were amazing.",1
Much of film's attention is focused on a reckless murder committed by a feckless teenager. This is one of the most outstanding films made by American director Tim Hunter.,1
"Although I was hoping that I'd like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film.",1
"Dennis Hopper effortlessly steals the movie. "" Next, how the heck does Layne just walk out of the police station near the end? He spends the rest of the film being chaffeured around by Layne or Feck. His speeches are so overwrought they are laughable. The scenes in Burkewaite's class are excruciating. "". I finally saw this on video, after years of hearing about it. He gives Feck an internal logic that makes the story work.",1
The reality that Russian nukes could wipe you out at any time. One of the most memorable movies I have ever seen.,1
It was real nice for a change. Every actor did great at..... acting. But Feck had loved girl he had killed.,1
"Boris, meanwhile, is killed in action. It's not difficult, after watching this film, to see why post - silent Soviet cinema is held in such little critical esteem. Don't get me wrong.",1
"With top notch acting by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper, we are able to forgive the average acting by everyone else in the film. However, we do see the reaction of the younger sister. You may think this is unrealistic, but this is what happened in the real story. Samson eventually shows the body to his friends. She cries and screams while her mother consoles her. Despite all of this, no one goes to the police.",1
"Joshua John Millar is quite good and so is Ione Skye. What eventuates is quite numbing, haunting and downright cold.",1
"Some of the characters'backgrounds may be a little too subtle. Mr. Hopper once killed a woman. Make other quirky connections on your own. He lives with one of those life - sized sex dolls, with a mouth apparently ready for action.",1
"I'm not sure how accurate it is, though. It seems that murder is trivial now. This is what River's Edge shows. He says he loved the girl that he killed. I still have no idea.",1
"I think it is creepy and completely weird. I disliked some, but genuinely felt sorry for others ( Keanu Reeves ). Crispin Glover as always gave a great performance as Layne. I'm not sure whether i like this film or not.",1
"But I have to type something. Funny lines galore. < br / > < br / > Still best stoner film, it is much more than just that.",1
This movie is a hidden gem! I fell upon it while switching around the tv one night.,1
"AMEN. After reading some of these reviews, it is apparent that some have missed the point. It is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self.",1
It's a true movie experience which I will never forget. It's honest. Great job. The acting is real. Every scene is classic.,1
"9 / 10. Would things be different?. All in all a few interesting social commentaries are presented, and there are no solutions.",1
Thankfully! Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. The actors are terrific. Her fiancé Boris is sweet and patriotic. I can't describe the sorrow of this scene...,1
"They seem empty, hopeless. 9 / 10. The lack of real emotion from most of the characters is very disturbing. The story is based on a real event. No one reports the murder. Only twelve and no compassion or love factor in his life.",1
"Overall, this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth seeing! The film begins with a murder. The film features a very gritty picture which bodes well with its nihilistic tone. Crispin Glover is the biggest standout as the slightly insane Layne.",1
"Or, Josh Miller, who plays Reeve's little brother, Tim. It is definitely not peppy 80s teen fare, obviously.",1
< br / > < br / > It is interesting from several aspects. Be prepared to feel unsettled at end. It has retained it power. One is that it is based on a true story. I just saw this movie for the second time.,1
The opening shot was brilliant. Super stuff!,1
"This drama hits hard and is impossible to forget. The young cast does a creditable job - even Keanu Reeves, in one of his earliest roles, is better than usual. It's too saddening for that. Veteran Dennis Hopper has an especially good role as a loner who despite his own sordid past is saddened by the attitudes of this group of kids.",1
Given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing. Fantastic. Should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools.,1
"Dafoe is anything but devilish as Gas, a deceiving garage mechanic. and placed it into certain parts of the story with some good timing. One of the movie's best scenes is witnessing Ted eat ( fish and frogs ) and construct a gun and admit to Allegra - "" I can't help myself. """,1
Now i watch it at least once a month.,1
"Love, as a cinematic concept, is too - often idealised as a notion that somehow conquers all and endures endless hardship, and yet the reality is substantially less romantic. Driven to betrayal by the unending torment and uncertainty of waiting, Veronika agrees to wed Boris'cousin, Mark ( Aleksandr Shvorin ), a handsome but unworthy youth. < br / > < br / >'The Cranes are Flying'is both an invigorating visual feast and an audacious, humanistic portrayal of war. The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema.",1
"Not even the game's author knows. eXistenZ "" is classic Cronenberg.",1
Definite worth seeing.,1
I loved this movie but then again I am a big Cronenberg fan.,1
"definitely watch this movie. i was blown away. they don't get it's appeal. the ending was interesting, and not overdone. i adore it and would watch it again. why don't you write about movies you like, like me. i have seen this movie 2 and a half times.",1
Is this really the end?,1
Probably the best performance I have ever seen Jude Law play.,1
But after watching it i can gladly say it has impressed me greatly.,1
"Superb camera - work and wonderful set pieces by director Kalatozov. Mark, Boris'cousin, rapes Veronika who feels obligated to marry him. ( A few spoilers - but for the ending, you'll have to watch the movie! )",1
The twists are excessive. It is like a game.,1
And it actually works effectively. I won't bother trying to give even the bare bones of a plot synopsis here because it'll only cause more confusion.,1
But one thing the film has is undeniable originality. < br / > < br / > Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while. ). All of the usual elements are here. ` eXistenZ'leads to a conclusion that can be responded to in several ways. We see the film through his perspective. - being consumed by a question mark?!?!?!,1
),1
"Ian Ho This film is unbelievable and, whilst highly entertaining, offers so much more than that. Jude Law is also good and is very convincing in his character'fear of implantation. Besides, if he wanted to make an unwatchable film, he'd know how to do it a lot better than this. David Cronenberg has a talent for this as he does so many things.",1
"In 1999, you're penetrated by a game. The plot? "" The producers of this picture are Hungarians. < br / > < br / > Let's consider this movie as'A History Of Violence'science - fictional sibling. Welcome to Canada! )",1
"The movie is also still made entertaining and has a good fast pace. < br / > < br / > The movie is not only just weird though. It doesn't ever allow the movie to get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. Just when you thought you figured things out, another surprise awaits around the corner. < br / > < br / > The movie is well cast, with Jude Law It's virtual reality taken to a whole other level. You just never really know what is the reality and what is the game - world, right till the ending. < br / > < br / > "" eXistenZ "" is a movie that knows to constantly fool you.",1
"< br / > < br / > But what for? Cronenberg is questioning reality AND criticizing game play. For what it's worth, this film causes a reaction in you.",1
"She is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of World War II in Moscow. Reminded me, in style, of another great Russian film, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER.",1
"In the end, the film does not resolve the doubt about whether or not this is "" real "" but the point is clear ( to me anyway ). Ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates reality. Existenz means Da - sein : You are there. You are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at every level. And its common game motifs express A virtual game within the game is titled "" TranscendenZ "". Also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence.",1
What is real and what is unreal and how you tell the difference. ( Looks great in a short black skirt too. ) Cronenberg is possibly the Alfred Hitchcock of theci - fi / horror genre. No matter what film he makes he is always worth watching. The last line of the film is superbly ambiguous. Or not. So says Ted Pikul in the film.,1
"For Baudrillard, `. simulations or simulacra, have become hyperreal, more than real. In this context the technology is able to be part of human body. eXistenZ is a virtual realty simulation of man's existence.",1
I don't know. This film is cool. This film is great.,1
"The film shows some pretty disgusting stuff, but is unusually low - key in the gore department in comparison to Cronenbergs other work. Try not to read too much about the plot, or it'll be ruined for you. He proved this with films as The Fly, Naked Lunch, Crash and eXitenZ ( capital X, capital Z ) and more recently, Spider. < br / > < br / > The acting gets two thumbs up as well. It's best to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. The shock effects he plays on are never over the top and the plot progression is very intelligent and creative.",1
"The 13th Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo - jumbo thrown in. As Allegra comments about the real world, "" there's nothing going on here. "" Seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves another viewing. Living "" in the game "" is not living at all, but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth.",1
"Probably "" Okul "" is the first turkish horror film. I advice all of you not to miss this movie...",1
I've watched the movie actually several times.,1
"That'exactly how it goes! Most of them even if not all. < br / > < br / > It's NOT a waste of your time, go and watch it! The scenes that are meant to scare are somewhat cheap, and Hollywoodish.",1
A love movie using horror thema. It has original scenario.,1
"Now just having seen it 40 years later, I have no reason to change my mind. That makes it all the more remarkable.",1
< br / > < br / > Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely marvelous ; brilliant. This is one of my three all - time favorite movies.,1
It was a great movie all around.,1
"It has a nice plot and some young, bright actors in it. This time it seems they had what they needed and used them well. So these make the movie one of the best Turk movies made in the last years.",1
"Matt Cimber's commendably tactless and tasteless direction delivers the junky goods by slimy bucketful, thus making this film a hugely enjoyable serving of celluloid grime. in some typically humdrum California small town.",1
"Actually, its pretty hilarious.",1
"I love it, my rating 10 / 10. ?",1
"The "" Genie "" is actually an Angel who is there to help Pelswick learn lessons in life. I started to watch this show by accident, but I love it.",1
< br / > < br / > Mr. Razbin! We'd never fell so relax then before from watching this movie.,1
"She struggles to deal with life, her demons, and her fears. Emily soon discovered she had the power to do something about it. She watched her Dad leave her motherless.",1
< br / > < br / > Episode 2 was even better than the first one! I can't wait to see Episode 4... or the rest of the series for that matter. The father was creepy and played perfectly. No other words describe it! WOW! I am very impressed with the actors already. < br / > < br / > This episode was FREAKING AWESOME! The animation was superb. I love the character progression.,1
< br / > < br / > High recommended.,1
This new movie by Jeskid is awesome! Check it out and you'll be amazed.,1
"He, however, is an aspiring concert pianist bitter about the war having curtailed his chances for success and, knowing too that the girl's still devoted to the soldier, begins to neglect her. < br / > < br / > Disappointingly, the ). I had long wanted to watch this romantic drama ( with a WWII setting ) and, now that I have, all I can say is that it's a veritable masterpiece of Russian cinema!",1
Owen is jealous of Alicia. Now Owen hangs around with Bob AND Alicia. What happened next? Did anyone get married?? He likes hanging around with Bob. I loved Heather too.,1
The two supporting actresses also added well to the mix.,1
"She says no. "" < br / > < br / > I laughed so hard I cried. Then they realize that they're attracted to each other and start dating.",1
I did enjoy the 80's retrospect journey the movie intakes.,1
"Whilst the'Wedding Singer'was portraying the pop side of the 80's,'Rock Star'is all about metal. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of Rock'n Roll! The music is fantastic and the concerts are directed brilliantly! < br / > < br / > Great direction and a brilliant performance by Marky Mark, who acts like a true metal dude! When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day.",1
"Well, I strongly recommend this anyway! That's why this movie is like a gift from God! ).",1
"In "" Letyat Zhuravli "", she is unforgettable.",1
This was an interesting movie.,1
"Semi - chick flick but my husband enjoyed it too. Like a diamond, this movie shines. There'some laughs thrown in too. You won't waste your popcorn on this one.",1
He's only boyee who survived the De - sharted.,1
See this movie. Did I like Rock Star? Oh yes.,1
And then when he gets gig for lead singer his world changes upside down. !,1
"I was surprised to have liked it more than I originally thought I would. But, I digress.",1
Everyone is nice.,1
I seen this movie when it came out. I thought what an average movie. This is a great movie and great soundtrack.,1
"Fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack. WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! Well, almost. < br / > < br / > 8 / 10 on my personal scale. Worth seeing - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. If you don't like this kind of music, you may chose to avoid this film. He is not only playing their music to the note, but also living the life of his idols.",1
"That is one of the film's strengths, the concert footage. What to say about a movie like Rock Star? It is also the reason why I loved this movie so. < br / > < br / > But it isn't a great movie. It was a great time for metal heads. None. This is the type of movie that is almost tailer made for the critics to slam. It also gets a 10 of 10 for pure entertainment. You will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love that?",1
"The speech in the last scene makes another great example of anti - war movie. However, Veronika does not forget Boris, and keeps waiting for him.",1
However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change....,1
"I've only seen it recently and completely fell in love with it! That could have been worked on a bit better, but not a major biggie. One thing that did bother me a bit was Jennifer Aniston's performance.",1
Definitely worth checking out. Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.,1
The acting was great by Mark Wahlberg. 8 of 10 for great acting awesome music. Its all about being a rockstar.,1
"The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable. Again, not big deal. INXS'Devil Inside was from 1987 and AC / DC's Are You Ready was from 1990, among other mistakes. ).",1
"More interaction with these life - long Rock musicians would have amplified and solidified Izzy's new surroundings. Wahlberg's "" Izzy "" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true. < br / > < br / > Naturally, ROCK STAR is filled with great music.",1
The film details the various ordeals of being a rock star. He then receives a phone call. It's the Steel Dragon band.,1
"I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball "" Almost Famous "".",1
< br / > < br / > 9 /. This movie is great!,1
"This is one of the best action films I have seen. Both Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse, Brian Cox, sweet little Yvonne Zima and newcomers, sexy Craig Bierko, and Melina Kanakaredes.",1
"It is sublime and beautifully filmed. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of losses not just from the movies and the books. "" I walked the same streets, squares, and bridges over the Moskva River.",1
Is Geena hot or what? Elsewhere TV image. I still love the makeup scene.,1
"Overall : if one hasn't seen this one yet, don't forget to rent it for the next quiet Saturday night! Personally I think the turn - off at the box - office might have been the "" Woman as an action star "" - theme. Well, give her a chance, because Davis does deliver a performance above par. and on the plot ( from Shane Black, the writer of "" Lethal Weapon "" and "" The Last Boy Scout "".",1
! I love this film...! The f / x are great! It's halarious!!! I've seen it 1000 x on dvd and I cant say enough about it.,1
"I think Shane Black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever! Geena Davies is great, Samual L Jackson is even greater. Don't miss it!",1
"wouldn't you agree? I got me to care, because its makers cared. BUt I don't have that problem with this movie. Sure, there are better movies. In no way do I seek to minimize the loss. 99. "" What a funny screenplay!",1
Go Geena!,1
That turned out to be a great decision.,1
pretty impressive visually though the kid got on my nerves at the end ( watch out of the cars! ) This is movie is actually one of my all time favorites.,1
Some things are unrealistic. Acting : Samuel L Jackson is entertaining in almost any role. 2. The Action : This is a very action packed movie.,1
Now they make a great duo. You won't disappointed.,1
"No, I'm serious!",1
"The mother / schoolteacher with the quiet family life? She hires Samuel L. Jackson, who is a former police officer. Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this film! Or a combination of both? Especially, since the bad guys grab Geena's daughter.",1
"A bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd. The violence is bloody. I call it honesty. The plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films. There is a serious scene in this movie. Here, that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive.",1
The cast in this film crackles. It packs so many thrills and its so funny. If Baffles me how anyone could not like this film. !,1
I thought she did an excellent ( thats an understatement ) job in this movie. I'm one of those girls who will NEVER BE A VICTIM......................,1
"Watch it, you won't be sorry. SO worth your time. But now, can Charly and Sam, two completely different women, possibly exist in the same body? Craig is also irresistible as Timothy, the sexy bad guy with no conscience.",1
< br / > < br / > I would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > The basic plot? For me, The Long Kiss Goodnight was an enjoyable journey to find out. Thin, to be truthful. As her memory returns, so do the people who want the assassin dead. In another's hands, the character of Timothy could've been just another interchangeable villain.",1
Good fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.,1
"He does a great job of playing the unwitting sidekick to Geena Davis'tough character. It's a fantastic story with lots of unexpected twists and turns, and it's extremely well directed and acted. Watch it.",1
< br / > < br / > I love the film. This is a film that in no way reflects the real world.,1
The movie itself was an all - around good time.,1
"It may have failed simply because of its title. - talking about "" the long kiss goodnight "" will get you nowhere. That was a compliment.",1
"Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry. Violent, but not gory.",1
"The poor schmuck gets dragged along on this crazy woman's odyssey to uncover the dangerous secret of her past. < br / > < br / > The chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel. Never a dull moment. ( She's even funnier that Charly. ) In TLKG, Jackson is the everyman we identify with.",1
"Her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part. If anything, he looks drastically younger than 40. I only wish a more worthy Ophelia could have been found. What more can be said?",1
"You believe he IS Hamlet. If you don't like Shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version. The nuanced performance that Sir Derek gives will leave you breathless.",1
"Really, one of the very best ever made.",1
Orson Welles Hamlet is OK - but this BBC Hamlet is the best!,1
"I feel no sympathy for him, and I didn't after watching this.",1
"Well, I struggled with it. Amazing. Olivier seemed far too old, not only in his looks but in his acting of the part. What a revelation this play now is for me! Yes, it is splendid, but I feel it needs an actor you can emphathise with to play Hamlet and this for me is Jacobi. Something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off. < br / > < br / > And now I'm going to watch it all over again.... < br / > < br / > I heard of the Branagh full length version of Hamlet. I was never in the past interested in this play although love Shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school. I'm interested to discover Jacobi has trained Branagh as yes, you can certainly see the influence.",1
"Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind. I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars. < br / > < br / > Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatre'longest and most impossible role. I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I've done that before.",1
"WHY? His own HUBRIS is his undoing. He wants it ALL! Hamlet OVERREACHES himself in classic tragic form. And this is true even after he hears his father's ghost cry vengeance. < br / > < br / > Why does Hamlet not kill Claudius immediately? He is, therefore, impotent to do anything about it.",1
Amazing.,1
It gets very high rating from viewers. Most excellent Derek Jacobi made Hamlet * real * for me. Jacobi's rendition attracted me to a deeper knowledge. It's the only Hamlet that I'd invest in...,1
Super acting all around.,1
"And it works. Here it is presented in its entirety, a rarity on film. < br / > < br / > Jacobi's portrayal of the disturbed Prince is multi - layered and riveting. This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is by far the best that I have seen. But, oddly enough, I never noticed the time. Together the cast present a seamless ensemble. I suspect that you will, too.",1
).,1
"He deepens, rather than solves, every puzzle regarding Hamlet's character. I've seen various Hamlets, and I've taught the play.",1
"In this case, two women who happen to be due an inheritance in Southern California. This film is a displaced gem and well - worth purchasing. 10 / 10. The audience learns, we truly don't know what lurks in the dark side of the human mind.",1
"But these are minor flaws in an otherwise enjoyable and well - made movie. Also, the Mona Freeman character is not unlike the odious Veda in Mildred Pierce.",1
"He lives in a house with three women, so watch out! So what happens here?",1
"But Scott is dispatched too quickly. beautifully. That makes sense. Robert Florey and James Wong Howe gave this a frightening, Expressionistic look.",1
"Scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. The acting truly elevates it. Scott throws himself at Emerson, and she's dazzled.",1
"Ronnie wins the hearts of all the ladies in the picture, even Mona Freeman ( Anne Fenchurch ) and proposes marriage whenever he can. This film was full of suspense and was well directed, the black and white effect made it a great mystery.",1
"the second half, moved me to tears. in the end only 2 of the 9 escapees are left. they later find out that there wasn't much there and set off on their own ways. it is a comedic yet serious part of the journey. a beautiful film directed fantastically.",1
"< br / > < br / > Though a very pessimistic film, it is not a dark film. They decide to stay together travelling with their red van across Japan. punishment for their "" crimes "".",1
Their crimes are as varied as their apparent fates. A great film. will society accept them? The actors give credible performances all around.,1
It's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war.,1
Music is also spot - on. )!,1
Keep an eye out in 2005 for 9 SOULS ; it's really amazing film to watch. What soon follows is not surprising. < br / > < br / > I must give props to Artsmagic DVD as well. This film was full of excellent acting from top to bottom.,1
"Third time lucky. Only to discover that my timer went off late and again I missed the first half of the flick. On this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled. Finally! They think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills. I would have just watched the film, but they always put on weeknights around midnight.",1
"On R1 DVD of "" 9 Souls "", there are two interviews with Toyoda. I loved every second of it. It becomes more dramatic as each of the characters face their own tragedies. Now. < br / > < br / > I highly recommend this film.",1
"At 2 hours, this film is a ta to long, but good none the less. Each has their own dreams. All of the actors give great performances.",1
"It is about hierarchy, and rule, and of the consequences of failing to live up to the responsibility that rule entails. < br / > < br / > Daimajin is a perfect example of why Japanese cinema is so glorious.",1
Evil warlord puts a town through pain and suffering.,1
"There are several disturbing scenes in film. < br / > < br / > So, be careful with your samurai sword. < br / > < br / > Grade A Overall, a powerful and serious, yet hopeful film. Therefore, it is not the casual sci - fi film. You wouldn't want to rattle Daimajin's cages. It is about a samurai lord who was murdered by one of his own men.",1
"< br / > < br / > No masterpiece but an unusual combo fantasy / horror film. Worth catching - - but not if it's dubbed print. They paired it with the first sequel "" Return of the Ginat Majin "". Technically it isn't horror... until the statue comes to life at the end. It's just about a village ruled over by an evil man. < br / > < br / > Now I haven't seen it since then... but it never left me. Like another poster mentioned Ch.",1
"Stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with an individual, bold leader who was successful at killing many of the enemy, an obvious reference to Stalin himself, who was always portrayed in film as a bold, wise and victorious leader.",1

"The DAIMAJIN trilogy, circa 1966, was just such a series.",1
"Fujio Morita'sharp, moody cinematography likewise hits the bull's eye. The giant stone statue Majin eventually comes to life to destroy Samanosuke and his wicked minions. Highly recommended.",1
Guess what? It's a pretty damn good movie!,1
"if u love martial art movies this is a not to miss. It involves Ninjas,haoulin and nuns fighters.",1
"I've just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days, and must urge you to beg steal or borrow it. This movie is very well choreographed, has some nudity, some gore and enough balls to the wall gimickry to keep even the most jaded viewer entertained. We all know how this is going to end, but it's the psychedelic trip in between that we're here for. < br / > < br / > Visit your local Beewise today!",1

This is a MUST BUY for every video collection!,1
"Either you must know why it is you live, or everything is trivial - mere pointless nonsense. "" It is perhaps this thinking that prompts her to her final act in the film. Better to assign a meaning, to live as if one's life is significant, and not to give in to despair. Young lovers are separated by war ; bad things happen to both. We've seen it many times before.",1
"This movie seemed to be on a tight type budget. The family was in debt, right? But I liked it. Ha!",1
Some of her images were used for PR. The Kids were wonderful to work with and little Emma Roberts has so much energy she's a real trip.,1

Like the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy. Thanks!,1
"Finally "", I said to myself, "" A network television program truly worth watching!!! By now I was saying to myself "" What the heck is THIS?? Leave it to the networks - - I should have known.

"There are so few movies suitable for young children... but this one is, and it's great. He called the film his "" love letter to Texas. "" The film is excellent!",1
Grand Champion is a bit old fashion at first glance.,1
The graphics were really good. They made the movie seem partially realistic. All in all I'd watch it again. With the help of their handsome prince. This is a new Barbie movie. It had a great classical orchestra.,1

I definitely recommend this movie for all young girls.,1

"Anyone can have fun with it, though, because it is so cute and understandable. I thought this movie was perfect for little girls.",1
This movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate. It teaches a good lesson as well. I can't get enough of it.,1

Oh, well. Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again. And don't count the awful Mr. Magoo reworked for live action. That was strictly a one - joke moment but they had to use it in all six episodes.",1
"Supposedly United Artists tinkered with a further cut in the hopes of getting some of their money back. There are times when things go on and on and on and nothing happens. Much of the longer version seems to be on screen simply because it looked good. < br / > < br / > The problem is entirely in the editing which should be labeled as the final word on excess. Whether it was ever done or still exists is up in the air, but it would be interesting to see.",1
"There is a great cast that also has Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif and a young Mickey Rourke.",1
It is stunning.,1
"What a spectacle that would be! Don't miss it, if you ever have the chance.",1
"Most of the time, they are far too costly to produce to be anything else. < br / > < br / > By nature, a film editor, I am deeply frustrated by two problems with this film. There are always many film - goers who dislike long, weighty pictures. A lot of folks don't react all that favorably to this approach. They want story to move quickly and clearly and they easily become impatient and confused by this sort of film. These factors doubtless contributed to the box - office failure of "" Heaven's Gate "".",1
I was mesmerised by the breadth and the sheer beauty of so much of the photography. There was still a massive preoccupation with creating the reality and atmosphere to the detriment of a good script. Nate's faltering approach to Ella when she first visited his cabin stood in stark contrast to the violence that was to follow and was another one. I was astounded that an American studio could produce such a European film with it's slow pace and its unfocused plot.,1
I'ts like going around in a museum.,1
"By the time it opened, "" Heaven's Gate "" had become, to its detriment, more a cultural phenomenon than a motion picture. But by 1980, in the wake of the Reagan Revolution, it was thought of as nearly un - American.",1

I've seen it at least half - a - dozen times and have long thought of it as a masterpiece. The result is an inauthentic sense of period speech. He wanted an epic, for sure. The images lack sharpness and particularity of detail. The film sits uneasily and unconvincingly between styles, and perhaps even genres.",1
"< br / > < br / > Yes, it's a long movie, but so have been many others. I first saw this film when released in 1980.",1
"A recent book, the Worst Movies of All Time, includes Heaven's Gate. 5 % of those voting at IMDB rate this movie a 10, as do I. < br / > < br / > I was stunned and pleased to see that 22. This film is not to be missed but any serious student American filmmaking.",1

"It's a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and / or performed. There's even a few shots from "" Son Of Dracula "". It's funny, it's sad. It's not in general release.",1
This is tragic. This film needs to be available. Harry Nilsson deserves nothing less.,1
"Biodoc on the enigmatic singer / songwriter who, according to friends'accounts, spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life seemingly on a mission of self - destruction. We learn of his close ties to John Lennon and, later, Ringo Starr ( Lennon often said that Nilsson was his favorite American musician ). Best set of heads I can recall in a biodoc. Equally informative and moving are interview segments with Nilsson's wives Annie and Una, his son Zach, and cousin Doug Hoefer.",1

This movie was better than I expected.,1

Sondheim does for barber shops what Hitchcock did for showers!,1
"She must have had so much fun with this role. I felt like I wanted to see something more faithful before I see the Burton one and give it a chance just as a movie.

"Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex portrayal, as Mrs. Lovett. with current opera superstar Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. Others have commented on the operatic quality of the score.",1
"I can't get over the quality of the score, the book, and the performances. < br / > < br / > Then - - the lyrics. Angela Lansbury totally surprised me. It's like a Bach chorale in that sense - - just a masterpiece of composition. The rhymes are so clever. Sondheim deserves a literary award for his poetry alone. Why haven't I heard of him before?",1

"Even if you're not a "" theatre person, "" I highly recommend that you see this. The ending will give you chills. Top marks for a wonderful show.",1
This one however changed my mind. Pick up if you can. All in all a great video. Lansbury is also very good and very funny. I have only praise for this film.,1
"She just doesn't sing that song well at all. George Hearn is absolutely brilliant. He has a wonderful voice, yet he can throw his voice so well! Everyone is perfect!",1
Lansbury and Hearn command the show as only two great actor / stars can do. This is exciting theatre flawlessly transferred to the small screen.,1
"00 degree saying I was an ( Hon ) DDiv. A pure cup without a handler....... ( see the movie ). Ideas out of the roof she is under would be the developing on her sidewalk life. Run the world "" or don't get your own home was the college offer. There is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school. A heart not yet connected to her head - something that age has never had a genuine answer to even to this day. Who was freeing anyone for",1
Her comprehensive delivery of a simplistic character held movie together.,1
"? However, this film touched my heart. Would he, like James, try again??",1
"But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold. So while it isn't a perfect movie, it's certainly an enjoyable one. Evie also has a secret.",1
"< br / > < br / > And in a small role, Fred Savage is fun to watch. < br / > < br / > The men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles. The acting was very good by everyone involved.",1
"What maybe worked well as a stage - play didn't hold out quite so well on screen. I especially enjoyed the way the role of Emily, a mentally challenged savant, was handled. I very much enjoyed this movie and I think most fans of Lauren Ambrose will too.",1
"My vote is eight. < br / > < br / > "" Admissions "" is a very powerful drama about needy of love and guilty complex. But when Martha becomes aware, she finds the reality of Evie, triggering a series of revelations.",1
The other weakness is the ending. His part is underdeveloped.,1
If you happen to come across this film - check it out!,1
"If Voltaire were writing "" Candide "" today, the character would be self - help writer. The action is punctuated by several musical numbers.",1
"It is almost like an operetta. Had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called "" Half Empty. "" It is silly, funny, entertaining and amusing.",1
< br / > < br / > well done!,1
( 1982 ) was a funny show that ended too soon. Police Squad!,1
"For anyone who has ever sought happiness, "" Half Empty "" is a must - see. While explaining their decision to Bob, the boardroom erupts into a rousing song which would make Monty Python proud. From his arrival in Hamburg, Bob's complete ignorance of the German language leaves him at a distinct disadvantage.",1
"Great cast, great movie.",1
I would love to see this movie again.,1
! This film is genius!,1
And never worked in one for sure.,1
She is bonus in this movie.,1
"To my dismay, it never is. I watched it with my parents, a brother and a few friends. I'd buy it in a second if they ever release it to DVD. Although I loved The Party, I feel this one is funnier.",1
"Often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of film Sellers was best known for ; satirical farce.",1
"The funniest show ever on TV, albeit the humor is not for everyone. I realize it would have been hard to keep the show fresh if it had ran longer, but it's a shame only six episodes were filmed. The boxer responds, "" I can take him blindfolded! """,1
"With so many scene stealers on display, Sellers comes through with what may perhaps be his most hilarious role. That man was at least 85! ).",1
"Behind Closed Door is well worth seeing. There's a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee. However, the Mary Astor character is interesting, appealing and believable.",1
Not a truly great movie - - too predictable - - but certainly better than advertised.,1
"< br / > < br / > Worth look. Kitty Kelly is good as the sidekick, Dolores. ), and Cortez is good but doesn't have much to do.",1
Lifted way above the average by Mrs. Astor's intelligent performance.,1
"2 ) is too low. No, certainly not. Is this a good movie?",1
"The production and sets, also, were much better than I expected.",1
"Darn, well I guess I will get ridiculed and spat upon here, but for me this was a pretty good flick when I saw it. Some good action here and there, and some blood and violence as well. I think that is basically all there is to it, throw in a few scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie.",1
Two years after'Airplane! were killed off in opening credits.,1
Bravo David Tennant. With it having a great build up to the final.,1
Keep it up!,1
< br / > < br / > My Grade : +,1
"RotC had some positive elements, the most important being Tennant's excellent portrayal of the Doctor. Age of Steel follows up the previous episode, Rise of the Cybermen, which was excellent in some respects, lacking in others. This aside, these two episodes were passable, but weak.",1
"Let's hope so. In short, just what the doctor ordered ( pun intended ). """,1
"This regeneration even says sorry to a cyberman during the battle! His journey from zero to hero is complete, and it has been an utterly convincing one. Coming from a die hard Whovian you can get no better recommendation than that.",1
"- Ajun There is much religious matter as well, as the grandfather refers to Jonathan as "" The Jew. "" This results in a rigid search across the country, and they are determined to find what they are looking for. I give this wonderful, if not illuminated movie, a 10 out of 10.",1
She doesn't have to.,1
"It's also about Alex, his tour guide through the Ukraine, and Alex's grandfather. So would labeling it as a comedy or a travel film, although it's about a journey and is as exceptionally funny as it is moving.",1
"Right! Somewhere, on BetaMax no less, I have all six episodes. "", how can THAT be comedy!?!? Even the deep backgrounds always have gag ongoing. How stupid was ABC?",1
"Haha - sad really. It's a very good experience. The movie itself is great - the soundtrack, the performances, the cinematography - it all works. I didn't even know it was in theatres. I didn't know when the DVD came out.",1
"And throughout film. The film does however leave you on a satisfied note - yet to the weak - hearted souls, a tear may be dropped. Personally, I have never read the novel. And also, the cast is introduced perfectly. For Elijah Wood's character, Jonathon, his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmother's hand.",1
i loved the range. there is a lot in this film.,1
"Jonathan Safran Foer is played with candor by Elijah Wood. The cinematography is spectacular. It is a film worth the time and emotional investment. They also call him the "" seeing eye bitch "". He is in search of his paternal heritage in the Ukraine.",1
"Hutz makes an impressive debut as the loose - limbed, easygoing Alex. More than one family secret gets revealed during their quest. Wood's quiet, wide - eyed, earnest manner works very well in this role. The movie, wisely, attempts less.",1
< br / > < br / > Just enjoy : ),1
"It really gets one thinking. < br / > < br / > It is magnificent, and in my opinion, one of Elijah Wood's best movies. Yet, this story is so philosophical ; it goes deeper than that. That conversation about the ring and "" in case. """,1
"Etc. I saw this last night and voted it an "" 8 "". Both feelings, of course, are valid. < br / > < br / > The acting was good ( Hultz in the role of Alex, the interpreter, was especially great ).",1
It'high time. < br / > < br / > It was certainly time for this to be chronicled and I hope that more stories will come out of this. The Nazis were particularly cruel to Russians and Russian Jews.,1
"That's exactly right. "" If you've ever been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely hilarious. I spent most of the movie nodding my head and thinking, "" Yep.",1
"Formally a resident good in Lord He is on a mission to find a woman in a photograph. < br / > < br / > Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, an inquisitive young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes. What ensues is essentially a comedy.",1
"I highly recommend seeing it - - twice. It wasn't confusing, just deep. It simply is - - and is simply - - one of the best films in years. Witness how fiercely he protects her. Besides, it's more fun to tease these out yourself.",1
"In America, the Jewish Jonathan Safran Foer ( Elijah Wood ) collects personal belongings of his family for recollection. My vote is seven. The movie begins like a comedy, with a sarcastic black humor, and ends in a touching and tragic drama recommended for specific audiences.",1
"Everything is Illuminated "" is a magnificent, moving piece of cinema. Yep, that'll be Elijah Wood again. The first part, whilst occasionally a bit funny, is mostly serious and intense. SPOILERS A Jewish Frodo? Still, it isn't like Wood does this alone.",1
"Eugene Hutz ( Young Alex ) and Boris Lesking ( Old Alex ) are both really just wonderful. That to me is very misleading. The review I saw suggested that the humor is Absurdist. See "" Fiddler on the Roof "" for Humor used in both ways in this rich tradition. Instead, I think this movie stands in the tradition of much Jewish / Yiddish literature and theatre.",1
2005 was one of the best year for movies. This is special.,1
"All in all a "" 10 "". < br / > < br / > / Does the academy have a category for animals? What an original piece of work.",1
He and Hutz play off each other well until the conclusion that becomes more sentimental in this streamlined plot. < br / > < br / > Schreiber does a wonderful job visualizing the human urge to document history.,1
"Typical Hollywood. Basically, the show was never given any chance.",1
"Alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light. At times, the film is spoken in Russian and seems like a foreign film. The title itself is a play on self discovery.",1
"Watching makes Jonathan think it shows the grandfather and his girlfriend, taken on happier times. His love for his grandparents is boundless. Watching the photograph, taken a long time ago, a young couple are seen together. He watches as his grandfather dies and as his grandmother is on what appears to be her death bed. The film clearly surpassed our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas. < br / > < br / > Jonathan is a collector.",1
It'perfect.,1
Bring your handkerchiefs! This is a truly remarkable film. < br / > < br / > No spoilers here. I recommend it highly.,1
A book I gather is really good. Can someone say Oscar?,1
"With some brilliant and absolutely touching scenes "" Everything is Illuminated "" managed to capture my heart. The acting is incredibly powerful, the story mysterious and interesting, and the artistic appeal of the cinematography, to die for. I walked out with a joy I have barely come to feel with American films.",1
But the space for his grandfather is conspicuously bare. Schreiber also wrote the screenplay.,1
"It'definitely worth the watch! The storyline may be true to life, however the subplot is dead - on.",1
Movie wraps up very nicely. to Japan as his career winds down.,1
"< br / > < br / > "" Mr. That alone would make it the better movie.",1
Ken Takakura Oda as a tough yet Honorable Manager makes sense. SupportMDb.,1
"His ugliness was purely facial, merely skin - deep ; his personality and his humanity were deep and genuine. I believe that the Ugly Americans still far outnumber the Mr Baseballs ; they are still our last, best hope. The original Ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the eponymous 1958 novel by Burdick and Lederer, and the exact opposite of Mr Baseball. I couldn't add a thing to the excellent reviewing job that IMDb members have already done.",1
""", but always there seems to be some higher purpose involved. You'll want to watch this film more than once, and each time, Mr. Baseball hits home run.",1
I am an Australian currently living in Japan.,1
Which is too bad because I think it's pretty good. Not too many people seem to know about this movie. There isn't too much to complain about.,1
"He must adjust to life in Japan ( "" First you wash, THEN you bathe! "" Baseball will not let you down!",1
"This is an excellent, little known movie.",1
It only lists this movie. This has always been a favorite movie of mine.,1
< br / > < br / > Baseball and the romance is subordinate to this critique of the two cultures. Many believe this movie is a baseball movie. This movie is not a romantic comedy. < br / > < br / > This movie is about culture.,1
"When watching these movies, notice how manychticks are taken from the TV show. The format was definitely polished to introduce Naked Gun. To say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all. Writing is superb.",1
"She is a proper and supportive girlfriend for Jack. Redo the Oscars from 1992, and this film might get nominated, or even win. The Giants are admired for their success, yet that success also has everyone wanting to surpass them, something which is rarely done. If you wanted to know what living here or there was like back then, this film will show you.",1
"I swear I felt the same as Jack,. Too bad they don't make a sequel. When I met my girlfriends dad, at his home in Kanagawa.",1
"8 + out 10! I lived on Okinawa for over 2 years, and northern Honshu for 4.",1
BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes. MR. Not really.,1
"It's really about living in Japan, and it really succeeds. A lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie, but I feel this is only secondary.",1
( SPOILERS?? ) Another kick ass movie.,1
Unlike Ninja Scroll this movie hit a much more serious note and i think that's where it hit me. I think the story is perfect.,1
"It was up to the viewer to get the jokes. Who could forget ""... the part of town known as "" Little Italy ""... "" with the coliseum in the background. He went on to explain why there were only 6 shows.",1
"What is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews I have read here, is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film. The abandonment of Courtenay at the end by Sir has been anticipated all the way through, if this subtext is included : it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his Dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to.",1
they are pretty freaky. one thing that really looks good in this movie are the monsters.,1
"A little creepy but that goes with territory. They do, and throw him down a well. Some of what ensues is up to our imagination. I'd recommend this. Its sexual at times, but not like "" In The Realm Of The Senses "".",1
"They're soon sleeping together, but after he does something to her ( let's just say a "" shave "" ), he knows that he'll find out, and immediately proposes that they kill Gisaburo. They drink him up, strangle him, and then toss him down a well. She does, reluctantly, and he pushes her around on a road she doesn't know, in the wee hours before dawn, surrounded by smoke.",1
"But their failure of nerve and his returning ghost condemn them to madness. Its beautifully handled, with imaginative set scenes, and the lovers passion is portrayed beautifully.",1
"My vote is eight. < br / > < br / > "" Ai no Borei "" is a surreal and supernatural love story.",1
"This is indeed solid good movie. But they never enjoy that freedom since Remorse begins to haunt them beginning as usual at the time by the weakest member of the couple, the woman of course. Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death command the dialectics of Life.",1
I found this movie very funny.,1
Some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf. Another treat is the perfect faux - NYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition.,1
"In fact, I think this movie was perfectly cast.",1
I liked the plot and the idea of the movie and I especially liked the cast. Nice going troops. Who wouldn't?,1
"Definite "" DBF "" by the way = that means diesel boats forever. < br / > < br / > Line 10.",1
That's how this movie is with me.,1
< br / > < br / > Hilarity ensues.,1
I really enjoyed this movie. Pure Navy!,1
"The first few minutes of this movie don't do it justice! Kelsey Grammar with his "" God I LOVE this job! "" was sincere, genuine and lovable. I am still amazed at the size of that fishing boat next to a sub! Rob Schneider is hysterical as the crew gets back at him for being annoying. For me, its not funny until they board the sub and those hilarious characters begin to gel.",1
The movie can also be very serious at times.,1
Rip Torn and Bruce Dern.,1
But then again very few flicks are.,1
This movie is more about lines than plot.,1
He's up against the Navy's best - a Los Angeles Class nuclear attack sub - and his old captain ( Wm Macy ). < br / > < br / > I don't think it takes a clairvoyant to know who will win in this exercise! 50.,1
"This a parrot.... from the Caribbean. "" This is a VERY underrated movie to say the least. Uhhh... no. It was indeed due to a rare mix of actors in sync.",1
"Since then, we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now.",1
SURPRISE! When you're sure you know the ending.... Great movie!,1
"His crew isn't any better, misfits of the U. S. Navy. I loved when they were in silence and Buckman farts, and everyones reaction to the smell is hilarious. Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this movie.",1
"This can expired in 1966! So it was a diesel engine sub, so what? Absolutely beautiful, a piece of art come alive. I love military comedies ( Sgt.",1
"My score : 7 / 10. However, Cover Girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend. The supporting characters were also competent acted.",1
"And this was 6 - 7 years before 9 / 11. Maverick means "" non - conformist "".",1
What the film does is get the job done right way and I liked it.,1
"It's still very funny to me. I'm not that person though. They give him a diesel sub, an ancient relic from World War II. Would they make it? < br / > < br / > But Dodge is at the end of the line.",1
Not an original or terribly well written screenplay.,1
I'm glad they finally released it on DVD.,1
This is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on.,1
"This is a feel good movie as good as they come. I've enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in the theatre. The tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout. In fact, the lack of pretension is what makes it so much fun to watch. This is entertainment. I'm grateful to have my own copy.",1
It is such a deep film and very moving. It really does grip you.,1
"Money is hidden in boxes and shoes. The way the camera was used made it very intimate. I just watched the DVD of this award winning film. < br / The mother ( very well acted by Maureen Carr ) is uptight and drawn in on herself. But this, and other things offer moments of hope.",1
The director is certainly one watch.,1
"Much leg candy for the male audience is a nice bonus! < br / > < br / > But Rita drives this whole movie. To Ms. Hayworth's credit, also drives'Gilda ', and Gilda drives any red - blooded male insane. < br / > < br / > This may be the best showcase for the multi - talented Ms. Hayworth. The comedy may be dated, but it is still quite amusing. < br / > < br / > The film holds up well after all these years.",1
"No car chases, but a film packed with hum our and emotion. Mean, gripping, moody and captivating. Don't take my word for it see it yourself. Every home should have a copy!",1
< br / > < br / > Overall this film IS a must see. It could be set in any town in the UK. I was very moved by a few scenes. A truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life.,1
"8 for her amazing achievement. The performances are strong, particularly Maureen Carr as the mother, Trise.",1
"Or is this future of wonderful, affordable film making? ? Is that not what films are supposed to be about!",1
"Its IMDB rating of 1. Overall, though, it is a fine piece of work.",1
"But the ending theme song was a plus. but it is basically the same as the first movie. and how other people from other land across the ocean fight. I totally recommend it. With new jutsus and garra in the movie, u know it is good.",1
"All the characters you want are here! Naruto, Sakura, Gaara, Kankuro and Shikamaru! And it does! And maybe they could have a PASSIONATE KISS! 5 / 5!",1
"It then shits to Naruto, Sakura, and Shikumaru hunting down a ferret for what they think is going to be an easy assignment. My favorite was the one involving Garaa fighting this strange woman who takes him very lightly which is a very big mistake. Of course, all is not as it seems and there are plenty of fights to go around. I liked this movie, the second Naruto feature film. The story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants.",1
"I think that's where this movie fails. < br / > < br / > The story was fun. The music mostly reminded me of a lot of pieces used in old SNES games. Naruto Movie 2, however, takes all of these aspects and excels upon them.",1
"Otto Kruger, Eve Arden, and Edward Brophy give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles. The amusing Phil Silvers nearly steals the film as Kelly's partner. Just watch Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her. < br / > < br / > All in all, this is delightful film that's worth watching even if you're not big on musicals.",1
"It is said that he had some input on his scenes as well. What is special about this film, though, is recreating silent movies in 1939. Lots of DVD extras as well in this restored version released in 2008. The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch. As most film viewers today And, oh yes, there's romance, and a little sadness too. The producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. Sennett had the pie throwings, the bathing beauties and Keystone Cops. And Molly, of course is Mabel.",1
"However, "" Hollywood Cavalcade "" is still quite watchable. He becomes extremely successful with her as his star. He's so shocked, he dumps her. A few scenes later, Rin - Tin - Tin is shown to be # 1 box office. Fortune smiled on him even at the end.",1
"He'll be okay as long as he still has his friends. Upon returning, the film takes a dramatic turn. Several over - budget flops later, he is known as nothing more than the director who turned down Rin - tin - tin. After inventing pie throwing and the keystone cops, his dream comes true. It's 1913. Fortunately for him, the loyal and compassionate residents of Hollywood are untainted by ambition and ego.",1
"In the last charge, they killed Roman Nose, one of the more famous Indian Chiefs. I have noticed on the print shown on local TV that one scene has reversed film. I have always liked it.",1
"Oh, for those polaroid lenses again.",1
"For all the film's polis and presentation, the movie was made in just three days.",1
"The actors are the best reason to see "" Black Day, Blue Night. """,1
"But do! I expected nothing from this movie, just something to pass the time, but I was hooked from the start! It looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film!",1
So go over to their house pop some popcorn and enjoy! It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was.,1
"Black Day Blue Night was actually good modern noir. And together, while driving in the pouring rain, they meet a third, very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets.",1
Blondell was edible.,1
"< br / > < br / > Handsome Lyle Talbot plays Joan's persistent suitor, but he's given relatively little to do. Whether awakening to find himself in the wrong bed or being chased across the roof of a Cuban hacienda in his long johns, he is equally hilarious. He was only 35 years old. Chubby, cherubic Guy Kibbee appears as the girls'intended target. Although Joan gets both top billing and the romantic scenes, both gals are as talented & watchable as they are gorgeous.",1
The beach scenery is very tranqui... until along comes Robbie Coltrane...!,1
"You won't forget it! And so begins this witty movie, full of slick comedy and crude jokes. He makes a deal with Dennis, that if he helps him catch the drug smugglers, then he will be set free and allowed whatever he pleases. Then comes along Commander Robertson ( Ronald Allen ), Chief Intelligence, Scotland Yard. Dennis agrees, and is teamed up with Harvey Duncan ( Peter Richardson ), and Lesley Reynolds ( Jennifer Saunders ).",1
So come on IMDb. 33 : 1 ( full screen ) format. Could you find out for us?,1
And love it I do. ! So I'll keep looking at car boot sales for the original version. P!! This film is great!,1
"< br / > < br / > I've probably watched Supergrass 20 or 30 times, and I still can't decide 100 %. And very funny with it.",1
). This film makes several nods to various science fiction films.,1
I taped this on Sundance and had no idea that it was a Miike film. < br / > < br / > So far he hasn't disappointed me yet. I thought it was just another kung fu movie.,1
"Rita is lovely, and even plays a dual role as Rusty and Rusty's grandmother. There are no surprises, but everybody does their thing well. Highly recommended. Clearly, this film meant a lot to him. This was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable.",1
"This is a film that has to be taken in context. It's a great finish to the series. You could criticise it for being a bit cheesy, but isn't that part of the charm?",1
"but thats where the similarities ends. The rebels aided by mercenaries and a cyborg, try to brake his suffocating hold on his subjects.",1
"Meanwhile, we get the conventional sides to Ryo and Takeshi'stories, and they're never uninteresting, just not totally convincing enough to hold interest. Of Then a cop, Takeshi ( Takeiuchi ) happens to be the mayor's top guard. And it all leads up to one last, inexplicable showdown between the two men.",1
"I love those kind of movies. So, without further to do. Even the drama wasn't that good.",1
"pitched against each other for one last battle, this time in the future. The plot owes a lot to Blade Runner, but done in Takashi Miike's low budget, frenetic, comic style.",1
"Takashi Miike has always mined the sexual motifs beneath male violence in action films, and this film with the exception of "" Gozu "", reinforces this theme more than any other. Part of me felt cheated, part of me confused, but mostly I was just laughing. A lot of the film is quite boring though, the best scenes bookend film while the rest is far too slow.",1
"< br / > < br / > Not as deep or well developed as DOA2, not as outrageous and intense as DOA1... still another good Miike movie though. Miike's explanation of the connection is very funny though, and caps series off quite nicely. It's quite a slow, thoughtful film that meanders along and doesn't try to force anything down the viewer's throat. There's also a HK stunt crew on hand for the films action sequences, which are very cool in a HK - via - Miike style.",1
Everything up to then is even less unequivoc.,1
< br / > < br / > The men in the story are also well cast. Ann Harding is the free - spirited wife longing for'wisteria & tranquillity'far from foggy London.,1
He like this film a lot.,1
"One dance performance by Gene Kelly stands out. Of course there is the music and the dancing. Don't miss this one, great entertainment.",1
"Overall, a solid and enjoyable Scooby Doo film.",1
"Enjoy "" Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster ""!",1
good job. that's how i would describe this animated Scooby - Doo adventure. i liked the story.,1
There are plenty of laughs. Fact : We DON'T sound like that. Where are the Hex Girls when you need ' And the plot a lot better than Monster of Mexico. However if you can immune yourself to it you'll be alright. Loch Ness Monster is a considerable improvement. Looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands. < br / > < br / > The only bad thing this time around is the music.,1
"the movie is not without its soft moments either, which gives it a nice sense of balance. it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end. cool flick. hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon. i think the supporting actress did a great job in her role.",1
I was very entertained by this film. ? The footage was shot really well. I am a Talent Manager. I love a movie with a few twists. The Mobsters all look real???,1
"Great movie and I didn't even drink a beer. 00 dollars. ) ( I read the VENT MAGAZINE interview and Carpenter has never made movie for more than $ 400, 000. Where has this guy been! ( Doug Brown's Music Score was sensational. )",1
He gives his work 200 %. I loved the cast. The film has great texture.,1
"I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, especially "" Uncle Benny "". From start to finish, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1
"My friend, who works at Magno Sound, told us that this movie was shot on Super 16. He was amazing. The photography was so good, it looked as though it was a 35mm shoot.",1
The old adage applies here - that happiness and fame always don't mix. What dancing and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly.,1
The ending took a wonderful twist. I would recommend you seeing it. It was entertainment. I found the Movie very interesting.,1
He's gotta be my Tony Gangi someday...,1
I found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. The supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters. Great job!,1
"Fred Carpenters best work to date! I loved this film, Independent film - making at its best. And that is just what they did! Being a photographer, I was most impressed with the cinematography. You will love it.",1
"Becasur I said so. Why? His girl was wrong. He's so fine. Peace, Happy New Year!",1
The highlight for me was the performance of Paul Vario. role.,1
< br / > < br / > Kudos to Fred Carpenter who has truly pulled out a winner with this one!,1
"Great script. Topnotch acting by some talented Long Islanders. Great job to all who participated in this film. You will enjoy this film, go see!",1
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > Great new faces, great new music, and great new story - what more could you ask for. This film is highly recommended!",1
I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively.,1
I would like to just say that for Minh Nguyen to make the statement that America brought the war to Vietnam is one sided. ). It doesn't focus on the American involvement solely. As far as the mini series ; why do I love it?,1
"I suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie. "" It has a wonderful plot and moral that tells a wonderful story. I defntly gove this movie a 10 out of 10.",1
He would give the role the depth it requires. Its too Pat Marita is no longer. Instead they put in a girl! This is the Karate Kid for you! HAHAHAHAHAHA funny huh? I was thinking perhaps Dennis Franz. Jiminey Christmas! Don't waste your time with 1 - 3. Meanwhile where is Ralphy?? I felt he never did service to the role of the Karate Kid. She won a freakin Oscar.,1
It is a great family movie. That is exactly what happens this one. I wish the series had not ended so soon. Miyagi was great as in the previous 3!!,1
2 thumbs up!,1
< br / > < br / > I love that song! < br / > < br / > Thank you.,1
"She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway, whose owner proposes her. My vote is nine. The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine. Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent : I found her amazing in'Gilda ', but she is stunning in'Cover Girl '.",1
He offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.,1
"My rating : 8 / 10 However, in more ways than one, it's a guilty pleasure. Also, one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks. It almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie. < br / > < br / > So maybe this isn't a perfect movie. So maybe this wouldn't be the greatest movie to rent on Friday night. You can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her. OK, so this is a complete rip off of the first Karate Kid. I also have a suspicion about Martial Arts movies that end on prom night.",1
"To me, Ned ( Michael Cavalieri ) was a real bully.",1
Both Daniel and Julie favored karate. That was very funny! And there was no tournament to compete in. The set in Boston was a far cry from California.,1
She also hones her karate skills.,1
Macchio could've been the love interest for Julie in this film! Never mind! We can all learn a thing or two from Myiagi's witticisms!,1
8 / 10 Naturally she is trained how to fight. the ending is also good and a bit surprising. this is the 4th movie in the Karate Kid series. none of the fighting is graphic.,1
"Thank you Zamfi! I mean, come on! We miss you Noriyuki!",1
"He should have supported his girlfriend! Cover Girl is a glorious, fluffy film - perfect escapism. Great movie, truly impressed. She has such a scene presence and is a very good actress. One thing I didn't like was Gene Kelly's character.",1
"All in all, I enjoyed it. The Zen monks add some humor and lightness to the narrative flow. The plot twists are believable and predictable. The Zen monastery is both austere and charming.",1
"Growing up as of child of the movies, one of the trilogies I shall not soon forget is that of the Karate Kid.",1
I have a vivid memory of a different ending. But nothing like this showed up in movie. WTF?,1
But for reasons of her own deep insecurity she keeps them at arms length. It later turns out that young man is not the lonely and homeless person that Frances thought that he is. Actress Sandy Dennis is perfect as the Dr. Jekyll and Miss.,1
"She is far better here than she was in "" The Out of Towners "".",1
This film requires a lot of patience. You may have to buy it off the internet. < br / > < br / > I praise Robert Altman. But the film builds to a disturbing climax.,1
"Well, it is totally unique. You won't forget it soon. If you can find this film watch it.",1
"If you see film again, it will be evident how wily the Altman mind works...",1
"com peterkurth. Second, compare the pictures of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Anyone can see that they are one - and - the - same person.",1
"In "" Anasasia "", I never felt for one moment that "" it's only a film "". Despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released, I sometimes still think she was. Then I bought the video and can totally recommend it. """,1
"As far as her dancing, I think she was excellent. You'll have to watch the film to find out!",1
It's out of question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia. Life must have been hard for a young Polish peasant worker in those days. < br / > < br / > Anna Anderson was an awesome woman on a wrong track. Fictionalised a bit but still remains faithful to the reality. < br / > < br / > On the whole this is a great show. Highly recommended.,1
"But sticks to the real story quite well. It keeps up historically pretty much, names are changed etc.",1
One well - known professional instructor commented that nothing else in cinema comes close for dance excitement. This movie is a very enjoyable homage to the Bogart and other detective films of old. Guy's ensemble is the live band that the dancers perform to in the scene.,1
I loved it! No one can be perfect Bogart but he was great.,1
Throw in cameos by Mike Mazurk,1
"It consisted with a new "" in croud "", Merciurios.",1
"In other words, it was everything it set out to be. I mean, it is a children's cartoon.",1
"charlie's performance is magnificent. gotta love diney, for all moral failures!",1
"It's hard not to love her in anything. It also helps that the screenplay is great. His dancing, however, wow. A fantastic musical starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. Her smile is so disarming. Her dancing is wonderful, as is the rest of her acting.",1
They also make great travel films for seeing western states. A lumberman finds a young cougar in need of help.,1
It'very memorable in more ways than one. It came on the Disney Channel in the wee hours of the morning.,1
Who can forget Picker and his gramophone or Chet being ambushed? It is a classic. This is the Australian TV series. This is cult TV. The music and song just fantastic. The stories and actors are excellent.,1
To add modern political vernacular. Then the realism of the hard out back was fantastic. It was sadly missed. Hard living and hard working.,1
! Come on ABC... release The Outsiders on DVD!!!!,1
"And is the music ( Title Theme ) available on CD? I would like to know if "" The Outsiders "" ( Australian TV series ) will ever be released on DVD sometime in the future?",1
This movie was well done. The biggest problem was coming home to learn that many Americans were opposed to the war. < br / > < br / > Most decent men will come home from war with guilt and emotional scars. They need acceptance and understanding to overcome that. I was in Vietnam and only once heard of such an act by one who witnessed it. The offender was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in Leavenworth. Not the manner in which they served.,1
"Also starring Corin Nemec and Carla Gugino. There have been many movies about people returning home from wars and having to cope, but "" The War at Home "" is worth seeing. But after dinner, there can be no neutrality.",1
"The acting is absolutely superb. I actually ran across this movie by accident. So I sat and watched it and boy was I blown away. I was taping another movie on Showtime one night, overnight and this movie came on afterward. I feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie.",1
They supplied a score that is full of charm and characterization. Hayworth fans will want to see Rita in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability. This has got to be one of the better post - Astaire musicals made by Columbia.,1
The atmosphere in the movie is very tense and sad. < br / > < br >,1
Wow! So why have I never heard of this movie before?,1
And the family does not know how to handle the problem. This is a little - seen anti - war film that has been ignored for too long. Estevez does a magnificent job with material. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the entire movie. High recommended A truly moving film. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas. But the kind of war that takes place in this home is as intense as any real battlefield action. The time is Thanksgiving of 1972.,1
"Brilliant acting by Estevez, Sheen and Kathy Bates.",1
"She and her son, who just recently returned from Vietnam collide in some very tense issues. This is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads one to despair.",1
It has to be seen to be appreciated. The setting is Thanksgiving Day and the relatives are coming for dinner.,1
Kathy Bates reminded me of my mother in a way. This movie is powerful.,1
"An under - appreciated, unseen gem. You can sense the pain and frustration bubbling beneath surface. And to any Vietnam war buff.",1
The sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and effectively added to the tension. < br / > < br / > The visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth. The acting here is TOP NOTCH!,1
"When they find one, all three of them will have good luck, they believe. Danny wants her to have her success, but at the same time realizes he's lost her. Phil Silvers is very amiable and funny as the in - house comic and best friend. They all hate oysters, but they're looking for a pearl. She is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life. Why couldn't she have had < br / > < br / > This is a very good movie with no dull spots.",1
I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I had not heard of it before. < br / > < br / > But those are minor complaints. I rate it 8 out of difficult 10. < br / > < br / > This film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who lived these experiences.,1

All of the others I'd seen had dealt strictly with the front - line of battle. < br / > < br / > The pacing of the movie is done extremely well. I am hard - pressed to think of a point where it drags. Definitely worth seeing.,1
"I want the DVD! < br / > < br / > 10 / 10, and definitely in my top 10.",1
"Kathy Bates is the overbearing mom, and does a great job. < br / > < br / > The film is realistic, as we see Emilio home from Vietnam, during Thanksgiving. The real surprise is Emilio Estevez, who has not always been in the greatest films, but also directed this movie. But it was not ; it was so much more!.",1
< br / > < br / > Damned if it didn't pull me in. Estevez is a good actor but lousy as a director.,1
"The connection with James Dean? So he saved his "" honor "" by forcing his son to do his duty.",1
I know that the actors are already there.,1
I was just lucky I found this movie.,1
The shocking end is a stunner! A much overlooked film that should be seen. must see film.,1
"This is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. Meanwhile Danny, Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls at their local diner. Don't be shy and demure - chatter and sparkle "". In the meantime Rusty has been chosen Cover Girl and Danny McGuires'is the place to be seen. Rusty does so with gusto!!!",1
"Talent REALLY does run in that family. Of course, it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors. The ending made me cry, without resorting to standard Hollywood medrama. This is not meant to be an action movie ; this is a character study. Hopefully, one day Martin and Emilio will unite with Charlie, and they will all make a great film together. I caught this movie on TV yesterday. She tugged at my heartstrings with every word of dialogue.",1
"< br / > < br / > The only fault I had with this was its realism. It showed how a very violent, reactive authority might react to resistance. It was a very strong, deeply moving film. And that'coming from an Anarchist.",1
Brilliant... Quite brilliant.,1
"Totally impressing. I saw it a short while ago. It is even to buy on DVD, with additional stuff. Death Camp Opera : Right Here, Right Now! Punishment Park is for those who want to grow. I found a masterpiece. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both actually. There is enough on the net to know many things about the movie.",1
I watched pp the other night. What if that had happened?,1
It shows how much violence you can find in our world.,1
"Peter Watkins'rarely seen Punishment Park is a brutality - laced, uncompromised political weapon set across a never ending desertscape. At least it appears to have that history to it now, maybe not as much when it was ( barely ) released.",1
It looks very real and that is what it aims for.,1
"Another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great. It confirmed Gene Kelly's amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. 'Poor Tom'is a huge downer. But that's only my opinion. Such artistry. It stinks.",1
"First of all, the entire script is mostly improv, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are watching is an actual documentary. Cut! "" Secondly, the actors hired by Watkins were purposefully chosen to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds.",1
"Watkins also claims that the actors are often expressing their own opinions which certainly explain the ferocity as well as the believability of their performances. In such cases the government is authorised to apprehend and detain anyone they believe may engage in future activities of sabotage. The group on trial includes a feminist, a black panther and a folk singer. Many of the actors are amateurs improvising with broad characters. It has been claimed that the film is reactionary and unequivoc They must accomplish this without food or water.",1
"And succeeds. It kicks you in the stomach. You won't feel happy. Then again, why shouldn't art allow itself to become engaged?",1
"Not surprisingly, the Punishment Park option is a dirty lie. Today, this film still retains its power.",1
"Overall, film gives much to think about and leaves an indelible taste..... 8 / 10 DVD rental I saw Peter Watkin's Culloden and The War Game a few months before this and was very impressed. And that's merely the most obvious example.",1
Realistic Master - Piece.,1
"At times I find myself believing that the USA could easily slip into fascism. Certain aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect, specifically some of the acting. I can feel what they must have felt. I grew up hating hippies and in some respects I still do. This movie is a raw, concentrated distillation of America's PRESENT political scene. However I feel that this is probably the most important movie of the "" war on terror "" era.",1
"Warning : it might make you angry. out of 10. The idea is, that if you make it to the flag, you're set free. Not a very upbeat film but definitely worth seeing.",1
"Contains Spoilers < br / > < br / > This is a Peter Watkins film. Watkin's scarce off commentary gives us raw background information ( time, temperature etc. The defense lawyer ( who does take his job seriously ) has to take abuse from both sides. ).",1
This is one of Peter Watkins most < br / > < br / > accessible films. Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. You wont regret it!,1
"Great Musical and a film you will not want to miss, this is truly great Classic Film. Enjoy",1
"If it would be filmed anyway. All the facts are explained, the interviewers ask questions and film everything. They are no heroes. Since there is no information on IMDb I must rely on my other sources and believe it. It seems very, very real. The defendants are people from all social classes. Is this true? In an'utopian'state like this, there surely wouldn't be a european film crew allowed to film those things. One says he's not afraid to die.",1
"The acting is totally convincing. PUNISHMENT PARK is possibly the most important film ever made. It really makes you think. Had it been more widely seen, would it have changed anything? To think this film was made the year I was born.",1
"It reminded me of a sort of realistic version of Battle Royale ( 2000 ). Peter Watkins has excelled himself in his audacity and technical skills. The situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations, however. Maybe that says enough about the truth of its content, about the way power structures in this world function.",1
"The cast has first - rate material to work with in Watkins'screenplay. The sense of realism is enhanced by disarmingly unpretentious, economical, believable portrayals by the entire cast. < br / > < br / > Now consider Punishment Park. Today we tend to take celebrity endorsements for granted, giving little thought to its more alarming implications.",1
"There is only one successor each generation. Hokuto - Big Dipper, Nanto - Gemini. Other characters that join Ken are two kids Rin and Batto who don't do much. Which is funny and badass, but makes for quick fights. The series is also divided into four parts. Each art has their own constellation. Both of them and Toki die along the way.",1
"Romance is in the air, love lurking everywhere. You get to appreciate the talented Kate Capshaw.",1
This movie was sweet.,1
( What is it about that Spielberg!? ) < br / > < br / > The cast is nice.,1
"Just as I pictured them. But, I liked it.",1
I thought the movie was pretty good.,1
Kelly especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the'Alter - Ego'dance.,1
"It is to catch a glimpse of this that his audiences fervently hope for. "" There is an air of desperation about both these men. Sitting at the mirror, his eyes reflect the King's madness. The same goes for Mr T. Courtenay.",1
"Plus, it had Ellen in it and I've always had a soft spot for her.",1
It was very fun to watch!,1
So well done. Tom Selleck does his usual good job.,1
"I thoroughly enjoyed myself and must admit that I thought that this film was one of the most overlooked gems of last year. As a grad student I consider myself to be quite cynical, but this was a beautiful little film that deserves much better than got. In the end I found it to be an interesting meditation on relationships and family. The trailers I saw were not appealing, the cast did not look that interesting and I had no idea what the plot would be about.",1

"The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. By the end of the film, we don't know who the lover or the beloved is but the power of the letter has altered the lives of nearly everyone in the small town. Will she choose the right person?",1
"Will tangled affairs like these ever straighten themselves out? And, on and on the letter goes. The town's museum curator, too, may have a secret love. Throwing caution to the wind, Helen and Johnny begin a small - time "" thing "".",1
"The dances are spectacular. "" The story is great.",1
"However, it's still good and if you get the chance, it's definitely worth seeing. It just misses being both a light romantic comedy and being a clever portrait of life. < br / > < br / > Secondly, the film seems to lose its way in terms of plot in the second half. < br / > < br / > Overall, this film is sweet and good - natured, with some genuinely hilarious moments - for example, Janet explaining condiments to an avid audience.",1
I feel I can feel their feelings. And that difference makes this film eminently enjoyable. The acting part is very strong.,1
"They are a delight to watch. Kate Capshaw is wonderful and I had no previous idea that she would be. I find it refreshing every time I take time to watch it. Frankly, I am surprised that the film is not better known.",1
"You'll see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. First, while he is able to find the gang members, one of the gang member's step - sister is Stanwyck. < br / > < br / > However, there are two serious complications.",1

Another decent offering from the pen of Vince Gilligan. Check it out to see if our Dynamic Duo can hook up at the Pacific and somehow rectify Mr. Crump'big problem.,1
Drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark ending. 8 / 10,1
"Boy. Excellent job by Rob Bowman. If he had been on I - 80, the freeway, maybe. Can we say the word "" effect ""? Silly Scully! It's as dark as a tomb in there! I have no love lost for that man. How are they supposed to see what they're doing in there? All of the filming inside the car looked very authentic.",1
Never a dull moment!,1
A brilliantly dumb episode.,1
Even the outcast kids have their innocent beautiful dreams.,1

"The conditions couldn't be much worse, and are made even more unbearable as two children are killed one after the other by some cause of the guard duty. Some aren't alive some 20 + years later, for all anyone knows. Pixote is directed with barely a shred of sentimentality.",1
"Some other Characters from the movie had a similar fate, some died and others are in jail. so you can have a more in depth idea of the lives of these characters. This is probably the best movie from director Hector Babenco.",1
"Most probably... dead. Where's my cut? """,1
"They, the children of the movie, are desensitized. Only living. Staying alive in a cruel world.",1
"You might remember Jess Barker was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead, Susan Hayward. Kelly later said the Singing here is done by Nan Wynn. It's nicely done in Follies style.",1
All I knew from South America was brochures of fabulous Brazillian vacations and that Columbia had a lot of drug trafficking. < br / > < br / > Then comes film like Pixote. Sad. You're watching : Children.,1
"This film will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person. I thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the middle of all these horrible events... boys are obviously longing not only for their friend, but for a better life. But there is, however, a gentle scene in the middle of the film ; Pixote and his friends are at the beach, missing ( and wishing ) one of his friends from the reformatory was there.",1
< br / > < br / > I recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema.,1
"It's a very brutal movie, but everything is absolutely true, and sad.",1
< br / > < br / > An emotionally devastating movie.,1
I don't think I ever want to see it again - - it was just too much. I'm surprised this got an R rating - - I've seen X rated film that are less graphic. ! A 10. SPOILER END!!!!,1
"When finally he escapes, he and three comrades survive by the only means they know, which is crime.",1
This is no walk in the park. I felt like I'd been severely beaten. You will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie.,1

So as Ale's soul. If you have one.,1
"Trying to stay afloat, Alejandro has to support himself and his older sister.",1
"< br / > < br / > Bora Kizilirmak I strongly suggest it if you like stories of others. Starting on personal level, being the part of environment, being to be ignored when you film.",1
"Maybe there will be a part 2? Back to the movie. At other times, they appeared bored. Definitely worth getting on DVD. City of God and Pixote surely had a much higher budget.",1
"Can't say this wasn't made well. Other than that as an entertainment it works well. I wouldn't encourage anyone to believe that. Both the leads, a brother - sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts.",1
Izzie supplements her income working a food truck by selling herself. Save outrage and do something. They are trying to make money to but their own truck.,1
"< br / > < br / > See this today,.",1
"That is the question this movie essentially poses to the viewer. What you see is what you get, and that is often gritty and at times heartbreaking. Is this a good or bad thing?",1
"He acts as the head of the small family. He begins to steal, first car parts and later wallets. They see the van as their way out, and there is much optimism. It is merely survival. Ale, though young, is tough and mature. Chop Shop, the second feature from Ramin Bahrani, is a rare breed.",1
"Ramin Bahrani sets up a scene early on in Chop Shop that immediately had me identifying with where the character of Ale ( Alejandro Polanco ) and his friend were coming from. It is, subsequently in his hands, thoughtful and heartbreaking, usually at once. Often the people on a subway will see kids like these or minorities selling something or announcing and talking about something on a subway and not pay them any mind.",1
This reminded me what a true small movie can accomplish. Real sound. The people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture which I didn't know about.,1
Chop Shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters!,1
Mostly he is anxious to be reunited with his older sister. < br / > < br / > Ale is one such street kid. Chop Shop. Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani ( Man Push Cart ). How do they cope?,1
Indeed they used their real names in the movie.,1
"A follow up to his acclaimed "" Man Push Cart "", Bahrani spent one and a half years in the location that F. Scott Fitzgerald described as in the Great Gatsby as "" the valley of the ashes "". While he has dreams of owning his own food - service van, in the city that never sleeps, he knows that the only thing that may make the "" top of the heap "" is another dented fender. Shot on location at Willets Point in Queens, Bahrani makes you feel as if you are there, sweating in a hot and humid New York summer with all of its noise and chaos.",1
"This is a great movies, but don't expect any car chase or shooting.",1
"He is also a fine story teller. Where do I begin? It's worth hearing. See this film, and I mean now. < br / > < br / >..... and I MUST mention the music. He can act!",1
Suit Up!,1
Even Justin Timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend.,1
"Not everyone will like it. I happen to like him, a lot. < br / > < br / > This movie is raw, gritty, and at times quite "" in your face "".",1
"The acting done... was it acting? I felt I could trust the movie to flow well, and it did. It reminded me of another movie with Mel Gibson, Tim, where each character had limitations, whether mental or circumstantial, so were well - defined. But, I rented and watched it and was truly amazed. So, with the jacket art aside, I would recommend watching this movie.",1
"But that might just be my naivety. Maybe it's just me though, but I think poor Lazarus should've had his story focused on more. The chain thing was a little too far - fetched for me. The side characters were fairly decent, if simple and I liked the music.",1
"Black Snake Moan is uproarious. < br / > < br / > The acting is, all - around, quite perfect. It is over - flowingly rich, fantastically orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary.",1
"It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. Sometimes the true things in life are not pretty, but they are real. However, I also praise the heart of the movie.",1
"His musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by. The story had heart, and was very influential. then you will be a big fan of this movie. shame.",1
I mean so many elements go into the blues to make it work. < br / > < br / > This was just a good all around story. Redemption.,1
"It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. So they set it in rural south.",1
Sex and love. This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways.,1
3 of them against Norris and his single MS - 07B Gouf custom mobile suit. < br / > < br / > This Gundam series only follows Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory.,1
I was also amazed by Sam's ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing.,1
"The setting is strong, and a case can be made for the literal symbolism ( the chain, the radiator, the strange blurry man who haunts Rae'libido ) being a deliberate outgrowth of superstition and spirituality. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture - - again, this is integrated without subtlety. While heavy - handed, the scene where Lazarus sings Rae a song in the midst of a lightning storm / blackout is compelling, as is a scene inside a jumping blues club that makes you wish you were there.",1
"< br / > < br / > I highly recommend it. I suppose this is what is called Southern Gothic. Timberlake does good work, much to my surprise, I didn't expect it of him.",1
People don't know what it's about. Isn't that the best reason to see a movie? A $ 4 Mil box is a disgrace.,1
From the pumping pounding follow rhythm to where where love is sacred.,1
She's a fox! !,1
Well when this was over I was just left stunned by how great this film truly was. I mean everything was dead - on great and very accurate for that matter. !,1
"Lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain. The next day, Lazarus ( Samuel L. Jackson ) finds Rae and carries her home. The film has a different feel to it. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. The 40 pound chain is a good metaphor, and symbolic of a chastity belt. Rae only wanted to have sex all the time whereas a wife may not. Lazarus has problems of his own, because his wife has just left him for another man.",1
"My vote is eight. Samuel L. Jackson has also a fantastic performance in the role of Lazarus. < br / > < br / > "" Black Snake Moan "" is a weird tale of faith, hope, love and blues.",1
"Something few men in her life have ever done. His wife of 12 years leaves him for his brother, so he spirals into depression. < br / > < br / > Jackson and Ricci do a fantastic job in this film. This is in the subtext and not the main plot of the story. He plays his guitar and sings to her. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. < br / > < br / > Brewer shows us the region he grew up in. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action.",1
Ten out of ten.,1
"If ever a potential movie must've sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper, it would be this one. Scenes that would have come off as laughable and pathetic in lesser artists'hands are, instead, powerful as all get - out.",1
"The acting is astonishing, the writing superb, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, riveting the whole way. Craig Brewer is now officially a writer / director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. Rae's boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and Laz's wife leaves him for his brother. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead - on.",1
"However, there was one weak link in the chain : Justin Timberlake. The accents and the dialogue were carried off flawlessly. I would definitely give him another chance. It was well - edited, well shot, and well - mixed... everything was great. Loved it. < br / > < br / > On the technical side, all was brilliance as far as I could see.",1
"Sadly, third star of the film, Justin Timberlake who plays Rae's military - bound boyfriend isn't all that great. No one is perfect and if everyone would realize that, then we'd be a lot better off. Not exactly looking for what I just described you say? You'd think with the role of a sex - crazed woman, overacting would be a given, but no, not here. < br / > < br / > One thing not up for debate is how great Jackson and Ricci both are here. The question of if this will be understood, or be accepted by all who see the film is another story.",1
"Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. And no.. it's not just a song. If you don't know what the "" Black Snake Moan "" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it.",1
But the film is much more than that.,1
"I hate when "" critics "" miss the point of a film. It may also help that I am the former Director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale... but I get this movie. Now I suppose it helps that I live in Memphis... and have lived in Mississippi a couple of times too.",1
Personally I loved every second of this movie.,1
A good film wasted. Too bad.,1
"Rabbit, Duck ). As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize. On the DVD it has a commentary, featurette, & option to play it music only.",1
Nine out of ten. This wasn't Love Life.,1
Duck! This is hilarious. Why?,1
"Rabbit, Duck! ) Recomded. Still a good cartoon. It simply depends on one gag for too much of the action.",1
"Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda.",1
Can't get better that!,1
I much prefer cartoons with Daffy and Bugs which are fifteen or so years before - hand. The plot is mainly geared by jokes - each joke keeps the episode going. < br / > < br / > 7 and half out of ten.,1
"As intricate an example of Chuck Jones'impeccable timing as you'll come across,'Rabbit Seasoning'is a true classic. It all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration "" You're despicable "". Bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while Elmer, as always, is the befuddled dupe.",1
"I especially love the great and unexpected ending, but I won't say more, as I don't want to spoil surprise. It's all very, very clever and funny and I don't care how old you are, this cartoon will make you laugh unless you are a grouch. However, determining which is THE best is irrelevant - - just watch them both and enjoy.",1
I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.,1
"Ha, ha, ha! "" Bugs Bunny says "" Yes? "" Daffy screams. "" Daffy tells Bugs he'"" desthpicable. "" This is more than Daffy can stand.",1
"Try and see it. One for all the family. I watched Love Life on holiday, when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida.",1
"The two male leads both received Oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so. While tragic overall, the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout. So far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth.",1
Rabbit! Duck!,1
He rules! Bugs of Daffy. Elmer really is to blame for all this.,1
"It's Rabbit Season! "" Daffy Duck!",1
"! She may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy, but the material lets her down. Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women ; there'not enough movies out there like this one.",1
I have seen most of the work she has done and enjoyed each one.,1
"< br / > < br / > The villains aren't really villainous enough and the lovers not intense enough. This slows the pace considerably. As another reviewer mentioned, I was also worried about the big dog choking on chicken bones! Billie "" Buckwheat "" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes.",1
Bumbling Willie Best & feisty Louise Beavers play Miss Lawrence's slaves. Here were two of the finest young actors to ever appear in American movies. Genial Ralph Morgan is especially good as a sympathetic Union general - his scenes with Spanky are quite amusing. The little GANGsters would henceforth stick to short subjects.,1
"I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Assy drinks too much and "" plays by his own rules "" as you might have guessed.",1
"It's like a crime dramedy. It's difficult to describe this show. Literally. """,1
"Assy McGee is an out - of - control, hard - nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas. The sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme. The twist here is that Assy is literally a walking buttocks. Each episode clocks in at a mere 8 - 9 minutes, so you really have little to lose. The title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever, subtle humor used throughout. < br / > < br / > If you have access to the Adult Swim comedies, Assy McGee is certainly worth the watching. Though the voice is slurred, the diction is somehow clear and easy to understand.",1
"To which title character snaps off the one - liner : "" I'm going... to shoot you. "" For instance, while breaking up a bus robbery, one of the criminals stops to ask Assy, "" Hey, where are you going, asshole!? "" Assy McGee is a show that you really have to be a certain age to appreciate. Think it's brainless, infantile poop humor? Go watch the Stallone film'Cobra'and you'll see what I mean.",1
"The think box at Assy Mcgee's headquarters are so far, consistent and on cue. It's a talking, trigger happy, alcoholic ASS COP!",1
Blessed Be! i hate her i would rather her character die that Shannon's. This was it! < br / > < br / > FOREVER CHARMED!,1
!,1
pay more attention next time!,1
"Piper is pronounced dead, and a SWAT team moves in. So Prue has to use her magic on the crowd, and they go to the hospital. Up on the surface, Prue and Piper are battling Shax. The problem here is that the crowds are blocking the driveway. Phoebe agrees, but the deal will shatter them.",1
"he is dead. demon kills doctor. but this time phoebe isn't there to say the spell to fend demon off. she agrees, tempus turns back time. ( NEEDS THE POWER OF THREE ) leo comes heals them both and so on.",1
this episode was sad. Shax blows in and blasts Prue and Piper. Prue was the strongset of all of them. For Now. But they get their to late and Piper dies. Prue is dead and so is the Power of Three.,1
"Prue and Piper bring Dr. Griffiths to their home to save him from the Sauce's assassin Shax. The source proposes Phoebe to stay with him and in return he would save her sister. < br / > < br / > "" All Hell Breaks Loose "" is a good but incoherent episode. My vote is nine. With Piper dead and The Power of Three destroyed, why should The Source revert time to save her? They become national sensation with a crowd in front of their house.",1
"Phoebes calls Leo to heal Piper and Prue. They got to the hospital but Piper didn't make it. and Prue uses her powers to throw her out. Meanwhile Phoebe is in the Underworld. This is what happened. So Leo heals them. and then Cole says, "" So you can save one of your sisters lives. """,1
"The plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility. A real pity it has not been remade, but perhaps it is period piece better left alone. A mix of mystery, suspense, and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of Vertigo.",1
"com, Internet searches, and am completely frustrated. The acting is superb. I've seen it twice and still am puzzled at some parts. I've tried e - bay, Amazon.",1
"Naturally, it's not available on any media! P. S. So sad that Joan Hackett left us so tragically young. You never see anything there before the mid - eighties. Think about that!",1
It grabs you at the beginning and keeps you guessing throughout the whole movie. I remember seeing this movie 34 years ago and it was full of suspense and twists.,1
A Love story as powerful as this should be around for all lovers to see. It was truly brilliant. Many thanks to Julie for her graciousness and friendship. Please contact me at shawe49 @ aol. She is waiting for book that it is based on. I have Never forgot this movie.,1
Would love it on VHS if someone has a copy.,1
was especially good. Yashimo.,1
This show was a delight to watch. I agree with all aforementioned comments.,1
Fast times was more depressing than funny. This movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong. Someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life.,1
But the movies from the 80's are best. Bands that had some balls. This movie exemplifies that! Party!,1
"Perhaps anyone who reads this can comment and clarify. Thanks. Other than Footloose, The Wild Life is the film that I remember Chris most from.",1
This movie was really funny.,1
Onlytaniels gave it a 5. It does very much have the feel of a Cameron Crowe movie. Of course The Wild Life is no Ridgemont. RIP The Colonel 1931 - 1997.,1
Fast Times it ain't.,1
Classic 80s movie is worth multiple looks. I rate both highly.,1
"The two characters work well off one another. Think a younger, hipper Odd Couple, complete with 80's gloss. Finally, the movie ends with one of the best 80's party scenes on film, ever. That's saying something! Throw in a score by none other than the man himself, Eddie Van Halen, and you can't go wrong. This definitely holds true. If Spicolli was high on coke instead of weed, he would be Drake.",1
I highly recommend it.,1
"It is a classic. Straight up, I love this film. Tommy's world is his own. All he wants to do is have fun. He has an innocence about him. "" I love everything about it. It is a perfect scene. And he comes out with some great lines.",1
This was such a great film.,1
During the interview HAL reacts as a humble working machine trying to accomplish the mission of the spaceship fully. HAL is curious to see those sketches and brings up his doubtful question about the purpose of the Jupiter mission. HAL begs him to stop HAL uses his final apologetic techniques to convince Dave of not disconnecting him. His conscious makes him capable to try to save his life from termination. CS3 class made me to see the movie again with another perspective : Who is HAL and what is he thinking? His style of movie making is still fresh and intact. < br / > < br / > In the next few scenes we will see how HAL tries to kill astronauts one by one and takes the power.,1
"after this movie, that changed. an enigmatic start for an enigmatic film. the special effects are incredible. that ape was Man. it's terrific.",1
"2001 : A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen. 10 out of 10, no doubt.",1
"My compliments to the chef, Mr. Kubrick. But still, it's a good film. Strange, but good. Even though, 2001 : A Space Odyssey is a good film.",1
"Loved the colour grading, especially in the night club sequences. Great music and a truly original voice at work here. Never heard of the film - maker before or his other films ( thank you IMDB ). Nine out of ten and well worth rental charge.",1
"Are they right? That thing, my friends, is beauty. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to rent that movie the same evening.",1
Made without CGI on a very lean budget in today's adjusted figures. Stanley Kubrick is without doubt the greatest director in History thus far. < br / > < br / > If you don't like it then you belong to Bollywood or your a true Aussie.,1
"Perhaps the slow pace isn't such a bad thing, after all. It basically means you're not bored while watching it. A film, first and foremost, should be good storytelling. < br / > < br / > Hence, 7 stars out of 10 from me. Boy, I had goose bumps, big time. You either will ( like it ) or you won't. That alone is a good reason to watch it if you haven't done so yet.",1
"There was no cartoon, no coming attractions. Remember this film was made before the first moon landing. But, SURPRISE! The ride had just begun. I went because I knew I was seeing a work of art.",1
"A computer. There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. It provokes two reactions and one is called : sleep. The score is legendary. The monkeys go Apesh! For the next hour Kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space. It starts with nothing, but a pitch black shot for well over two minutes. The editing is atrocious.",1
A lesson in evolution? And there is plenty of time. 2001 : A Space Odyssey < br / > < br / > Is it a sermon?,1
Spoilers ahead. It is a film that you could meditate on. We soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia.,1
"This is to illustrate the beauty of it. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies. This movie is not just good, its amazing. or just a waste of time. On the peak of evolution, we set out into the never - ending adventure as simple primates. But this movie has more to it than this. ridicules? Beauty, beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers.",1
"And also, Zarathustra said that "" man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman. "" The fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence.",1
"< br / > < br > Or not, depending on the audience.",1
"A vg Brit rom - com, one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy.",1
The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man... It is one of the very few great films of our times...,1
"Circles and arcs represent nature. Maybe. Mystery is more profound than explanation. I rarely use the word "" masterpiece "" to describe a movie.",1
The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made.,1
"I write this review just after hearing of Stanley Kubrick's death. 2001's ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star - child's flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand. He will be missed.",1
"< br / > < br / > Or maybe'm just plain crazy... One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. If it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you as well. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way.",1
"What are they? The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Experience it for more clarification. < br / > < br / > The story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution. Take note CGI people.",1
Most of this film takes place in space. 2 ) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. Faces are the key element of Kubrick film.,1
"But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? < br / > < br / > Beauty is an under - rated concept. It requires you to relax. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. < br / > < br / >'2001'requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films.",1
"Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that's the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it's up to the audience to continue. It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up. The film's greatest strength is in the details. < br / > < br / > 2001 is primarily a technical film. Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species.",1
"), kids would have hated. It's a case of a good message with too much singing - - even if the guy singing is Frank Sinatra. < br / > < br / > The film begins with Sinatra on stage singing.",1
"< br / > < br / > Sinatra aficionados and others should listen to both back to back and compare. The meaning could not be clearer. When he died that position eventually fell to Nelson Riddle. The album is now a rarity and it shouldn't be. And catch this worthwhile film whenever it is shown. Stordahl does the orchestration for the short and the Columbia record, Riddle for Reprise record.",1
"< br / > < br / > Sinatra drives his point home with a wonderfully heartwarming rendition of "" The House I Live In, "" which was written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol. It's sometimes difficult to watch such self - avowed "" message films "" from an earlier, seemingly - simpler era without a certain degree of cynicism. The music ain't bad, either.",1
The features showcased battle stories or war related themes. An RKO Short Subject.,1
"I can only assume this was for money reason. Now, was it a horror? By the end, I was hooked. Not really.",1
Could of used a better ending though.,1
The cast was also pretty good IMO. !,1
in the end if i had to recommend a show it will be king of queen.,1
"Wife of year. He is drop - dead hilarious, and angry. This show is amazing!",1
if not a root beer will have to do. ),1
I have just started watching this show.,1
Helen Mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her. Praise for Robert Glenister!,1
"THE KING OF QUEENS, "" in my opinion, is a pure CBS hit!",1
"< br / > < br / > Doug and Carrie deal with day - to - day domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves. If you put Seinfeld aside, this is The Best Comedy ever, no doubt! His constant presence and often bizarre behavior add to their daily adventures. < br / > < br / < br / > < br / > "" The King Of Queens "" just finished its eighth season of domestic bliss. Just Great!",1
I pray that the show never ends. This plot comedy has alew ( 8 ) of them. net Sicerely John. My hat off to the crew. That's what makes it so amazing.,1
"Advancing age didn't spoil the fun, anyway. Each one of them is a firsthand comedy actor. I spontaneously and continually and promptly liked it.",1
This is the best comedy period. It is so underrated!,1
This is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on TV. She truly makes the show... along with Jerry Stiller!,1
"Non stop laughs, need I say more? After one episode, I was hooked.",1
"He often gets himself into trouble and Doug and Carrie have to drag him out of the mud. Watch and have fun, I give it a 9 out of 10.",1
But KOQs comes real close. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld.,1
And with good reason!,1
"As is my fervent hope. < br / > < br / > Mirren, herself, has said that she'll make no more movies in the series, but, excellent as she's always been in the role of Tennison, the series, itself, is as "" actor proof "" as is another addiction of mine - Dick Wolf's American "" Law & Order "" - whoever appears therein, each could go on forever. She is, essentially, an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and is certainly no man - hater. I'm surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this t. v. movie... as far as I'm aware, the series itself, has had a huge following, reviewer pundits and real people alike, have praised it to a person.",1
"< br / > < br / > This a great series and I was sorry when it cancelled. Some episodes would be outrageously hilarious, and then some would only be mildly funny. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I guess my husband and I are a little slow. She is one tough cookie! But we still watch it almost daily on TBS. So, I'm not sure it had the quality of writers that Seinfeld or Raymond had.",1
"if you just want to relax. It had a good run. See also, Becker. And, overall, amusing and pleasant sitcom fare, esp. Amiable Doug is a good match.",1
I need help identifying an episode of King of Queens. Don't know what network I saw it on.,1
This is one of the funniest shows on TV today. It hits the mark 99 % of the time.,1
King of Queens is comic genius. You will not be disappointed.,1
"< br / > < br / > But besides all of that... < br / > < br / > This show was freaking hilarious. The King of Queens "" could be divided into two eras.",1
! I'm so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem. These guys truly understand what is funny. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! Check it out if you haven't!,1
"Thanks for great show.. I love all the cast, they are so funny. Thank you AA. I rate it one of the best ever.",1
"Nearly every teenager ( and adults ) watch this sitcom. Here in Germany "" King of Queens "" has a big big cult status! It's really awesome!!",1
"Critics of this show obviously don't get it - - or haven't watched the show "". Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud. The writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they appear at first ( this is far from "" According to Jim "" ). And the yelling - - the best episode is when they show him as a kid yelling "" Lemon Icee!! And of course, Jerry Stiller is brilliant as Arthur.",1
Very good stuff which only gets better from series to series.,1
I only wish it were out on DVD already... ( * sigh * )... Courtney makes an ideal foil.,1
as Doug would say. Excellente!!,1
What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had.,1
"< br / > < br / > When this TV movie got produced, I got quite an understanding. She was fine. With the onset of MTV, it got worse. Didn't know it. What upsets me is that I am writing "" of that time "" and seeing "" now "".",1
"It is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged. But on starting to view it, then I was hooked. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.",1
"He seems to have regretted making this film, and that may very well be why it is unavailable in any form. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. As the years have passed ( almost 25 to be exact ) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity.",1
I hope you enjoy it. Some other actresses may have struggled with this.,1
"Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details. < br / > < br / > Cynthia Gibb ( portrays Karen ) was not a fine election. Someone with a stronger personality.",1
"Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent. Also, Karen was beautiful but had a bad hairdresser. My choice for playing Karen is Hilary Swank. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was.",1
"Richard's struggle with drugs, and Karen's brief marriage. I know that she is in Heaven and probably entertaining everyone with her beautiful voice. ! God bless you, Karen! Cynthia Gibb was great at portraying Karen, and Mitchell Anderson was okay as Richard. There are some other moments in the movie as well. After I first saw it, I thought it was wonderful. I would not believe that it was her decision.",1
< br / > < br / > Altogether this is another magnificent police procedural drama.,1
The film could have touched so much more on that. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life.,1
"If you buy it, you will wonder why they waited. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face ; he figures she really can't sing. It's some of Karen's best work. < br / > < br / > Watch this movie! Nicely done!",1
"I wish I did know Karen personally! ! I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. I would have DIED to meet her!! For, my mother was often unfeeling, critical, and disapproving as Agnes was ( if this was true to accuracy ).",1
"Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality.",1
Why is she not found in No. Even in fairly advanced stages regular medication and counselling can be effective. < br / > < br / > Has Meethi's search ended? < br / > < br / > Like me most of the audience in the theatre appeared confused at the abrupt ending. It leaves lot of questions hanging in terms of the plot. 15?,1
"comeundone, I love you! My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well ; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly.",1
It immediately brings out Anjali's personality to the audience.,1
"The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called "" Good "". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much.",1
"But in real, Taylor was Ben. It was Taylor all the time. Why???",1
"and he does. As fate would have, Mithi and her fiancée meet up when they both are out on a trip. In all her world comes down upon her. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. He takes her to a place in Kolkata which supposedly looks like her husband'home.",1
"It's basically the exact same film as the original ; obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80's to the nth degree. I haven't seen either the early 80's "" Revenge of the Stepford Wives "" or the mid 90's "" The Stepford Husbands "", but this "" The Stepford Children "" is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film. At least The Harding family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford.",1
"yeah maybe better than Mr and Mrs Iyer. Konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. this might just be her best performance as an actor and Aparna's best as a director. ! Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali, Mithi's ( Konkona Sen's ) elder sister.",1
But the ending befits the theme of the film. There appear to be some loose ends. It is almost like an intense religious belief. Ultimately what is reality? Konkana Sen Sharma gives equally befitting performance as the schizophrenic. The open ending reflects this reality.,1
"Until you see 15 Park Avenue you cannot imagine feeling thrilled and moved at the same time. If the first one goes down in history as a débutant's clean sweep the latter will definitely carve a special place as a "" mature "" film. Along with the depiction of a delusional mind, Sen's magic has brought forth many little nuances of human relationships as they sustain stress and strain. Bravo!",1
It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. '. Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.,1
"Aparna Sen's 15 Park Avenue is a film about nature of reality. When a boy offers to marry her, her father and step - sister passionately try to convince him against taking such a step. A friend recounts with admiration an experience with a holy person claiming to hear hallucinatory voices. That's been the case since beginning, and lot more powerful people than Mithali in the film, among them Bruno and Galileo, have suffered as a consequence. < br / > < br / > In other words, accepted reality is what a majority or an influential minority believe in. < br / > < br / > Her mother doesn't see the irony in allowing a ghost - buster to treat her of the delusions.",1
The most beautiful film. Simply awesome!!,1
What right have we to deprive them of their source of happiness?,1
"Anu should already know all that. Social rehab is standard therapy along with all the deadly mind - altering drugs. Waheeda, Rahul and Shefali play their limited roles very well.",1
"Impossible ones, at times? < br / > < br / > Konkona, as Meethi, is outstanding!!",1
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address "" Mithi / Mithali "" ( Konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning. "" Hats off to her, for this great movie!! ! The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient ( Mithi ).",1
"The Stepford Children, besides being a very good made for TV movie, shows the very disturbing result of indoctrination. I am at the starting gate... waiting. I hope to one day see this movie on DVD.",1
Also there seemed no central theme to the movie. Its like cut pieces are joined together to make the movie. I must say it was a let down.,1
"in a simple word "" a wonderful experience. my sincere thanks to director aparna sen who has done a excellent job again.",1
"With this thought, and a mild sense of embarrassment that I hadn't watched the complete film earlier, I watched this film last Saturday.",1
"and they returned home thoroughly disappointed. rather its intention is loud and clear. it questions every human being's, sane or not, sense of reality. meethi bravely, madly, sincerely does that. and society labels her as'' schizophrenic''.",1
She and her schizoph This man really amazes me with the variety of work he has done. Her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie.,1
"I absolutely loved the way Aparna Sen wove these commentaries into the story. Konkona did a fantastic job, bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when her world and the real world clash. < br / > < br / > - The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for "" maya "". Konkona Sensharma beautifully conveys that the world Mithi is living in is as real to her as ours is to us.",1
"But later on, it started sinking in. ! It left me confused and maybe even a bit disturbed. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.",1
It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has!,1
It was THE hit of our Home Movies Time! 1955. The outstanding production values are apparent. 00 on close - out at a Downtown Chicago Camera Store.,1
"< br / > < br / > Nine years ago, my son was diagnosised as autistic. My dad had this movie as an 8mm reel.",1
And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950.,1
"Welts were all over Backlund! George "" the Animal "" Steele was far from a crowd pleaser, as well. A maniacal Sgt. This led a legendary and bloody alley match with commentator Pat Patterson. Some of these seemingly very real moments stand out.",1
All the biggest events happened on this show at the time. Every Saturday morning at 11 a. m. I watched Superstars. I don t recall any titles changing hands on this show.,1
"Adds to the historical value of this terrific film. That, based on the hammer and sickle, could only have been the People's Revolutionary Army of Mao Tse Dung!!! I loved it all.",1
"Sally Eilers is much more so. < br / > < br / > If you want to spot John Wayne, spot J. Carrol Naish first, they end up together. It's no "" cheapie "".",1
"Wellmann had been an air ace in World War One, and no one knew biplanes like he did. I dare not give away the ingenious aspects of that particular episode. The story is a sad one, played with genuine pathos, and well directed. Eilers is a real sizzler.",1
"< br / > < br / > This film is a pre - code because of several reasons. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.",1
"The cast in this movie was real good to watch. I was absolutely blown away, it was terrific. Barbara Eden did a bang up job as usual.",1
"Tom Brown is good as Barthelmess brother, fresh from his success in Wyler's "" Tom Brown of Culver "". < br / > < br / > Great special effects, good flying stunts, swiftly paced film ; in all, highly entertaining. Don't miss it whenCM airs it again.",1
! The music is impacting.,1
"Long Live Riverdance! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will.",1
Wonderful music.,1
"Tarik Winston is unbelievable, as is his partner in the piece. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. In Dolby 5. The feet, the faces, the overall view.",1
There's never been anything like Riverdance! It's well he left the show. This is one to get.,1
"This is just a very solid show with few weak spots. I prefer Dunne because Flatley's ego is so big he gets annoying at times. I also enjoyed the dancing of Maria Pages, a Spanish flamenco performer, and two guys : Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. Both are extremely talented. Butler and the rest of these women have the greatest legs I've seen on dancers. This is a "" revised "" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. < br / > < br / > The "" fast "" Irish songs here appealed to me most.",1
"In Tony Hawk'Pro Skater 2x, the graphics are rendered A LOT better. Hopefully this review benefits your needs. Graphics are nice, and clean, that's all I have to say. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x offers a new career mode, and that is the 2x career.",1
"There's also versions for PS1. I give it an 8 / 10 for n64. Dang! The graphics aren't that good. Overall, this game is awesome. There's create a skater, which is pretty cool.",1
Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again? Thanks Taira tcampo23 @ aol. No one is familiar with the fact that there was children version.,1
who knows. This game rocks.,1
"). I like contemporary films but also dig the old ones for what they worth. It's not a bad film, and I place it above Alive without hesitation. Just give it a break.",1
"The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. The unknown young Mexican actors do a great job and the musical score is endearing. Still, this is a good film that shouldn't be bashed like too often is the case.",1
"Recently, I found a copy on video and checked it out again. Badly made, sure... schlocky fun, most definitely. It still packs an entertaining punch. Survive "" is long overdue for DVD special edition treatment.",1
"< br / > < br / > But what are they? < br / > < br / > I recommend this one if you want a simple, fun, and - above all - enjoyable watch. You won't regret it! ).",1
It'Great! I think she did a great performance. Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie.,1
"Yeah, worth watching. In fact, this movie is, too. Oh well. I can't find anywhere online or on DVD or on VHS.",1
I LOVE this movie.,1
The film creates a moving narrative with laugh - out - loud moments and caught - breath sorrow. It matters. It has wit heart and stunning originality.,1
This movie WILL on DVD. I'm emailing them now.,1
also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.,1
where did all the good movies go? i want them back. i love this movie. have great day is it on air anymore?,1
it was fun a fun movie. we watched it every chance we got. My kids loved this movie.,1
Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. What ever happened to Disney? I never forgot this movie.,1
( do you believe in reincarnation? ),1
"I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!! ! Now if only Disney would show it just ONE more time! ^ _ ^ Go Susie Q.!",1
this is really a good movie.,1
"Heck, I remember being Tessa.",1
"Grabbing butts / physical domination isn't going to make it right. < br / > < br / > The movie was enjoyable. ? Furthermore it is very stereotyped. How often have we seen scenes where the woman says "" no "" but obviously doesn't mean it? Did he really think forcing himself onto a woman with no respect for her feelings was the way to go? No means no.",1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program.,1
The rest of the cast also play well. He learns about life and love rapidly.,1
"No way! ), they feel like REAL PEOPLE!",1
But that's just me. Cool and recommendable.,1
I give it 9 out 10. It was so realistic and funny. As a former Erasmus student I enjoyed this film very much.,1
"If you'young, learn by this example.",1
My favorite film this year. It brought to mind The Big Chill or The Breakfast Club. I wish more films like this were made.,1
< br / > < br / > WATCH IT!,1
"Maybe that'why we go to movies. As I wrote, the characters as well as these situations are familiar to all of us and therefore we can enjoy living their lives for awhile.",1
and whether it may be released?,1
"So, he advice him to go Spain.",1
"Wouldn't < br / > < br / > you use a more common word like "" université ""? Why doesn't Xavier < br / > < br / > talk to the Erasmus students he meets back in Paris? I thought this was full of ( silly ) clichés and < br / > < br / > that it basically tried to hard. Why does < br / > < br / > he just walk off?",1
"Cedric Klapisch's movie L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE is easy, breezy charm wrapped in nostalgia for our younger years and attractive youths. ).",1
"The Erasmus program encompasses some 30 countries from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of which are not EU members. < br / > < br / > One might ask why Klapisch chose protagonists who were all from long - established EU member countries in Western Europe. The German character features a few more tried and tested stereotypes. Klapisch ( the director ) went to the New York Film School from 1982 - 85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience. Another is a Gambian - Spanish or rather Gambian - Catalan male who appears a bit invented.",1
Cliché - avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. Pas du tout! Nothing positive.,1
"The English guy was the perfect "" geezer "" stereotype. I highly recommend this film. Drunk, annoying, insulting but shines through in the end.",1
Need I say more about bath tub scene. < br / > < br / > Great editing! Her mind spoke before her heart. In moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win.,1
Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are brilliant as Sir and his Dresser.,1
"Our French guy will also get there. L'Auberge Espagnole "" collected the audience wherever it was shown. They are full of unusual ideas for life. But they don't neglect their aspirations. A year is a very long time. They like jokes. And it is not strange.",1
"He finally succeeds, and Wendy probably has the night of her life. The Spanish landlord is also 100 % accurate. If you haven't seen it, do so. < br / > < br / > This is one of the most moving films I've ever seen, and the reason is probably that I've been in a very similar situation. The flat looks EXACTLY like all the Erasmus shared flats I've seen in Madrid. - The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martine, who remained in Paris, is also very typical.",1
"Xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities, his faults. He left this point low - key. The message that the author wanted to transmit isn't difficult to guess. Now, where to find the second example? It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. < br / > < br / > Moreover, the director wasn't really interested by his main character's studies.",1
"L'Auberge Espagnole "" is one of those movies viewer becomes sad when it ends. My vote is eight. He is advised to have a specialization in Spanish economy and language to get a good position.",1
"Overall a very nice nostalgic film, which becomes even more interesting because of the multinational cast.",1
The characters could not better represent their different countries. The movie is also quite funny yet not like all those stupid American college movies.,1
"This is what the scifi lovers want. OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast!",1
"Thanks ( IM A HUGE ELVIS FAN! ) Steven, "" Mr. I miss you guys and hope you are well. Brand! "" It was a magnificent cast and crew and I'm just so glad to be apart of it! They are fantastic people who are incredibly funny.",1
"com but its not there. Even the soundtrack will do. I liked the movie. I tried CD baby, not there either. I just need the title names along with singer.",1
"I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia, so now I love it even more. < br / > < br / > I definitely recommend it....",1
The ending tells us that the husband was sentenced for 99 years in prison in real life. Surprisingly good made for T. V. Thriller. But that's just the typical Hollywood scene that provokes more trouble. The direction is also very good.,1
"My grade : B - Made - for - TV movies are often so so so similar. And is right to give this movie a ` 10'rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. Eric Close surprised me by playing his part really well. So many of them have the same feel to them. Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous.",1
"In almost one or two dates later, Chris asks Jennifer if she will marry him and she agrees.",1
"< br / > < br / > If you get a chance to give this one a look, please do so. It's production values are not exactly top - notch ( it is a TV movie, after all ), but if you can look past that, there is an excellent story to enjoy. At first, she is blinded by his assurances that he is innocent and her love for him, but as time passes she continues to be suspicious of him.",1
"Its surprisingly one of the better toons ever made. < br / > < br / > The humor is good too, on the sexy, suggestive andleazy side. It is very similar if not exactly like the Simpsons style. Boy was I wrong!",1
"Your software should already know that! ) I have the "" Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding "" DVD. One of my favorite episodes of "" Mork & Mindy "" was when they got to meet Robin Williams! I lack cable - vision and no longer have "" DirecTV "". ( Hey! But then again I adapted.",1
"I was a little let down. Though Gary Rat wasn't bad, the best of the three was easily Stripperella. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. It was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far ; seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much. I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show.",1
"A brilliant idea by the script writers. < br / > < br / > Alan is back, and this time he'armed with a razor.",1
"Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? How is a "" typical "" human alike or different than Rose?",1
"I remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out, bumps into Keller. I wish i could give an example but i cant recall any - exactly as it was said. SHE is FINE lol. The ending was bad as well.",1
"I'm not usually into dark / psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. I would highly recommend this one.",1
I am very proud of the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. I shot this movie.,1
People who like Euro flicks will like this one.,1
"OK, first, to all the haters : Get a life! I am better person for Heartbeeps.",1
"9 STAR. But there are very minor and can be overlooked. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. Lots of cool robots.",1
"Runaway Robot! "" THAT is no help to people who hadn't been aware of the movie. The film had NO help at all, promotion - wise : if there was an advertising promo on TV or radio, I didn't see / hear it.",1
I'm staggered. Just rent it.,1
"Objects fell to bits in his hands. T. S. L. O. E. B'cast Jason as'Edgar Briggs ', a well - meaning but incompetent agent for the Secret Intelligence Service. Though they had a row once His wife Jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did. Whereas John Steed wore a bowler hat, Briggs had a trilby. Yet, like'Inspector Clouseau ', he always seemed to come out on top at the end, much to the dismay of his colleagues. '.",1
"< br / > < br / > I gladly recommend this extraordinary movie. He was an unusual star. It's quite lowbudget, but, oh, very original and striking.",1
"Then we built a fortFort Invincible. "" But them'Paches is pretty smart. Douglas and company take studio bound sets and make them look convincing during the nocturnal hours. I'm a scout for the Army. Things was fine for a while. Only the Valiant "" qualifies as a gritty good western.",1
"The character he plays here is driven and, when necessary, ruthless. A pity! It contains good work by all the character actors and even Barbara Payton turns in a credible performance.",1
"Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians.",1
"Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. As Lance, young Gregory Peck is quite strong.",1
"< br / > < br / > A sleeper of a film, and a good solid western for fans of this genre. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive.",1
"The best part about "" Nurse Betty "" is it's unpredictability.",1
The film is like no other I have ever seen. My Grade : 10 / 10.,1
"Go see this movie in theater or at least rent it when it comes out! It was funny, but it also had many touching moments.",1
"I. It was'custard pie in the face'stuff really. The leading man, though, did not seem to enjoy experience of the show. S'('Secret Intelligence Service'). ','Hark At Barker'and the'Doctor'series.",1
The remainder of the cast fits well. This movie just might make you cooooo.,1
"9 out of 10. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smart.",1
< br / > < br / > The answer become less clear as the film goes on. A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people? < br / > < br / > Chris Rock though as foul - mouthed as usual is fairly subdued as Wesley.,1
"A strange mix of romance, violence and roadmovie. !",1
"Hard to understand, harder to explain. Rated 8 / 10. Chris Rock was good but not a standout.",1
"I will wipe off my mouth with soap and not mention any more soap names. 'Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. Enough! However, the only problem is that Betty thinks this is all real. It is like her mind is in ` another world.'Ok! To sum it up, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call in for ` Nurse Betty.",1
"And, lastly, there is Crispin Glover. Chris Rock's performance seems rather wooden, but he has his moments. You almost forget that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are searching Betty down. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. I guess I'm saying that I liked this movie quite a bit!",1
"The plot is very simple. ( and by the way "" The Truman Show "" dealt with this subject in a much better way ). And here comes the big question. The reference to "" The Wizard of Oz "" is obvious. Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film. What is the film all about? < br / > < br / > The film could be about obsession. It seems not to affect her at all.",1
"Renee Zellweger turns in an innocent, candy - coated, and sometimes terribly sweet performance as Nurse Betty. < br / > < br / > 7 out of 10 She exudes goodness, warmth, and is irresistible.",1
"With the obvious exception of Fools & Horses, this was in my opinion David Jason's finest series. ! By comparison, Porridge, Open All Hours and that awful series'Lucky Man'did not come close.",1
"I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore. 9 outa 10 < br / > < br / > Hell, Kiss the Girls was watchable with him in it.",1
"What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. The entire cast is strong, if not spectacular. 8 out of 10. Why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiots??",1
"Gosh, is this what life made us be?",1
"< br / > < br / > If that sounds crazy, it's because it is. This isn't a plot that has been cast in a familiar mold. Somebody went out on a limb. The ending is believable and poignant. And it's the writer's responsibility, John C. Richards. I give it bonus points for sheer originality.",1
"Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.",1
"Stop reading commentaries and go see it. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk. Alternately funny and touching, this movie is almost perfect.",1
"We almost believe what she is saying, yet we understand that her mind is fractured. Even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of Betty's ramblings, the music swells as she speaks, giving us, the audience, Betty's emotional perspective. She pours her heart out to him and he plays along, thinking she's auditioning for a part on the show. Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) lives her life through soap Opera "" A Reason to Love "" as a way to escape her slob husband and dull life. An example of this would be Betty'first meeting with her crush. Aaron Eckhart once again shows versatility in the thankless role of Betty's Indeed, such a plot makes one question the R rating, but it's warranted all right.",1
"By clearly defining the protagonist's difficult life, Nurse Betty justifies its character's tendency to turn away from reality. Meanwhile, the angered Charlie and Wesley track Betty down, convinced she is a dangerous witness who also knows about their compromising dealings with Del.",1
"She just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and her belong together. Just to let you in on the movie, she plays Betty. But I'm glad I did. "" When she meets the actor who plays Dave Revell, George ( his real name ) thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show. I can see why, she is an incredible actress.",1
Greg Kinnear is at his comic best as the vain actor / soap opera doctor. This has to be one of best cast films in recent years.,1
Certainly he is the one to teach people this art. I wish I could get hold of the series on DVD to watch again.,1
Nurse Betty is really an interesting movie. 5 / 10. The hit men however think that she knows too much and go after her to kill her. In real life she is an ordinary housewife who works at a diner.,1
"In Betty, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she's chasing thinks her genuine adoration is nothing more than a joke. Some might begin to wonder if LaBute is really some sort of misogynist himself - - considering that his recurring theme involves the downfall of innocent women.",1
"It shows Jacob Goodnight as someone who is human. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. He has a heart, no matter how twisted and creepy it is.",1
! He does a good job and the man is legitimately enormous!! They really drive it home and go for gratuitous violence just cause. Turns out a serial killer lives upstairs and he's removing his victims eyes to cleanse them of their sins.,1
A perfect 10 would have been awarded if that would have happened. Now where I really throw in a spoiler for a second warning. That's all. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie.,1
"Most of the teens are deservingly killable too so that works well. 7 out of 10. Not great but far better than Silent Hill or When A Stranger calls, and perhaps better than some of other crap that I wouldn't bother to see.",1
"When we saw this, we groaned. They really redeemed themselves with this movie. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. Just don't watch it in a hotel.",1
"He's a lot less one - dimensional than most horror heroes. Good, creepy, B - movie slasher fare. Lots of fun.",1
Definitely a horror movie lover must see. The sets are well make and very convincing.,1
See No Evil With Kane.,1
"I loved it! Now that I think about it, there is quite a bit of action in this movie.",1
That was his only look the entire movie. Most of them die except for 3 of them.,1
Yeah right! Rating 2. And I think the eyeball rip was bone - chilling. The title don't lie!,1
And no CGI crap. Finally a true horror movie.,1
So make sure that you rent or buy see no evil because it is just so great.,1
"Now he's a big scary chopping killing machine. Not that there is anything wrong with that. and a handful of adults. Yes WWE, Word Wrestling Entertainment, pro wrestling. See No Evil is the first film from WWE films.",1
"The film is actually pretty good. Why?? Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to "" See No Evil "" was....",1
7 out of 10.,1
"He sold the role really well, and really did look menacing. And stick around after credits too... Think of this movie as a modern day latter Friday the 13th film. It just seemed to cliché and looked like nothing new. So the WWE has done it. Considering this was directed by a porn movie director, I was quite surprised.",1
"Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. But that's not what slasher films are about. ), there's some good shots here.",1
And yet there is a certain... charm.,1
"The female cast members are all great and fun to watch. Watch and enjoy! Check this out, Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown - prince of soft - core horror.",1
"< br / > < br / > But all in all, this is a very worthy adaptation. ( Also, as far as I recall, Basil should have been killed seated at the table. ) He seems to equally wreak havoc on both sexes here, as he should according to the novel. Particularly Dorian's encounter with Sybil's brother suffers from the obvious studio look. I'm sure Wilde would have liked it. < br / > < br / > Finally, Jeremy Bratt plays Basil as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio, again a fitting interpretation.",1
"It's just not the same, is it?",1
"Both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil, with evil winning in the end. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers.",1
"The acting however is brilliant. My only other qualm is with hair styles. The wit, pathos and tension of Wilde's work have been remarkably transferred to the screen.",1
This is not the fault of the boys however. The quality is lacking in audio department. Only buy this DVD if you are a hardcore Rushian. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.,1
< br / > < br / > Cheers Iain.,1
"It's incredible! Go watch "" Rush in Rio "" for yourself. I guarantee it. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD.",1
Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Lets just hope and pray that they don't retire anytime soon! !,1
Hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride. < br / > < br / > I understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this. I think she graduated.,1
"This is a real live concert DVD. You listen to Rush just the way they sound in a live performance, no tricks, no tweaks. Rush in Rio is simply an amazing DVD. I hope you enjoy this magnificent concert from the greatest band on Earth. Awesome!!",1
"All they do is entertain! < br / > < br / > I give this DVD 100 out of 100. The lineup of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart is so talented that I want to listed to them play again and again.",1
We have rather firmly stood by them for years. Rush fans know the talent of these three Canadians.,1
This DVD is worth it! You get the best seat in the house for one of their best concerts given.,1
"The video editing is terrible in my opinion. More power to them! After about three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. This is in no way a slam of the crowd of Rio. This slick two - disc set shows Rush at their finest. If you attended the Vapor Trails tour, then you'll know what they'll be playing. I won't list the songs, in case you want to be surprised.",1
Each band member plays at a level that defies belief - real craftsmen performing art.,1
"How do these guys keep going? This DVD is their first concert in Rio, Brazil.",1
"Yes, I am aware of its flaws! It is captivating, watching the struggles & grief & loves of Sinute, physician! Personally, I regard "" The Egyptian "" in an extremely favourable light.",1
There were moments that made my hairs stand up! I have to admit that I had low expectations for this movie.,1
"), why they always left sir Finney with empty hands? Watch this film and enjoy! - and they all deserved the award!",1
This film is timeless!,1
"Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. However, the principal acting is a bit weak.",1
( In 1975 I visited Egypt! ),1
Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.,1
Soon i Hope will appeared. I have Lasser Disc version. Also oust anding was the superb score by Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann.,1
"Sinuhe is appointed Court physician, but becomes obsessed with the Babylonian courtesan Nefer. Although Akhnaton readily forgives him for his previous offences, Sinuhe finds the country in turmoil. As a baby, Sinuhe is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the river Nile and adopted by the physician Senmut and his wife. The main character, however, is not Akhnaton but rather the fictitious Sinuhe. In the course of the film, Sinuhe is revealed as the long - lost son of the previous Pharaoh and half - brother to Akhnaton and Baketamon.",1
The acting was good for a 1954 film. I don't know why they don't show it more often. I would rather watch this than some films they play more than necessary. What does that say about us? That is why I ended up watching it.,1
"< br / > < br / > There's another fascinating side : the movie looks like a flamboyant melodrama. Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel, it doesn't cheapen it! It came before "" the ten commandments "" "" land of the Pharaohs "" "" Ben Hur "" and it's overlooked today.",1
"Victor Mature, Michael Wilding, Peter Ustinov co - star. This Fox spectacle was a big hit when released in 1954. Check it out.",1
"< br / > < br / > I found the script to be excellent, and the vocal talent of Edmund Purdom quite impressive.",1
"< br / > < br / > What I like most about'Apocalypse Now'is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. It is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated. Rather, it is a film, which powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute'horror'of what was darkest military conflict of the previous century.",1
He is street wise and cunning a survivor. Note Psalm 104. and other Egyption imagery in the psalms? Her correct name. Performances as follows. < br / > < br / > Mr. Peter Ustinov provided the alter ego to Sinhue. Did his monotheism influence the Jewish people?,1
"Fox, are you listening? I'd give it 10 stars for that alone.",1
"Victor Mature as the ambitious Horemheb is also perfect. Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is sadly miscast. And when it goes wrong... Again, one of his best roles. Now for the bad. It's everything that has to do with the romance. He does have the perfect voice for the character. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. I'd say that a full 3 / 4s of the film is great.",1
"Nevertheless, this is a movie that should be credited for being as audacious in the small as it is in the large. Yes, that too, but so was Shakespeare. Tedious? ... as valuable as King Tut's tomb! Historically inaccurate? Too long?",1
Well there is a lot of Shakespherian tragedy and bunch of moral worth in it. This is not what one would term a happy tale.,1
"Stay tuned ). Does he? Have fun with this movie ; it's worth it. And what a story it is! I recommend it. One night, Sinhue sees a woman who makes him lose his senses. Yeah, right... still, she wasn't that bad _ I've seen worse. Sinhue and Horemheb grow up.",1
"Not one actor on ROME could pass for an ancient Italian. and its gorgeous cinematography and score. IRON! ) Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh? BRAIN SURGERY! Everything old is olde again.",1
"The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time ( 1955 ). I wait in great anticipation of such a film, there are already numerous books on the subject. Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E - bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. Maybe following "" The De Vinci Code "" book and film this film be re - made with the central secret being the foundation of our current monotheism! My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion. The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. In real life Nefer ( Nefertitti ) was the wife of Akhenaton.",1
I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! ).,1
"I can't picture anyone better for the role. This is a classic war movie. Also along for the ride are, Robert Duvall as an over the top DI with a penchant for "" napalm in the morning "" or at least the smell of it.",1
"Her screen name Darvi is formed from Zannuck's and his wife's first names. Victor Mature is, well, Victor Mature. Peter Ustinov is a delight to watch in this type of role, which he always did so well and so wittily.",1
"It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Excellent Film! * * * * Tommy Rettig, plays Thoth, the son of the Egyptian.",1
"Sinuhe, having been brought up in a simple family by his step parents, becomes a physician. and searching for the answer. < br / > < br / > Curtiz'movie also retains one rule that all films of First, he thinks that the only cure is revenge. Film historians have said much about ancient epics that have been the interest of many directors from the beginning of cinema. Who can forget his TEN COMMANDMENTS ( 1923, 1956 ) or THE SIGN OF THE CROSS ( 1932 )?",1
"The summit of the former were the religious poetry and "" The Epic Of Gilgamesh "". But "" The Egyptian "" is unique.",1
Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Decadent! ( One of the film Archaeological! Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities.,1
I've seen people on television with Tourettes syndrome and they don't just blurt out bad words. Unless I am incorrect. < br / > < br / > This episode was funny and just shocking.,1
"His mother then tells everyone that the kid has "" tourette syndrome "". La Petit Tourette is a pretty funny South Park episode.",1
"He is able to swear at the other kids at school. This was a funny episode about Cartman faking Tourette syndrome. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. I Recommen it to any South Park fan.",1
"It's great to spot a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. If you've never seen this film, skip original and head straight for Redux. This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world.",1
"Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody. South Park won an Emmy like a month or so before this episode aired ).",1
"< br / > < br / > cycle 5 : like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either. < br / > < br / > cycle 4 : Kahlen should have won. < br / > < br / > cycle 2 : its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it. < br / > < br / > cycle 7 : Caridee definitely deserved it. i didn't like her. eww!",1
"No. I've watched season 5, 6, 7 and in the middle of season 8. The judging is so over the top with it's criticism.",1
SO WHAT...............................,1
It is also on more that one channel. I was entertained 99. 9 percent of the time watching it.,1
"Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but apparently neither does ANTM. Having dabbled in the modeling industry ( as a model ), I watch this show with a slightly different view than most might. Though, I must add, ANTM may become tad tiring and dull, after watching several cycles, as it has become for me. While I admit ANTM can be a fun, and entertaining show, as the seasons go on it seems to continue to drift from any reality. I think not.",1
But this is just a show and every girl on there is very lucky to have this chance.,1
"There are no lenghts. < br / > < br / > So, give your brain a break ; If you can't beat them, join them, and have a good time watching this bit of reality TV with your loved ones. Well, at least, that's what I tell my friends. All of this slides smoothly with just the right beat. Because my girlfriend watches it, of course. Yes, I watch this show. It will make crave for more, somehow.",1
"It's as if they were competing with "" Fear Factor "". Shoots that look like re - enactments of fight < br / > < br / > I'll have to admit, the show is a guilty pleasure.",1
"America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. She doesn't have even 1 / 10 of Tyra's professional skills, which keeps Tyra Banks on the top.",1
"I would like to submit the following goof. They have duffe bags, packs and footlockers but not suitcases.",1
Serious fun! Just enjoy it for what it is. I didn't. And it so does!,1
"Yes, I am ashamed to admit it, but this show is positively DEVINE!! !",1
"It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear - jerker! See it, i'm sure you'll love it as much as I did!",1
I went to this film with no expectations. Give this one a shot!,1
"This film was both entertaining and thought - provoking. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot!",1
I saw this movie at the Philadelphia Film Festival today and enjoyed it overall.,1
"They are obviously wrong for each other, this much is clear. Three months after the death of his mother his father remarries his long time secretary. Yet they stick it out, for what?",1
"Fantastic documentary. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Meanwhile, wife # 2 was just the opposite. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.",1
"It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. Especially a documentary.",1
Quite the opposite : it made me feel good.,1
"They sent it up with room service. "" It is indulgent without being narrow and alienating.",1
"It is difficult to verbalize just how moved I was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. This film took me by surprise. ! As a matter of fact, I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with this!",1
It gets you thinking about your parents. This is a really great film!,1
"< br / > < br / > High recommended. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset.",1
"The filmmaker's particular success is to make the viewers actually see the young woman behind the elderly parent and grandparent. Although the stuff of Hollywood lurks in the details, Doug Block treats the story as he would everyday life. It is not a warning for those offered a glimpse into life of Block's parents. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary - maker.",1
"I saw "" capturing the friedmans "" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.",1
"Her top henchman is played by Douglas Kennedy, and it was no surprise to see Lane Bradford as one of the baddies. A quick check revealed that he appeared in'The Lone Ranger'show fifteen times, while Kennedy appeared a total of six times. Interestingly, the leader of the bad guys is an already wealthy woman, disarmingly portrayed by Noreen Nash. < br / > < br / > Aside from that, you have a fairly traditional Western adventure. Somehow however, this film got by me until I had a chance to catch it today courtesy of my local library.",1
Racial intolerance figures as the primary theme in the Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald screenplay. Our vigilante heroes ride to the rescue of Indians who are being murdered by hooded white hombres for no apparent reason. Selander was an old hand at helming westerns during his 40 years in films and television with over a 100 westerns to his directorial credit.,1
The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.,1

An excellent series.,1
"It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick.",1
"Influenced by Amy, Matt grows into a man of character and heart. Perhaps what's most impressive about FULL RIDE is its sense of reality. All of these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle.",1
"Folks, he isn't right size! He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. The football scenes at the end were perplexing. ( For me. ) The film was all right.",1
Both of these kids have come from troubled & dysfunctional homes. Matt falls in love with Amy & tries to straighten out his life for her. Very predictable ending.,1
It's a good movie. I liked this movie.,1

What a movie. < br / > < br / > Many Thanks.,1
"I just can't figure out if the the aging process is movies... or me. "" Friends "" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. I'm both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. It will bring back a lot of special feelings I'm sure. so forgive me for a rather poor review. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make.",1
"It's magical. ( It was their grave she was visiting in the opening scene. ) What can I say? The next day while riding together boy accidentally drives his car into a lake in a freakish solo car accident. < br / > < br / > The story is that a 14 - year - old girl is forced to move in with her cousin in Paris after both her parents die.

Very relaxing sound. Great Movie!,1
Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. ##rilliant actors and brilliant picture!! !,1
The story ( at the time ) hit home to my psyche.,1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released.,1
! I only wish it was on DVD now! She died a few months ago!,1
"So sad that "" Friends "" has never been released on DVD.",1
"( No DVD's yet ). Cinema is an art and as art it reflects not only human emotions but historical moments. Since they occur mostly at the heart's level ( no intellect yet! How deep? That was it. ), they define your soul's contours like a sculptor would do with a stone. Guys, be serious!! That's "" Friends < br / > < br / > So, I confess I feel nostalgia.",1
"In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Spain it's 12.",1
"< br / > < br / > Why is it not on DVD? I loved it, and the Elton John music. A generational thing?",1
"She was a beautiful and talented actress. < br / > < br / > VHS tapes of FRIENDS can be found at Amazon. Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.",1
zonadv. S Market.,1
"But I'd proberbly miss it in the TV guide even if it DID show up. I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think ( I'm 37 now ). ! I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else. < br / > < br / > Reading the reviews here has renewed my interest.",1
"Smelled like... victory. You smell that? Kilgore : Napalm, son.",1
I think 9 times in all.,1
"Alternative endings are not just for DVDs. In "" Paul and Michelle "", they separate for a time. The movie does let kids know that sex can cause babies. The camera does not focus on it, but it is there.",1
"< br / > < br / > I totally recommend this movie to anyone sixteen and over! I guess it is a really girly kind of movie, but it was so sweet and adorable! I thought to myself as I put the tape in the player, I was curious I get. I loved it! < br / > < br / > "" What controversy? "" Awesome!",1
"So long ago and so far away. Still original was fab, and if you can get a copy go rent it, just remember to give it its'due and treat it gently.",1
"These are not easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them. First love. Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? As an artistic piece, this movie is really a forgotten and rough gem. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. "" The photography is beautiful and it has scenes of great beauty.",1
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. The music is beautiful. It was unforgettable. I was about 17 years old at the time.,1
I was not disappointed.,1
"Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching.",1
"And Godfrey Cambridge, an actor who always managed to funny.",1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch.,1
"I was expecting a "" classic "" film, with lots of war. Willard's journey on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue Colonel.",1
This is a true 10 on the rating scale!,1
"In this film, he does a great job! My yardstick for measuring a movie's watch - ability is if I get squirmy. Predictable in some parts sure, but never boring.",1
The Nelsons ( Kay Francis and John Eldredge ) are forcibly employed by Gurney ( Bogart ) without objections. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. I think that character development and social identity can suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully examined. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into.,1
< br / > < br / > Rating : 3 stars out of 5.,1
"This is a good short film showing Bogart on his rise to stardom. Unfortunately, his shady deals come to light in a police raid, which hangs a shadow over his wife's career as well. His other gang members also function more as stooges than hoodlums.",1
< br / > < br / > Now you know why I gave it a 10 +! ! These characters were so real.,1
I loved this show. Iuld be first in line to purchase it.,1
< br / > < br / > I read some comments. This way I can see it from the beginning. It's on at 12 : 30 AM.,1
"The world inside the killer's head is not - - thank goodness! Wow! Graphic violence of a twisted, erotic nature in a surreal landscape - - even if beautiful - - is highly unpredictable. 6 / 10 for that.",1
I know I wasn't. I recommend you buy this one for your DVD collection.,1
"The acting I felt was definitely all - around up to par. With that said, I believe that this movie is astounding.",1
This one started excellently. The screenplay was awful.,1
"It's not simple. Be open - minded, and you will love it! How surprised I was! If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no - brains movies, this is not for you. I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie.",1
"team of cops follows the trail of ( particularly nasty ) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Sometimes horrifying, often pretty, a fairly gripping story told with care and attention by talented film people, but by no means the great leap into the unknown it has been marketed as.",1
"If you simply want a series of static shots, stick to stage plays and give up cinema altogether. This is essential to the film, as the entire premise behind it is the visualization of a serial killer's subconscious. < br / > < br / > The Cell is more of a visceral experience than a film.",1
THE CELL fascinated me at first glance.,1
In that respect it is a fairly large step above ` A Clockwork Orange. I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. It won't be half as good on tape. ENJOY! This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. But for those who like to be freaked out.....,1
"110 minutes ). But, of course, it is likely that there are much more different cuts. I don't want to go into a criticism of the movie which I think is - for a big budget movie - quite exceptional and daring.",1
"I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. He has major talent and this film has a lot of potential if you give it a chance. Overall, The Cell is a powerful, disturbing and avoids being too tacky which makes it a great, pleasurable watch.",1
"Vincent D'onofrio played amazingly well. Overall, I say this is a wonderful movie, with excellent acting and beautiful artwork.",1
"He was reportedly influenced by such directors as Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg. < br / > < br / > A sick, demented serial killer roams the streets. The filmmakers take advantage of every shot. I think it's one of the year's most engrossing films. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, "" The Cell "" is a love / hate movie - either you love it or you hate it. I can understand the reasons some people dislike this production. During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things. """,1
Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema.,1
"Lo looks stunning enough to add to the rest of tarsem's work. A bold new step in movie making. The Cell is a must watch. ! one of the most refreshing movies of this decade. this movie is a perfect case for the "" suspension of disbelief "" theory.",1
What Novak wants in return from Deane is whereabouts of Stargher's latest victim is and if she's alive.,1
"The focus swings as it must from saving the man to saving his victim. I had to shut it off from time to time and come back to it later. Nevertheless this was a watchable if somewhat disturbing film. After you have seen enough movies, there is very little that doesn't remind you of other movies.",1
"The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is that he changes a hoary old chestnut plot in to something quite different from what you're expecting. A serial killer, Carl Stargher, has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them drown in a water filled cell.",1
I would recommend for a scary thriller. I never got the chance to see it though.,1
It's an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer. The camera leaves regularities at door and traverses a world where up and down are the same. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. But it is without a doubt Vincent D'Onofrio that has the biggest impression here. < br / > < br / > The casting is top notch also.,1
"To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. The Cell "" has just opened the door to another world of imagination.",1
9 out of 10.,1
"And Vince Vaughn? Style over substance. The Cell "" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals. < br / > < br / > Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. I don't even know why he was chosen.",1
"Still I felt that Vince Vaughn was also miscast in this movie. < br / > < br / > The story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn't always make sense. < br / > < br / > "" The Cell "" is beautifully looking with impressive sets, costumes and make - up. Yes, it's real eye candy to watch all. Still "" The Cell "" is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see, due to its style, originality and creativity. It suited the movie well and gave some of the scene's some extra mood and atmosphere.",1
"Along the way, they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore "" Hoorah "" about the war. Willard does not go alone however. Kurtz, on the other hand wants to die. I decided I need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film. The sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, yet you can't lay your eyes off of it. When his next mission is given to him, he is baffled. """,1
"In fact, it is basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Lambs. < br / > < br / > The story of The Cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking. None that have ever been made even come close to it. In that movie, you didn't see insanity, you were THERE. The Cell is an incredibly well - made film, and it deserves to be recognized.",1
"Every room in the imagi This is dangerous for a lot of reasons. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. 2. In fact, the story is pretty good. < br / > < br / > The real story then. To find out where the girl is, Catherine has to go into Carl's mind. Carl just went into coma ; he has been sick for a long time.",1
Forget about the plot of this movie.,1
It was memorable and so welloignant. Madge Sinclair is the principal who loves her babies. < br / > < br / > Amazing that such backward students had a zest for learning and were well disciplined. < br / > < br / > The ending will just tug at your heart. I guess that answers my question. He has them go out and experience life by themselves by learning outdoors.,1
"( Can't anything, that is ). "" < br / > < br / > BUT don't you tell a'Young Turk ', such as Pat Conroy, that he can't. Those were that Pat Conroy was both an outsider and he was white ; with almost the entire population of this off - shore cay was black and very poor. In addition to the physical properties of this "" Little Red Schoolhouse "", any systematic and progressively graduated educational system was totally absent.",1
See this film. !,1
I'm going to make this short and sweet. Oh... one last bit of advice.,1
Should be seen by all.,1
Realistic.,1
"< br / > < br / > Besides a love of teaching, we also see another important point in this film. he didn't overplay role, and I found him to be totally believable. Voight is Conrack.",1
"It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks. Charlie Don't Surf "".",1
Well worth a look.,1
A solid performance that really makes you think.,1
"These kids were my peers, I was 6 in 1969 when Pat Conroy spent his year on Daufuskie. Education is about more than reading and writing. 2. < br / > < br / > Why this has not made it on to DVD yet?",1
"I've seen it 4 more times since. But I don't, I identify with the black kids. Learning AND fun? Together? ""..... "" So, It's a funny movie. God forbid.",1
It'beautifully done.,1
"It will stay with you! Or does it? This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of "" principle vs. pragmistism "". A great film with a heart - breaking ending.",1
"The truth is, you can't blame the movie for that ; it was based on Conroy's real experience. Either way, the movie's a real gem. He proceeds to enlight them about all these factors.",1
< br / > < br / > I can think of no better movie about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life.,1
"Martin Ritt, DP.",1
This film had me spellbound this evening. Who would they have chosen?,1
"The loss of civilization, the loss of judgement, of self. And a progression - or retreat? By the time they do, Kurtz's methods don't really seem as wrong or as they should, and they certainly don't seem too unusual or out - of - place. The story is of Willard, a general commissioned on a special mission to Cambodia after his first tour of duty in Vietnam is served.",1
An evil land baron is holding up water to a group of ranchers in order to try and take their properties for pennies on the dollar.,1
! Lots of good ridin'and shootin '!!!,1
"You'll discover who the killer is just as William Marshall does. Well - worth restoring and reviving on cable - TV, VHS or DVD. The ending is as much of a surprise as is this sadly forgotten, classy murder mystery.",1
"Truly a wonderful film. The film's Theodore is just the "" Music Hall. "" Just thought you would like to know.",1
"Yes, it's flawed : the cheapness of the production shows through, the dubbing is awful and Laurel and Hardy were too old to do the energetic slapstick of their greatest films. Utopia, "" a. k. a. "" Escapade "" has got over the years has come from the horror stories Stan Laurel told of its production. Not since Bette Davis's 1933 vehicle "" Ex - Lady "" have I seen a film that was so much better than its star said it was!",1
"Or because it's not made by the Hal Roach studios or 20th Century Fox? The movie is not halve as bad as people want to make you believe it is. Both of them retired from movies after completing this one. Or is it because of the lack of Laurel & Hardy regulars? He was well over 60 years old already. < br / > < br / > Sad to see in what poor form Stan Laurel was at the time of making this movie. It also makes this movie better than most of their movies together from the'40's. A shame, because they are still the ones that really carry and make the movie.",1
"Our heros are left on their own desert island. It's such a metaphor for the real life truth. I particularly enjoyed the bedtime scene. However, his health probably wasn't up to much.",1
"The film was made, on locations in Spain, in 1949. Also realizing the most from her role, Patricia Roc. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight.",1
"I saw it again on video recently. The music theme is intensely tragic, and from the outset one knows that it heralds failure or death.",1
"is not so much seen as experienced. stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential. "" The "" Apocalypse Now! "" < br / > < br / > The movie is rather episodic.",1
So go see it! Everything about it is funny.,1
! I appreciate those films.,1
It will have you laughing every time you see!,1
Very very funny.,1
The same goes in reverse.,1
"Eric Allen Kramer doesn't have much to do, but the few scenes he does have are binding. You have Cary Elwes who's charming and talented, but he can't do comedy.",1
"It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS!",1
"Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target, he tries with some success to understand why. My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall's Lt. We need to sick Gary Oldman on him. But what will he decide to do once he finds him? What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? Colonel Kilgore. Apocalypse Now does this perfectly.",1
That is a timeless scene. What makes this movie special you say? Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force.,1
I first saw Robin Hood : Men in Tights back in 1994 in the cinema. After I saw the movie I must say it was even better than I thought. It's just non - stop laughing.,1
High recomended!,1
"< br / > < br / > Everyone else : This is a classic. Some of them don't work, but most do, and well. I discovered new jokes fifth and sixth time I watched the film! This isn't an Academy Award winner, it's Mel Brooks. You know what it is when you're getting into it. That's a given.",1
Watch it!! Mel Brooks is insane. I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody.,1
Might contain spoilers. The songs were rather lame.,1
It was hilarious!,1
"I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it.",1
"Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. I Love this movie! He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film.",1
This movie is Wonderful!,1
This film is wholly different from ` The Godfather. But Willard both gains and loses. Spoilers. The horror spoken of is the reality of war. < br / > < br / > At first it does appear to be another war film.,1
! < br / > < br / > The musical numbers were so imaginative!,1
"< br / > < br / > It's definitely worth watching, quite hilarious indeed! Some moments really made me crack up so hard! lol ) and everyone else!",1
"I knew at the time I wasn't seeing great art, but just a campy, goofy, though always laugh - worthy take on Robin Hood and / or adventure movies. Along the way he meets Achoo ( Dave Chappelle ), butts heads with Prince John ( Richard Lewis ) and the Sheriff, and of course still pines for the love of Maid Marian. This, of course, is the usual clothesline for Brooks to let the comedy run off into the scenes, and while sometimes a joke may not work or might becometale on a repeat viewing, so much of it sticks that it's hard not to chuckle.",1
as well. Why does the Sheriff hate Robin so much? < br / > < br / > Highly recommended. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood.,1
The random outbursts of songs were brilliant and well and the musical score used I really really liked.,1
"The music is marvelous, as is the choreography of both dancing and fighting. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. It's funny from start to finish, none of the comedy is overdone or boring.",1
"Desperate for a familiar face, he finds the family's loyal blind servant Blinkin sitting on toilet with a Jazz mag in Braille. That's the basics! I remember when I first saw this movie. < br / > < br / > Now, you all know the Robin Hood legend don't you? This Robin vows to do!",1
< br / > < br / > Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood : Men in Tights. I give this movie an 8 / 10.,1
"It is a visual feast of North African ( mostly Saharan ) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty - five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music ( Mozart and Handel ), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality. That this film was influential in the Quatsi films of Godfrey Reggio is an understatement.",1
How unfair is that? I never fail to appreciate his work in this movie. It goes on and on with strange scenes. < br / > < br / > That's not to say I enjoyed everything.,1
"As one other IMDb reviewer puts it, ""... imagine 2001 : A Space Odyssey in the desert "" and you wouldn't be far off from a brief summarisation of what to expect from this piece of cinema ( I deeply hesitate to use the word "" film "" ). A lecture on philosophical views on creationism, the mythos surrounding humanities existence, the before and after, that was has been, the what is and the what will be. I only hope I can convey it effectively enough. It looks at the natural beauty the Earth was designed for, and concurrently looking at the potential beauty we have within us, more notably shows us our negative contributions to the world in which we live. < br / > < br / > Fata Morgana is a film dealing with the existence of man on our Earth.",1
"It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. But this is just the broadest stroke. I think each side ends up complimenting the other, and it's something that still * seems * like it shouldn't work. Or, maybe it isn't : Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. < br / > < br / > One wonders if the images end up, by the time the second section, Paradise, leading along the words spoken, or if it's the other way around.",1
The imagery in this film only grows more intense and more unusual as the picture continues. I love seeing films that are just in classes of their own. These are also known as mirages.,1
"I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. No other filmmaker is as crazed about the purity of the film - making process and the subsequent lore from such productions as Fitzcarraldo has been forged into cinematic legend. The effect left me to conclude : things are not as they seem. The people populating this inhospitable landscape are ragged, unsmiling and apparent prisoners of the desert.",1
It will change the way you view films. A must see. It's not a documentary either. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film.,1
"Take a gamble? If after this opening, you want to see the movie, you will not be bored.",1
"People and civilization are all part of a broader natural landscape. There are no human characters to speak of. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice - over. Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. < br / > < br / > The movie is in three parts : Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age.",1
"It's a film without an accompanying screenplay. One thing that most viewers will agree on : "" Fata Morgana "" is... different. How baroque. From this subtle theme the film does indeed make sense. For example, in one sequence a man wearing goggles gives us a mini - tutorial on lizards.",1
"Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. If masters can't be expected to keep their place with decorum, than somebody's going to have to do it for them.",1
"Fun story, plain, simple humor. weird. LOVE the painting gag.",1
The writing was of course amazing too. Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war. Like the movie he was freakish. When ever I think of a crazy gone made soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. It has this freakish feel to it. With Brando n this film you don't want to look into his eyes. Most others just display and show you the horrors of war. To me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather.,1
The Dresser'is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them. ). ',1
That's not a joke... that's a sober truth. The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. You could even say the 1980s sitcom'Newhart'borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series.,1
"< br / > < br / > There are two plots intertwined in this movie. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. He played the part to perfection. In this movie Tom is returning home as a college graduate. Ma adapts far more quickly than Pa. Included with the modern conveniences is a television, a very new household item in 1949.",1
We don't even get a hint of where all of those children came from! Pj Give me modern plumbing and I'll gladly become a Kettle. There is a need for this kind of entertainment in our modern world. Humor does NOT require offensive language.,1
"However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. < br / > < br / > Considering that this is a B - movie in the public domain, I certainly did NOT have very high hopes for this little film. So when it seems that there is a real murder, the actors are truly terrified while Carle and his sidekick are convinced it's all a hoax. Full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time.",1
I have this movie on a collection of inexpensive B - movies.,1
"Belden joined independent filmmaker Frank R. Strayer to keep making films, and "" The Ghost Walks "" was one of his best. The three men ask for refugee in an old Mansion which happens to be property of one of Ames'old acquaintances.",1
It just missed being great and somehow fell short. < br / > < br / > That said DO SUGGEST YOU SEE IT.,1
"< br / > < br / > This movie is available for download in the public domain film section of the Internet Archive at archive. < br / > < br / > There is a great scene where Homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him. < br / > < br / > They play off of each other superbly. Mr. Arthur is great in his role of Homer Erskine bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the Broadway producer Herman Wood, played by another great character actor Richard Carle. org. < br / > < br / > For low budget poverty row picture, this film has superb set decoration and great costuming.",1
Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie.,1
"All I can say is.. this is a nice "" chick "" flick! Through their men, their career, the decades that defined them. Well, in certain doses, yes... and this film let out in a bit on... "" how "".",1
Did I imagine this? The rented version did not have this scene in it.,1
Thank you Warner Bros! Glad to finally have this on DVD Well worth the wait!,1
"< br / > < br / > Rich and Famous is catty, campy, witty and wise. George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Watch it and you'll see why.",1
George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation.,1
Frontier scenery is well used as it supports the poetic narrative perfectly.,1
"Overall, this is a very heartwarming and heartfelt western.",1
"To my Santa I added a Winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a Colt revolver to tuck into his waistband. After all, isn't the spirit of the Christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve? It's a sweet folkloric tale of the West that hits every target John Ford takes aim at.",1
"'Cooper was also the producer of "" Mighty Joe Young. """,1
Johnson steals the film with his horse riding skills and it's nice to see an actor doing his own stunts like Ben does in this movie. Most of us kids growing up in the 40's or 50's were western buffs but this was one that had escaped me until seeing on the Movies for Men Channel today. 'If you like films of this genre you can't fail to like this one.,1
"This movie belongs in top ten. That is a tricky and brave thing to do. The pure guts that such a move requires is astounding, and it works beautifully.",1
"The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point. And a great musical score. l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. This confusion leaves a slightly bitter after - taste.",1
"As he said himself,'It couldn't have happened to a nicer fella '. This is film that truly honors America's pioneers and is full of sentiment and feeling. This small John Ford western with no'stars'but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces.",1
"Always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, most poignantly captured in the Joad family of Steinbeck's'The Grapes of Wrath ( 1940 ). < br / > < br / > Ford reportedly considered W By 1950, John Ford had already fully - developed the ideas and motifs that would form the core of his most successful Westerns.",1
"Teams of six horses pulling wagons up steep mountain trails, straining to make the top - this was no simple and easy film. You don't have to be a fan of Westerns to like this one. < br / > < br / > Anyone can enjoy this movie. The look on his face as the horse finally dumps him and gallops away is priceless. I want to hear the whole thing sometime. It must have been risky for the actors, the stunt people and the animals as well.",1
A set of villains to rival any group in any western. The usual ford line about being scared and not showing it. The famous ripped pants of Ward Bond.,1
"I found the Sons of the Pioneers'music a bit schmaltzy at times. It did evoke a nice mood, but seemed to occasionally dominate scenes. He was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film. It was very good but certainly not perfect.",1
"So they hire Travis and Sandy as wagon masters for their trip. I And there is also an atypical ( for Hollywood ) meeting with the Navajo. Ward Bond is his usual marvelous, blustery self.",1
This low - key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest.,1
"The Western can be divided into many sub - genres. Harry Carey Jr. was shaping up into a fine actor like his pa, and this is one of his better early roles. What's more, the absence of real interior scenes means the outdoors could lose its impact over time. < br / > < br / > However, Ford was a real maestro when it came to manipulating space. At the other end you have ones like Wagon Master, where there is barely a homestead on view amid the wilderness.",1
it'certainly not boring. Ford employs a lot of his regulars here.,1
The greatest argument was around Spielberg and whether he is or isn't a great director. But what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can't help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary.,1
"9 / 10. The music is absolutely beautiful. Plus, how can you go wrong with James Arness?",1
"For fans of John Ford, and for fans of western films, this one is a must.",1
"Young Johnson and Carey, Jr. come off real well, but this is Bond's film to shine as he has the best lines. Along the way, they also encounter "" Doctor "" A Locksley Hall and his "" Hoochey Koochey Wagon "" and lend them help.",1
In the Morman train are a number of notable characters.,1
Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. High recommended viewing. One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion.,1
"Worden lived to be 91. Ward Bond even outshines Ben Johnson in this movie. Darwell and Simpson were famous for playing Ma and Pa Joad in Ford's classic version of the John Steinbeck novel "" The Grapes of Wrath. "" He was still making movies when he died. This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails.",1
"My vote is eight. The adventure of the group of Mormons is funny and very entertaining and the songs fit well to the plot despite being dated. < br / > < br / > "" Wagon Master "" is another great western of John Ford. The sequences with the wagon train crossing the desert and the hills are impressive. When the wagon train is near to their destination, the Clegg boys threaten the settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to take an attitude.",1
A must see.,1
"But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. As he And he is still in the field commanding troops. """,1
Ford was struck by his presence and the rest is history. He turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader. < br / > < br / > Ward Bond plays Elder Wiggs leader of the Mormons.,1
"I thought it was incredibly boring. The first time I saw it I was 18 years old and I hadn't seen too many other westerns, and I hated it. It took several years for me to love this picture. ( The other westerns have exterior action AND interior emotion. ) I kept waiting for something to happen. That is why the movie can be called a poem. It quite beautifully places its Mormon pioneers in the context of nature.",1
"It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit...",1
An undefeated trial record ought to get some recognition I would think. < br / > < br / > In fact my favorite scene is Burr and Baio at a sidebar with the judge. Of course Harper has a number of other people who loved her equally as much. Baio was wanting to reopen his case and add a witness and came ready and prepared with precedents. Of course Clohessy has some access to sources that the cops just don't have. Foolish Boy.,1
Or they are trying to tell a predictable story. The filming is worthy of this film stock. < br / > < br / > 2. Strong story. The acting and directing are very powerful.,1
< br / > < br / > See if it you can!,1
"It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine.",1
It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. This is no small feat. Worth every moment!,1
Less is much better in this case.,1
"what he means is that this film is about MADNESS and not war. i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion. i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie. you actually FEEL like your in Vietnam. < br / > < br / > a true classic < br / > < br / > rating : 10 ) martin sheen, and the great Marlon Brando. they just don't make movies like this anymore.",1
I really felt for both characters that Morgan Hallett and Elizabeth Franz portray in this film. !,1
"Just see it. < br / > < br / > Basically, I thought it was totally great.",1
"When you watch it, notice how well it is put together. I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. You are just taken somewhere on a wave of feeling.",1
al. This thought from a great mind is applicable to USA The Movie.,1
"It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. Just see it! Dion Dennis, PhD The structure is non - linear and cyclical.",1
It'over. What do you wake up to? The end of the world and the end of the dream. What do you do next? < br / > < br / > Or maybe you'll crack a beer and forget the whole thing.,1
"Personally, I thought the audio was great. The music through the movie was beautiful.",1
Get angry and hate it. It's not for the empty minds. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better.,1
"I found myself choked up every time i heard his voice. Somehow that made me think a lot. In fact, there's no credits at all in the film. All in all I can't say enough about this DVD.rilliant.",1
"After seeing this film, I am convinced that Coppola is one of masters of light and photography in film history. < br / > < br / >'Apocalypse'is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study. Capt. Another gorgeous scene was when Cpt. It is more'Full Metal Jacket'than'Platoon '. '",1
"It doesn't do any good. I haven't taken much action lately and I wonder how many people have. These days it seems like anyone who speaks out gets jumped and questioned about there "" patriotism "". < br / > < br / > But I'm so sick of bitching about this. The DVD does that too, has references to different times, views and historical points. that are there. The Blue State mentality. Sometimes someone does something out there.",1

"He is middle - aged and confused. Great movie! ! He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter.",1
This movie said so from the beginning. You bet it is.,1
I recommend it. It was an ideal embodi of impermanence. I am an artist and a Buddhist and this film communicated to my senses. At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary.,1
Shakespeare fans would love this! It would not be useful for those studying it at school etc.,1
"For me, the Tempest and its characters ( by which I mean the admirable ones ) are like old friends. So, in the real world, he suffered. It also made me reconsider - why was it that Prospero was cast out of Naples? ).",1
"The closing ( intercut ) scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful of symbols. During the final throes of the Vitnam war, our central character, Capt. Kurtz had eventually come to know this. Kurtz's subtle deal with his executioner, his unilateral'surrender'in return for Willard agreeing ( did he nod? )",1
Have an open mind - and then let this film work it'magic on you.,1
The punk flavour is refreshing and funny.,1
"Must have been one of her first roles. An extremely down - to - earth, well made and acted "" Rodeo "" Western.",1
"Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate.",1
"I'm betting that you'll say it was well worth while. Please give this movie a shot. I personally feel this film was under - rated by most critics. Stephen Lodge "" The Honkers "" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time.",1
"The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. < br / > < br / > Thanks.",1
I really like the Grandmother. I too would love to find this DVD.,1
"Or Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. ask many of my associates. Draw any parallels between this and things you see every day?",1
the show was well written.,1
"The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. This was a great show.",1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much.,1
"Thumbs up to the director. Having seen the uncut version, I thought this film was beautifully made.",1
i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.,1
Congratulations to Star Cinema!! !,1
The filming pretty well took place in the town and surrounding community.,1
"Love In Limbo is my all - time favoirite movie. Aden Young ( Barry McJannet ), and Craig Adams as Ken Riddle.",1
"When Coppola states "" This movie isn't about Vietnam - It is Vietnam "" he's right. I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time. In John Milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen, but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war.",1
I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... !,1
"My Rating : 8 out of 10 Weaknesses : Predictable at points. A group of friends wanting to get laid and become men. < br / > < br / > The general premise is a lot like American Pie. Strengths : Good Aussie cast, easy to relate to, good perve value.",1
"A must see series. This was a great show in the 1960s and has lost nothing, even now in 2007.",1
It is amazing. I admire Shintaro for these qualities. I borrowed the dvds from my local library. We are up to series 3.,1
< br / > < br / > The quality of the DVDs does leave something to be desired. Video perfectionists will not like this one. My score of 8 / 10 takes its age into account.,1
"This was lovely and took some work. While I usually hate dubbing, this time it really made the film. This is definitely possible. Unless you speak the language, try looking for the other version ( provided you understand English ). It was a pretty unappealing collection of art films. < br / > < br / > IMPORTANT UPDATE - - I saw this film again on a DVD entitled "" Cartoon Noir "" on 5 / 09.",1
"It's the artistry that's interesting. Awww, I love this!",1
"If it's in your town, see it. This one short is worth the price of admission. Funny, charming, and touching.",1
i first saw this short when i bought a random DVD of short films a while ago.,1
< br / > < br / > This movie defies categorization. What I like most about'Apocalypse Now'is that it offers no answers or conclusions. My favourite movie of all time.,1
"He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! I just watched The Dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie. Employer is really the wrong term to use, though.",1
I will wait!,1
Certainly worth watching if you are looking for a good courtroom drama. The films opening scenes were extremely intriguing and were enough to sustain early interest in the film.,1
This film blew me away. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome.,1
"Attica! "" Brought back memories. Only a few journalists have told the true story. It was nice to hear it in the movie.",1
I really like this show.,1
I love! She left her parents house and got a job. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. They are best friends.,1
"Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. There's subtle romance which is what I like, personally. But this show is perfect.",1
The only thing I'm not so fond of is surprising bad attitude and reckless actions Rory has suddenly'adopted '. It's one of my favorite seasons so far.,1
"The first half of the film is very good. I know, I know, it's all in the style of Bollywood.",1
It's funny.,1
"Someone needs to give this woman the credit she deserves. Also, for the most part the acting is superb.",1
Watch this show!,1
it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun.,1
ya for Gilmore girls. she is so awesome.,1
wow! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! they're simply wonderful!,1
But it is pretty new if you take a look at the comedy genre. < br / > < br / > So watch it!,1
"This is definitely an excellent show. But it was not. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship. It is also very witty. It is a comedy - drama, which is rare when well done.",1
i wish my mom was like Lorelei. i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i love this show!,1
"i watch it every day! ! i have the episodes from the internet! i just love them!! i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.",1
The people and storylines are not PC but they are real! !,1
! Also they have so many references its amazing how smart it is.,1
< br / > < br / > Almost makes everything worthwhile. And these were just the few seconds or so. I just thought it was the best piece of TV I have seen for a long while. The scripts they use must be enormous.,1
"I am a middle - aged straight male, and this is the ONLY weekly TV show I watch. 4. Thanks to "" Beginnings "", I now have all but 2 episodes on tape, right up through last night ( Ep.",1
This show is my absolute favorite. That is how good it is.,1
Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show of all times. all the character's develop a lot and there's a happy ending for more or less everybody. there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor.,1
The Gilmore Girls makes you feel good so try it. They have their little moments.,1
I was just fascinated with the filmmaking. Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. The two actors are very natural. There is a lot of that. 7 / 10. I wish it had lasted longer. The final bit of the film doesn't work at all. I don't know why.,1
"My wife and I debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of lady in the first part of the film. Oddly, it was 137 minutes long - - slightly longer than the time listed on IMDb. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India. You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family. < br / > < br / > The entire focus of the film then changes completely - - to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras, India. The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it. Last night, I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK ( KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles ).",1
"I wonder if Jane was being entirely satirical in her novel. And oh to be loved by this passionate Henry! Perhaps, she too, could imagine such a Henry.",1
"It certainly is amusing. If you are a Bath fan like myself, you'll love watching this film!",1
"She all but shudders with excitement and anticipation! This time, Catherine dreams she is in Elizabethan times, waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the "" banditi! "" This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way!",1
Make up your own mind and don't let others put you off!,1
I'm sure Jane A would be mildly amused by those reviews. I've just watched this again on the BBC Channel 4.,1
Imagine my suprise at this gothic treat! ( But!,1
"This coupled with Catherines vivid imagination, leads her to fear for her safety. < br / > < br / > The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. He returns to provide a happy ending.",1
I will not go into the story as it is better seen than read. It pays to watch Reader's Digest. Nor does it recognize perils when it is accompanied by the fierce determination to seek what it wants. The foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern Sri Lanka?,1
"This movie is now my current Austen favorite. I've watched it 7 or 8 times so far. The acting, to my mind, is incredible. I love his touch of ( Welsh? ) accent.",1
"Elinor's calm response is stupid too. How did it appear? "" Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. I hate her. The marchioness! < br / > < br / > some of the script is peculiar. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene.",1
I'm a fan of independent film. Highly recommended.,1
"A gritty Australian film, with all the elements for success.",1
If crime / action / comedy is your thing.,1
"< br / > < br / > This movie is one that you should definitely add to your DVD collection and is one that holds up to several viewings quite easily. A lot of reviewers have also compared it to Lock / Stock and Pulp Fiction, while it is the same genre, it is a completely different and original style.",1
Well worth watching.,1
Mani Sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor shoots. In all an amazing movie. Simran has been really good too.,1
to pay of his debt and escape from the gangsters who are on his trail. Brilliant film!,1
"I think that that's just rubbish. 4. This film isn't trying to be Pulp Fiction, the feel and style of each of this excellent films are totally opposite. They portray it very well and very realistically.",1
< br / > < br / > I went for both.,1
Even Heath was pretty good in it. Also hilarious is the quick - edit fate of a random car thief.,1
A sturdy and satisfying little sleeper.,1
A sweaty tattooed bod does become him.,1
"And lets not forget the beautiful Rose Byrne, who plays Ledger'love interest. I found it to be very enjoyable.",1
This film is absolute gold. Love. Watch it.,1
"Many years ago I saw this movie ( on television maybe? ) It did. < br / > < br / > A fascinating aspect to this movie is how it all hangs together. It's'foot in the door'that Jimmy has been waiting for! You just know that a love story will play out between them. Pando has a'job'for Jimmy. It's sort of like a celluloid Moebius strip. In the end, all these'loose ends'tie together beautifully. < br / > < br / > A highlight of the movie is Bryan Brown's character of Pando.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film is well - directed and well - acted. The love and help of friends guides him to a higher plateau. The high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to his blunted senses. "" Two Hands "" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes.",1
Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. Rating my book - 7 ( of 10 ). The setting - up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. It attempted and succeeded in showing us the human side of the baddies such as Bryan Brown.,1
You have to see! It also stars a young Heath Ledger before he got real big in the states.,1
"He was an incredible talent, and his performance in this is one not to be missed. But how wrong I was.",1
"He fits the movie in that he's Australian and looks naive ; but beyond that, he's not the best lead I've ever seen in a movie. The plot follows the story of a young doorman who thinks he'll go on to bigger things after accepting a job from the local kingpin. If you ask me, Bryan Brown gave the best performance here.",1
< br / > < br / > An Australian classic.,1
But this mob tickle your funny bone as well.,1
"< br / > < br / > Enter Jimmy, played by Heath Ledger. He's vicious, but real. So now Jimmy is $ 10, 000 in dept to a major mob boss. Pando, played by Bryan Brown, is a Sydney Mob boss.",1
Here is one of his great movies.,1
And because of that film exactly strikes the audience. Mani Ratnam has amazingly improved. It's a shatter to that small kid. That's a nice view. And her search to find out who she is.,1
"One scene involving a bank robbery will have you in stitches, I guarantee you. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it.",1
"Wanting to get on he falls in with a local "" Big "" Man Pando ( Bryan Brown ). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected. Two Hands "" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue. < br / > < br / > 8 out of 10 < br / > < br / > Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy.",1
I remember catching this film on a C4 screening a year ago and I was completely blown away by the whole thing.,1
"Jessie Lee's father, "" King David "", was the charismatic preacher who co - founded the town. They find a hidden chest of gold on a reconnaissance run and decide to keep it. However, the ambitious, bigoted Colonel Graham ( Zane ) finds out about the gold, and is apparently willing to kill Jessie Lee and company for it. Apparently, Freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the Civil War.",1
"And believe me they weren't. Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy / western movies. I think that alone is commendable.",1
The music was better in Posse. Oh my gosh! It was great! The action was fast paced. Both had its strong points. I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. The fistfights were pretty good also.,1
The music was better in Posse. Both had there strong points. Oh my gosh! It was great! The action was fast paced. I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. The fistfights were pretty good also.,1
"Hopefully, you'll feel same. Does he ever play a good guy? It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie.",1
See this movie.,1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. The dialog was excellent if a bit contemporary! No other actor could have done this role better.,1
And in the end Al Gore does killed Manbearpig!,1
"< br / > < br / > / 10 ManBearPig is a pretty funny episode of South Park. Meanwhile, Cartman finds treasure but wants to keep it all to himself.",1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best.,1
"< br / > < br / > But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. I don't want to give anything away, but it had me rolling on floor.",1
"Cartman crapping out the treasure at end, though predictable, was pretty funny. This was a pretty good episode. ), and he comes within inches of his face.",1
"In fact, he even utilizes some mild profanity and his last words end the film on a positively gut busting final note. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis, and Regis Toomey also co - star. < br / > < br / > 7 / 10 I know it left me with a smile on my face. It's just the thing to save his boss Ralph Norton's ( Conrad Bain ) security company.",1
A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C. H. O. M. P. S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. A cute little kiddie flick.,1
It is also thought provoking. Everyone will see the humor. Movies have different genera's and different purposes. I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. Memorable.,1
"Will CHOMPS save Norton security? CHOMPS is a wonderful, wholesome diversion from world's woes. Costumes, scenery, and production values are good, too.",1
"Can CHOMPS outwit them before its too late. This movie is classic for all ages. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.",1

"mysteriesofcanada. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Nonetheless, I still romanticize about living that kind of life. I wanted to be just like "" Trapper "". com / NWT / madtrapper.",1
The two films have a very similar story line. I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska.,1
"Challenge to be Free "" was one of the first films I saw as a child. The story is as powerful now as it was first time I saw it. It was also one of the first VHS tapes that I owned. Wow.",1
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish! The old man adds to the humor of the story.,1
"On the one hand, I'm happy. When I watch a short like Boy - Next - Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced.",1
"The dialog feels very real. If you get a chance to see this film on iTunes, it's worth the download.",1
"Remember that name. "" And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen.",1
Excellent work! Hello all! Overall the movie is great! And hats off to Mr. Maniratnam.,1
"Yes, it is just that good.",1
"The real competition isn t between < br / > < br / > men and women, but women and women! The colors, the < br / > < br / > cars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement.",1
"Well, they had to find a way for her to lose the baby ( 1959 and all ). Why was this her only movie? < br / > < br / > Sue Carson is delightful Mary Agnes.",1
I loved it!,1
Who knows? The best of everything. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love.,1
Terrific art direction.,1

A very guilty pleasure.,1
Overall the movie is enjoyable. The amount of Brylcream in Stephen Boyd's hair is distracting at times. Their personal lives is the subplot.,1
! What a great movie!!,1
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. If you enjoy films like "" Valley Of The Dolls "" you'll like this one too. Some scenes in this movie reminded me of Melanie Griffith's "" Working Girl "".",1

"She also meets Stephen Boyd, a fellow worker, who has interests in our Hope. He is a distinguished actor that is wasted in this film also. All three ladies have their drama ahead of them. Her presence and her usual strong bitchy self is fun to watch. He's delightfully charming. Crawford almost steals the film.",1
Good afternoon fare. What a grease ball but he found his niche someplace else.,1
"They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. And how about Mark Goddard in a non - speaking role. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. < br / > < br / > I lapped this movie up.",1
"Just don't expect Shakespeare! and is certainly NOT an artistic triumph. And, over time, she quickly moves up the ranks from secretary to editor. This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest.",1
"Well they are younger, aren't they? Isn't that sufficient reason to hate a person? Caroline Bender ( Hope Lange ) is just killing time getting a job. Harassment hadn't been discovered yet, I guess. His character is offensive as hell, but its not played seriously at all. Her real ambition is to marry Eddie and have a baby. '< br / > < br / > Jourdan is a director who mistakenly has an affair with Parker.",1
"Catch it by all means. What's the best for some women is not necessarily the best for all. Half that office would have sexual harassment suits going today. The best of them, Stephen Boyd, is a heavy drinker. Life does sometimes imitate art.",1
I think all the minor characters are wonderful. I love this.,1
Also the songs are just out of this world! ( I could identify with characters in the movie ). They were beautifully and meaningfully picturised.,1
Here we see the male characters and what a bunch they are. The look of the bevy of young beauties in it is also memorable. This film probably has more beautiful women in it than any other. Suzy Parker falls from a fire escape. I love the glossy cinemascope films of the 50's and 60's.,1
A classic late 50's film.,1
"But she exudes glamour and savior faire and her acting is at least adequate. Take a look at the new DVD transfer and you'll know why. Alas, she's not up to where the film sends her : into madness and obsession.",1
I loved it then and still do. Pity scenes were cut prior to release - even at two hours you want more! Cheers.,1
"The only difference, besides the obvious, was that there wasn't much humor in this film. I would even say that it was tragic. I feel very strongly that this film was just like Waiting to Exhale with white females in the 1950's.",1
Great Plot. High recommended.,1
"Yes, I rented it after reading others'comments. < br / > < br / > This movie is certainly worth your looking at.",1
"Also, the acting and visual effects are well done.",1
"Full of funny gags and loaded with laughs, this is a great cartoon.",1

Who nowadays asks for a highball?,1
A few bodies fall along the way. Watch it.,1
"It's a non - Charteris story too, bristling with murders and good clean fun. Well worth watching for all of us who like this kind of thing, but if Val Kilmer's version is your yardstick then don't bother. George Sanders playing the Saint for the penultimate time does a good job out of a good script - with the usual good RKO cast around.",1
I wanted to get inside his mind. I wanted to see this Bruce Haack guy!! I wanted to learn more about Bruce!,1
This movie is brilliant! Beautiful music by A. R. Rahman. WOW!,1
"I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. invention of the Peopleodian, where Bruce could actually play music by touching people. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.",1
"This naughty musical is way above similar of others that were released at same time. < br / > < br / > The sex is just icing on the cake, both version satisfy.",1
I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. Me and my friends really enjoy her.,1
"She is shocked, but is a kind person who It is time for us all recognise that neither the R rated ( soft porn? ) available on DVD were in any way pornographic.",1

8 / 10 This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is truly original. It's the kind of thing you'd show your kids - if it weren't for the graphic sex. Oh - and some of the musical numbers are downright hilarious.,1
"Miss DeBell has a pleasant singing voice as she trills about wanting to be free. Subversive Video, to their credit, has released two versions, X and XXX in the same package. While driving the tourist laden city streets, we saw a movie marquee advertising "" ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX.

"". besides, the music is really good and i like musicals.",1
This is an incredible movie that begins slowly. It leads you along in thinking of it as a typical maudlin family drama.,1
Pretty much a delight throughout. What can you possibly say?,1
If you're an open minded adult with a taste for somethingpicy I can heartily recommend this little film as a nice diversion. Its an naughty little tale for adults. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs.,1
The logic and humor were definitely accounted for. I can see this being a cult film. < br / > < br / > Kristine DeBell appears as Alice.,1
"Fabulous! There is a real plot to it and how many x - rated movies can boast that these days? I mean, it is an x - rated musical based on an actual book! This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic.",1
"City with some friends. She is young and ( ohhh! ) It's the original uncut version and, this time, I really had a ball!",1

It was a big summary of the first series of Dads Army. Most of these came in the 1970's.,1
One more classic performance by Maniratnam and his team.,1
Not in this case!,1
"Good episode to watch is "" No Spring for Fraz "" You'll not be disappointed. Watch a series or two of the show first before you watch this.",1
"So where does this leave us, the viewers? I can't make up my mind if that'a positive or a negative, though.",1
"This was possibly because it had an unusually large number of well - developed characters and derived most of its humour from the interactions between them. The period was, however, emphatically not a golden age of British film comedy, and what worked well on television rarely transferred successfully to the big screen. ( About the only other one I can think of was "" Porridge "" ).",1
"Some of which work better than others for example the scene where a high ranking army officer floats down a river is a memorable, surreal moment. Like most transfers of television shows, this movie suffers from an absence of plot and is more a collection of sketches.",1
Not to be missed! 8.,1
Also comments referring to propaganda were also way off the mark.,1
"With the Box I was pleasantly surprised. Decent acting, great creepy visuals, and looming atmosphere add to the slow chilling ride. It's tone is completely different, as are the messages and intents of this film.",1
"NOT A Hollywood ENDING! Overall good flick. Diaz was good, but was there a need for the country accent? Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it. Then the movie takes a dive into the unusual. Its intense.",1
"Which of course means plenty of material for an after - show discussion. < br / > < br / > Metaphorically, the box refers to how us humans tend to subconsciously hole ourselves into situations or things in everyday life, and how our enclosed thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective, seldom out of the box.

"< br / > < br / > RATING : Easily a 9 / 10. Personally I don't think this is a bad thing, but many will. I have never had an experience like watching this movie. This movie is deep, it has meaning.",1
There isn't too much more to say without ruining the film for you. Check it out. One day a mysterious box appears with a red button.,1
"In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential. The twists are numerous, but easy to follow if not to predict. It isn't always sure what it wants to be. Forget about Donnie Darko.",1
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7. 5 ) read some of the dozens of 1 - star "" hated it "" reviews that are rife with misspellings, lack of punctuation and capitalization, and juvenile criticisms.

Do consider the quality and source of the reviews before taking them to heart.",1
"See, that's why I liked it so much - it promotes discussion! So why did I give this movie a generous seven stars? The car that you drove to work is a box, on wheels. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, "" Donnie Darko "" and "" Southland Tales, "" you know that's gotta mean something. Quite frankly, it's the ONLY way - only through Kelly's unique style could this story be told the way it's intended. I'm not gonna lie. I for one could only comprehend roughly 40 % of what I saw on - screen, and even then it can only be called interpretation.",1
"We got to see, Robin always being'on ', no matter what. Still, thought it was great. I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. We never saw the head of ABC. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. ).",1
"It was uncanny how well he did. Its another to do it for a whole TV movie. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes. So for that, I give HIM a 10.",1
"He acts it up, perfectly. It almost made me cry watching him.",1
"This performance won her a National award. I think his Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child. I am intrigued by the connection Mani Ratnam has with terrorism, love and obsessions. AR Rahman's music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in film.",1
"Which brings me to this movie. Nanoo, nanoo! Not really, but Robin certainly was. Was the original show great? ).",1
Do yourself a favor and demand this set on DVD! My tapes are old and I crave this trilogy on DVD.,1
"The costumes, filming, sets and music are all first - rate as well.",1
I really enjoyed North and South very much. I really liked the chemistry between the two men and was really interested to see if their friendship could survive the war. The war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic to me. I think it is one of the best and most lavish television series I have ever seen.,1
"Professional copies are hard to find, however, when it's on DVD, it's MINE!! !",1
"Patrick Swazy at his best,.",1

"This is what great film is all about! The music fit the movie perfectly and after the < br / > < br / > credits rolled, I wanted to watch again... so I did.",1
"Garber's bitchy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil Ashton is fun to watch on screen.",1
"I though wow this looks exciting. To most people book three was a big disappointment as far as I know. Well since I have seen book one on DVD, I must say that until now it is the best of the entire 3 books.",1
"The clothes the women wore were GORGEOUS! Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol.",1
"The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.",1
What a President! Brothers fighting brothers.,1
"Don't miss it. Have you ever seen anyone looking like Lincoln? I'm so glad that finally is available on DVD in Spain. The crafted costumes, the jaw dropping locations, everything.",1
"Yet, the most famous film about the north - south clash is still, I suppose, GONE WITH THE WIND ( 1938 ). In spite of that, friendship unites them. Why? < br / > < br / > Firstly, the entire story is deeply rooted in historical reality. Unfortunately, fewer people know the magnificent TV series based on John Jakes'novel, "" North and South.

Several cameos by major stars of past eras. A lap rug and a cat would optional.,1
"The movie had an even keel never straying from Rachel. She epitomized strength, will power, confidence and resolve. Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through.",1
I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The costumes and sets were gorgeous! Part III is a disappointment.,1
I love how this miniseries makes me feel engaged in it'drama. It makes me happy.,1
Slave issues and civil war has always fascinated me ( a 25 year old Finn ). Gosh...,1

"< br / > < br / > It's a fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy from author John Jakes.

This aspect of the story also uncovers a romantic tale that is set to turbulent backdrop of the American Civil War. < br / > < br / > "" North & South "" is a wonderful historic timeline and as I have grown older ( and wiser! ) However, it's Kirstie Alley",1
"this is the reason why this ranks as one of his best movies. ! their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie. another flaw is, surprisingly enough, the brilliant songs. they again seem forced and stand out, not gelling with the rest of script.",1
I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. One of the best! I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome.,1
"As always, thanks Rod, for all that you taught us... even now. There will be some tears, but comfort as well.",1

When he arrives, he finds the wife weeping and unresponsive to his conversation. Because the raccoon is a predominantly nocturnal animal hunt is by moonlight. Rip sounds displeasure. There is no living nightmare, no sudden changes of setting. The man jumps in to help his dog.",1
Good. A warmly sentimental tale from the author of The Waltons. I see a subtle environmental message here.,1

"it'a great story of morality, hidden truth and compromise. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy.",1
"While she is playing, Thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that "" you are not our daughter "" and the response is predictable. Human rights groups have said that, as a result of the war, more than one million people have been displaced, homeless or living in camps.",1
"What is not believable is Truth and Reconciliation process - - except that it actually happened. "" The torture scenes are shown in brief flashes but they are vivid and believable. She does a passable job.",1
"Please see this ; you'll understand why when you do. Cheers, Ho The acting by the leads were mind - blowing and the script was incredible. Emotive ; powerful ; very moving ; horrific and heart - breaking. I was busting for the loo ; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in.",1
And she didn't prove me wrong in this movie. It seems to me to hit the high - rating button on all counts. The whole movie ran almost like a documentary. < br / > < br / > Why can't a movie like this ever get nominated for an International award.,1
"What happened to its release in theatres? < br / > < br / > This picture deserves a wider audience than it seems to be getting. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down.",1
"I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product. < br / > < br / > I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa (? ) The closing sequence where the "" truth "" comes out was the strong finish every film hopes for.",1
"What's happening in South Africa should guide us all. I found it credible, moving and at times upsetting. There were no outstanding acting performances but this added to the strength of the narrative.",1

I truly recommend this film if you like to laugh.,1
A positive guy. He is great in this movie. !,1
"Overall, the acting is excellent.",1
"Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non - stop to Berlin.",1
There aren't much left when it arrives.,1
"Pat and Alex'defense claims that Meg enjoyed and asked for it. If not, give it a try because it's a very good and strong drama. < br / > < br / > The raping scene wasn't ( in my opinion ) a well created scene. The only thing for sure is that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of a crime. That's why it looks sometimes dull and becomes boring almost near the end.",1
"The actors all do okay jobs with what is given to them and there's not really anything to complain about it. The standout feature in the movie is of course Carla Gugino who bares it all in this movie. it's very sexual and very graphic at times. She is actually more nude in this movie than she is in "" Sin City "".",1
"< br / > < br / > The gifted cast rings true. They are good. The rape is brutal not sexual. It is a "" should see "". It is not. Carla Gugino and Rya Kihlstedt are incredible.",1
"A PECK ON THE CHEEK inhabits similar territory, but is perhaps more ambitious in ground it covers. It's an emotionally complex film, with characters that are somewhat idealised but still behave in a very human way. Sri Lanka... not a country I've ever given much thought to, I have to admit. She's a princess and a monster, always getting into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her for long. ).",1
Inspired and inspiring. Still as poetic and powerful as when I first saw it over 17 years ago. I watch the 3 boxed sets every autumn for their'mellow fruitfulness '. Why can't British or US TV PRODUCE SUCH MASTERPIECES?,1
"I can't wait to see number 3 now. I'm interested in Stefan being an autobiographical character because aside from Helga he is probably the least likable of friends. Undoubtledly a film of this scope raises lots of questions, like why are there some narrative differences between the 60's Hermann in'Heimat'and Hermann in this film?",1
"< br / > < br / > Actually, it's not really a sequel. In 1984, Edgar Reitz surprised film - lovers all over the world with his epic opus Heimat : A Chronicle of Germany. It's more of a "" midquel "", as it covers events that took place between the ninth and eleventh episode of the first Heimat cycle.",1
!,1
Edgar Reitz displays a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and longings. A masterpiece and a revelation.,1
"The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The sequel, Heimat 3, is currently being filmed in Germany.",1

Great fun for an evening on the sofa.,1
"Men will also enjoy this film, which presents various masculine issues in a different way than most other mid - sixties films from the USA or even Australia. The photography is notably confident. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love "" Oz "". This film is worth seeing for Bruce Spence's performance alone. That similarity suggests that "" Oz "" was far ahead of its time. 7 / 10 for some minor continuity problems.",1
Much like Australia in the 1970s this film has a certain naive charm. < br / > < br / > The performances range from flinchingly amateur to finely nuanced brilliance. Wow! While not as frivolous or well constructed as RHPS it's hard not to have fun with Oz.,1
Good fun. The classic tale of the wizard of oz with a decidedly cornball 70 ` s australian twist.,1

This is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you. Certainly one not to be missed!,1

But without reservation I can heartily recommend this film to anyone ; one of the very best I have ever seen.,1
This is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you. Certainly one not to be missed!,1
The two friends eventually both fall in love with the same woman. The acting is absolutely spot on! They eventually leave the home to live in a flat in Carrigmore by themselves. ).,1

Very well done.,1
This film is everything a great film should be.,1
< br / > < br / > Out Of 10 ''Meet Sherri.. for an evening of Pleasure and Terror!'' The storyline was good but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more views. The acting was okay but some of the acting was robotic.,1
"Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. To anyone who doesn't know, they might think he really has CB. He appears in almost every scene, and acts up an absolute storm. Highly recommended.",1
What a superb film! Steven Robertson's performance / portrayal blows Dustin Hoffmann's right out of the water - and he deserves recognition as such! !,1

I was still only watching things that ended happy. I still wouldn't go near it until I had cerebral palsy as a vocab word. But watch the movie it's worth it.,1
"< br / > < br / > Again amazing film! ! This film was amazing, it was extremely funny and moving.",1
"Does anybody know whatever happened to Bill Roy, by the way? This film is actually scary! Am I saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch "" Nurse Sherri ""? Geoffrey Land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend. ( And what an ending! No, of course not. Nurse Sherri "" was a Poverty Row production, and it shows at times ( sets, special effects, etc. ).",1
"But the real star for me is Steven Robertson. Rory, who already had a bad name with the "" judges "", was to be his interpreter. Thus starts off a friendship that relies mainly on ( ironically enough ) communication. Probably someone. But that isn't a bad thing. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. < br / > < br / > Excellent.",1
"But the revelation is Stephen Robertson as Michael. Go see it. And his eyes... my God, he can rip you apart with them.",1
I cannot believe this is his first real film. You owe it to yourself to check this film out. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well.,1
"< br / > < br / > This film is one of the gems of the year! So convincing are their characters that you truly do believe that they are disabled. The pair really seem close friends, and as their tale unfolds you care completely for them.",1
"This movie felt so real. James McAvoy is perfect as Rory O'Shea, who has Duchene's muscular dystrophy. The acting is phenomenal! < br / > < br / > The story is great. I know they exist because I'm one of them.",1
This is more like Hitchcock meets Italian thriller!,1
"Years later, the young girl from the prologue is an adult woman bound to a wheelchair. Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror! What is it about ordinary child dolls that make them so creepy? She Joanna falls in love with her personal coach and they get married right away. In the meantime, good luck tracking this baby down! The acting is quite competent, with David Warbeck ( "" The Beyond "", "" The Black Cat "" ) in a glorious greedy villain role.",1
High recommended for fans of Italian cinema!,1
"A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters. The plot can be a little uneven at times, but generally action is very good. The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums.",1
"Seeing Ali G as a bumbling idiot, his plan backfires.",1
You'd think so by some of the reviews. 7 out of 10. What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film? And Nurse Sherri begins to change.,1
6. < br / > < br / > if you are a fan then watch it! bora does make a cameo appearance.,1
Keep it real!,1
"But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw. So the basic point of all show was lost.",1
he is a genius.,1
"However, refinement is the key word here. < br / > < br / > Ali G is a better television programme.rat is a better film. The script is enjoyable to an extent, and there are no issues as far as acting goes.",1
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. So I say BIG UPS to Ali G, and if it's not your thing, don't whine BATTY BOY!",1
I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. I have nothing to compare it to. My only disappointment was when it was over.,1
It really depends on the type of Nintendo fan you are. So try out yourself.,1
"Imperfect but likable, good film for a rainy day. < br / > < br / > 8 out of 10. But considering it was a made - for - TV movie, that's to be expected. It's not preachy, it's simply good.",1
< br / > < br / > They iz wicked!,1
You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time.,1
"Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh - a - second fun fest - just like on the small screen. Well, the ending was funny, but also botched and failed - none of it made sense. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either.",1
And this movie is good!,1
"Absolutely Brilliant. When I was watching it, I was in a hysterical fit.",1
Definite Vote Ali G and keep it real.,1
!,1
It very realistic and atmospheric.,1
It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen. ).,1
Most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years. < br / > < br / > And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010.,1
I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it. 9 / 10.,1
There's also a good amount of suspense. I recommend seeing it now that it's being released on DVD in late July. And the killers feel more threatening than in Friday.,1
"The movie moves along at a great pace. Yet, that version is STILL superior to the one with the deluxe DVD treatment. Fiedel complained of this and made it clear that the filler music was not his. The picture and sound quality of the film on that edition was a nightmare in itself.",1
I honestly can't spoil it - you just have to watch it for yourself. A must see if you like underrated horror films. The DVD includes commentary by Lieberman.,1
Just Before dawn is an excellent horror movie.,1
"The ending is a bit weird, but I won't tell you anything more about it. And you know what? It's just magic! It was enjoyable to watch enough not to care. Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. It's one of the best experiences I had watching a slasher movie.",1
"Oh yeah - George Kennedy is here too and when is that not a good thing? However, "" JBD "" delivers considerably more.",1
"I firmly recommend this one to serious horror fans. The characters are about par for this kind of movie, though more sympathetic than some, and the bad guy memorably freaky. Don't expect gore, do expect a creepy backwoods tale with several awesome moments and a great dreamlike ambiance.",1
especially the good old chills. ! < br / > < br / > buy this movie!,1
And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! which makes a extremely well made slasher! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!,1
"See it! The acting is top notch. For the first time viewer, it may be a little shocking. The end scene is a bit off kilter. Even non - slasher fans will find something to like about it.",1
"I really enjoyed it. < br / > < br / > 8 out of 10, kids. It's got that creepiness to it.",1
( WARNING : SPOILERS! ),1
"It's not particularly violent, but there's still a mean - streak evident even if some of it happens of screen. Cinematographers Dean M. and Joel King do a striking job too. There's a likable bunch of performances ; Deborah Benson makes for a strong, dashing heroine. At times the pacing can become a stop - and - go affair. The mountainous woods, young happy campers, a warning by a park ranger and a lurking figure.",1
"Shortly after, they brutally encounter an inbred family of which the twin sons have murderous tendencies. advise to return back to civilization. No irritating stereotypes for which you don't feel sympathy anyway, like slutty girls or football jocks. All five main characters are surprisingly likable and convincing! In case the film seems slow and uneventful, this is only because Lieberman takes his time to introduce the dark woods and eerie mountains as extra characters in his film. Well, sadly, I can't help but feeling a little bit disappointed after my much, much, MUCH - anticipated viewing of "" Just Before Dawn "". But actually I'm beginning to think that Lieberman isn't the one to blame for this, but WE gorehounds are! The woods are deserted and, naturally, the campers ignore forest ranger Roy's ( George Kennedy! )",1
"My personal rating : 10 out of 10. All actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable. P. S This one is even more chill than "" Halloween "".",1
"Don't miss this film, there is plenty of everything. Roy McLean warns these young people that where they are going is no area for camping and they should turn back.",1
"It's a shame that we don't get movies like this any longer, and if we do, it's usually some boring terrible film. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway. One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones.",1
I'm not kidding. It'll be worth it! 9 Action : 10. But please try this game!,1
"29 Sept 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation of horror flicks. The youngsters come rolling into the picture in a snappy Winnebago, Blondie's'Heart of Glass'pounding on the soundtrack, and before you can say "" Texas Chainsaw Massacre! "" Needless to say, things go downhill from here. they've clobbered an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first taste of aggro from the heavy - set maniac responsible for the opening catastrophes.",1
"Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh. The film has genuine moments of suspense and tension, and actually refrains from graphic gore, save for one killing right at the beginning. One of the most clever touches is the final dispatching of the killer, which I'd never seen before in a horror film and probably won't see again. < br / > < br / > "" Just Before Dawn "" is noticeably more ambitious, "" arty "", and intelligent than some slasher films.",1
"). < br / > < br / > The hermetic family the teens come across in the woods, then, is eventually revealed to be hiding a skeleton in their closet. George Kennedy appears as a sympathetic Ranger ; though he doesn't have a lot to do, his characterization is decidedly enhanced by making him a lover of plant and animal life.",1
The inbred twins are truly frightening and remorseless killers. 10 out of 10 - what else? A must - see for slasher fans.,1
This film makes even the open wilderness seem frighteningly claustrophobic. See it! However they are not alone in the wild. Definitely well worth seeking out for slasher fans and horror buffs alike.,1
Messiah was compulsive viewing from start to finish.,1
Okay it ` s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it ` s still compelling.,1
"Recommended. Not quite enough'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated.",1
9. mario fans : the game you've been waiting for. beautiful graphical design as well.,1
Now regarding this mini - series. The primary story was kept near perfectly intact. Some of the other events in the book are changed to be viewer friendly.,1
You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule. What can I say? < br / > < br / > Rated'15'by BBFC for moderate violence and strong horror.,1
The story follows DCI Metcalfe trying to solve a case of grisly murders being taken out across London.,1
Welllll... it kind of sort of worked.,1
"Some GET it, others DO NOT, interesting. I saw this movie in the early 1990's when it had been out on VHS for a little while. This is how it affected and affects me.",1
( The Buck Henry segment alone is worth the price of admission ). < br / > < br > Definitely worth watching. You don't need to be an opera lover to watch this film.,1
"It is the mood that counts. We could have used more Beverly Sills. For the most part they succeed wonderfully. With all these operas, who is going to like them all.",1
"< br / > < br / > Fran Roddam - - Richard Wagner. < br / > < br / > Julien Temple - - Verdi. Filled with gratuitous female nudity. A yawner. Worth seeing even if you don't like opera. < br / > < br / > Charles Sturridge - - Verdi. Short, lush and romantic. Russell is great. ).",1
"I am a classical music lover, and I liked this film.",1
"It's simply amazing. Not all of it, but even the ones that aren't orchestrated still sound very nice. ! < br / > < br / > MUSIC : Simply amazing, the music in this game is orchestrated. * Wow... best game since Super Mario 64.",1
"7 / 10. It also has a great self - referencing joke about omnibus films themselves. The final scene is very weak. Bravo, Jean - Luc! The photography is unaccomplished. The segment is dreamlike and beautiful.",1
"Now this is not to say this is a bad film - - it certainly isn't. Also, there just wasn't much life in the film until it was nearly complete. It just didn't rise to the level of being unforgettable or a film I strongly recommend you see. It's nice to see it ended on high note.",1
Not bad for an early talkie film. Also watch for a new kind of safe that doesn't need a combination. Clever ending.,1
"John's older brother Lionel Barrymore is Guerchard, the Javert - like Surete detective sworn to catch Lupin. Arsène Lupin "" is quite enjoyable, with MGM's usual high production standards and Jack Conway's usual briskly efficient direction. ( Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer. ) Tully Marshall has a good scene as one of Barrymore's victims.",1
"John Miljan provides a sturdy presence in his small role as the police prefect. Helped by a generous script, the outcome is pretty much a draw, with the viewer the clear winner. Alike and yet so different, they are the perfect counterpoint to each other.",1
"< br / > < br / > Not a classic, but still funny. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat at Butlins.",1
"A number of sexy girls occupied these coats too, most notably Nikki Kelly's'Sylvia'and statuesque Rikki Howard's'Betty '. We never saw Joe Maplin, the owner. He communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical missives, which poor Jeffrey was forced to 'Hi - De - Hi! I think it must have been the title that put me off. '.",1

You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment. Mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are big, many planets are similar to classic Mario environments.",1
"So, a pretty fun Spaghetti Western, that doesn't take itself too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Spaghetti Westerns.",1
The performances are extremely well tailored and form a striking rapport.,1
"Later, Montero catches up with Pajondo at the Rio Grande. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Three tough - looking gunfighters ride into a town.",1

"! - Oh, and thanks IMDb for your invaluable / great work!!",1
"It makes all the right moves. < br / > < br / > The film is fast paced, tough and brutal. The killers are dark with real menace. The teens are real ala Larry Clark. It could well be.",1
"Its quality almost is of TV movie but of the good ones. Some to the drug traffic, or the fight is no reference either farmer and worker, or wing guerrilla and to the kidnapping political.",1
"It is a crime comedy of the same ilk as Snatch etc, and it manages to nicely balance elements of suspense with comedy. Bluff'has been showing for a good few months at movie theatres in Bogota, and today I finally got round to seeing it. I didn't really know what to expect at all, but was very happily surprised. And all in a tightly packaged 90 minutes. '",1
Bluff I really think this movie is very good. < br / > < br / > Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie.,1
"It kind of reminded me of films likenatch, and others of the sort. And amazingly I found it really original.",1
An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export!,1
Only worth seeing on cable.,1
"And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. And when he arrives at night to the local train station, there is no carriage, so off he sets out on foot to the estate. Are we uneasy? Later, does love emerge between Walter and Laura?",1
A wonderful thriller. Right from the start it drew me in. I didnt know what to expect.,1
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin?,1
"What this movie is, is a strong drama / thriller. I watched this not expecting too much from it. I very good solid 7 out of 10.",1
< br / > < br / > Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying. Every shot is done beautifully. An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it. 10 / 10 stars.,1
The best nature series we have ever seen.,1
"a predator? Anyway, it's remarkable. And... wouah!",1
This is definitely worth peoples money!,1
just like life itself. the best parts are of course the action scenes and chases.,1

"< br / > < br / > 2001 had some great tv shows to our screen. But, in contrast to this documentary gem, they make them pretty lame!",1
"One of the movies I would like to buy and keep it in my collection... for ever! A true fighter in there, or what!",1
Everything about the movie was perfect. Some stories do have happy endings. They were survivors. The character had many shades.,1

So what?,1
"John Hurt is great and Penelope Cruz isn't bad, as you might expect. This could be used as an advert for tourism in the Mediterranean.",1
"< br / > < br / > The main story is, although very differently structured, as in the original drama. < br / > < br / > Parodies were not a new experiment for Chaplin. A BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is a somewhat odd Chaplin - film, very different, but includes good material nonetheless.",1
"This child, Ruben Santiago - Hudson wrote the screenplay. It's cinema very at its best.",1
Capt.,1
My wife and I really liked the film. And so do the other principle characters.,1
! The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing!,1
"The true test of a supporting actor / actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the personage in question, and in this case, it would most certainly not be... not even close. Rating = 3. But there were saving graces. - - ) musical ability. < br / > < br / > Entertainment value but for the aformentioned plus factors which do help raise the bar. Nicely, the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses, but it´s teeth - gnashing early on.",1
"John Hurt, Pelagia's father, also acted great. He reminded me a greek in many of his reactions.",1
"John Hurt was great as usual. However, I did learn something.",1
"Again, Nicolas Cage did not disappoint. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island.",1
"And it was GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!! You should see!",1
"8 / 10. The characters are honest, brave, earnest, sympathetic, and likeable. < br / > < br / > The story is tender, and the message is uplifting. In a word, they have "" character. "" It's a nice little film. That is not so.",1
"Perfect in every way, highly recommended. How wrong can you be!",1
"Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece.",1
"I am glad nobody ever tried. Here's a well - made war story, nicely shot and well - acted. < br / > < br / > The movie'Captain Corelli's Mandolin ', however, is worth seeing. Of course, this makes it a novel about love.",1
I asked myself that same question while watching this movie. Once again John Madden has given us a magnificent film.,1
"I would like to see this again to follow all side plots. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.",1
"Once Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them. The portrayal of Italian troops also struck me as believable.",1
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. And the fine Greco - Italian supporting cast bring de Berniere's sundrenched world of Cepholonia dazzlingly alive.,1
"Being Of Cephallonian descent, I was happily surprised when watching the movie.",1
"There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment. < br / > < br / > There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic. By the time we reach the post war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal. Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on features.",1
"Maurizo Centini's fairly polished cinematography likewise does the trick. Moreover, Marcello Giombini's funky, throbbing tribal score hits the groovy spot. A satisfyingly seamy chunk of slimy swill.",1
10 Stars for fans of tastelessleaze. The female lead has sex with everybody on the plantation.,1
"Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint. It shows on screen. The trouble with'Puckoon'is that, like Milligan's other books, they simply don't work on the big screen. 'Puckoon'is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot.",1
Enjoyed it immensely.,1
"He brings an innocence to the part, especially in his to - camera pieces ( which is normally where he interacts with the voiceover of Richard Attenborough, playing supposedly the writer / director of the film ). < br / > < br / > It was inspired work to cast the Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes to play the part of Madigan.",1
"Well worth the watch. If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny. It's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that actually works.",1
Its perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or a late night viewing when one is nostalgic for the late late show.,1
"Everyone heads off to Walters newly purchased mansion on Long Island to await the assassin. They decide he must die that very night. Yoganda ( C. Henry Gordon ) a Hindu mystic ( which movies of that time were loaded with ) says "" Evil is on the way. "" "".",1

"It's the man's first movie, for cryin'out - loud! It's a nice love story, funny at times and sad at others. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. On stage. My vote is a 7. Sure, maybe that was the intention, but that's been done. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. But overall, it was a good one, worth watching.",1
"A great movie, I strongly recommend. Unfortunately. It seems that he didn't capture or understand the concept Falcão has created.",1
Also I can't recall such a powerful performance like Gustavo Falcão '. You can realize that he'll move mountains and do anything for this love. Years ago I read the book'A Máquina'( The machine ).,1
"And the way he does it is unbelievable. I rented this movie, but I wasn't too sure what to expect of it. It's just fun, and it makes you feel good.",1

"But it has a lot more. I loved the ending. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale. We women don't want illusions in life, we want reality.",1
"Go see. The accompanying music is soothing and transporting, a balm to the soul.",1
A labor of love. I can't wait for commercial release of this movie. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. The casting is as perfect as one can get.,1
The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film.,1
One major negative for this viewer : a Keystone Kops chase near the film's conclusion as Hari flees mobsters bent on collecting a gambling debt. But the closing scenes where Isa and Hari bid farewell are poignant and unforgettable.,1
See it! East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth.,1
"Hari Om is about an impossible love between a French tourist and the auto - rickshaw driver who agrees to take her to a rendezvous with her indifferent boyfriend. He speaks of honesty and purity as the wellsprings of his approach, and the earnestness of his desire to communicate something authentic to the audience is clear. < br / > < br / > In an interview, Raaz proves to be quite untouched by his success, responding rather carefully and pensively to questions.",1
"they nailed it! "" In a word... magical. VERY bittersweet but you certainly leave the theater feeling fulfilled. But Vijay Raaz... Camille Natta is absolutely gorgeous. Very real, very raw. I find myself constantly coming back to him - because he is what MAKES this movie.",1
"Autorickshaws honking, traffic and a whole lot of chaos. But how and where he learnt to speak English even that fluently, is the question! Or so I thought Hari Om started with chaos and noise. < br / > < br / > Once inside the theater, I found that the SAIFF organizers only presented disaster. He's a winner all the way. The snow and the crowds outside the theater only set my anxiety rising.",1
"The characters are a little broadly drawn but the acting was very good. It's like taking a trip to India.... colorful, magical, thought provoking. Great soundtrack too!",1
"It is a delightful, happy film. And basically I just loved the movie. ! And the girl ( forget the name ) was great too. I loved it! They were all great! He was the highlight of the movie.",1
"Fortunately for us, Hari Om's companion is a young and beautiful French woman in search of a journey. Don't let film pass you by! """,1
"I related to everything, and savored every moment. It is so easy to identify with each of situations portrayed.",1
"< br / > < br / > "" Watch it ""! HARI OM shows the audience what freedom actually means. Have you ever wondered what its like to feel FREE?",1
"< br / > < br / > What made the night most memorable was having the director, executive producer, main editor and even the mother of Ms. Natta present at the screening.",1
Look at how many people love I Dream Jeannie. If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Does every film have to be perfect? Is it perfect? I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well.,1
"I loved. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better. If you're not open - minded you won't get it.",1
It's a charm!,1
Check it out.,1

"As it opened and revealed the cast, we thought, well how bad can it be?",1

Anyone know if it is out on video yet? Would love to see it again.,1
Keep an open mind. wonder.,1

That is the most treasurable love from the light of soul. I had almost forgot what the passion feel like.,1
This is exactly what makes it a Great movie. your loss.,1

It is at times terribly moving. Julie Andrews had me intitches. Anyone who misinterprets Dirk's angry outburst has it wrong.,1
"To me it's the best film he ever made. I do think that every character is plausible. Bates is a miracle, she is perfect, just like a role. I even understand Max ( the husband ), he is bored with his life, he's got a midlife crisis.",1
"I went out and bought the DVD. It's quirky, you know? Man, I had my doubts. This is a very winsome, fun movie.",1
The funeral scene is hysterical! Grace is one of Kathy Bates'best roles. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene.,1
Not to missed.,1
< br / > < br / > If only Hollywood would learn from Independent film makers! But it was worth it. And she can sing too! Maybe we would go back to real movies.,1
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before.,1
"With a broken heart, she decides to fly to England to Victor Fox's funeral. Indeed, this movie is an excellent entertainment. < br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) :'Amor a Toda Prova'('Love to the Proof') My vote is eight. There, she realizes that he was gay, and becomes friend of his former mate Dirk Simpson ( Rupert Everett ). They fly back to Chicago, trying to find the killer.",1
He is tall! WONDERFUL! I am a huge Rupert Everett fan.,1
"Dan Aykroyd also has nothing to do. < br / > < br / > The English actors are good. We see him at the beginning and at the end of the film and his Max doesn't make sense. Unconditional Love "" starts with great promise. It appears the artistic team behind the movie had great hopes for it to play differently. She's is brash and tells it as she sees it.",1
5 out of 5.,1
"But a great cast! It is test. The other 50 % of you will probably want to change the channel after 20 minutes, but you HAVE TO KEEP WATCHING.",1
I like to be surprised.,1
I am biased I suppose. There she meets his three surviving uppity sisters. It makes you cry. She has a very nice voice.,1
"Well, not this time. Well, they do in this movie.",1
"How responsible was he then? Yes, it's a good flick, but he got what was coming to him. < br / > < br / > I disagree.",1
She seems to be exactly like her character. She smokes and drinks. Jenny Lewis is the standout.,1
"< br / > < br / > The age difference between Jenny and Rob was good too, because they were similar in age.",1
"None of the characters was portrayed at an extreme - either all - good or all - bad - and all rang true. Other stories seem to need to provide the "" everyone lived happily ever - after "" close.",1
Billy is played by Rob Este who couldn't have looked better.,1
"The end leaves you unsatisfied and disappointed. A perfect stranger. The acting is flawless. Simple. The catch? Good, but not great. The ending is also overly dramatic, for a Hitchcock film.",1
"The crux of the story revolves around Nanny's relationship with young Ruben ( beautifully played by Marcus Franklin ), a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so Nanny took him in. Merkeson is nothing short of magnificent, in performance that earned her a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award. LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining, engrossing, emotionally - charged HBO - TV movie based on the childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago - Hudson ( who also appears in a small role ).",1
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see.,1
It's 3 : 30am. < br / > < br / > I give it 10.,1
""" Caribe "" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects.",1
< br / > < br / > It is so different and refreshing it almost defies categorisation. Oh my!,1
The film accurately depicts life in this area during WWII. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing.,1
"If it was longer, it could compete with the longer films. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen.",1
"I truly was unsure of how it would end, which kept me on edge while i watched and waited. Even an average performance here damages the overall product. This one holds water, unlike a couple other Hitchcock films I've seen.",1
They come from a poor farm family in Mississippi.,1
"Well, Willie isn't having any of it, if Pete can be a soldier so can he. 7 / 10 < br / > < br / > This movie is like a cold bottle of water. We are shown the devotion and love of a little brother ( Jonathan Furr ).",1
"Great work by a great D. P., David Boyd.",1
Two Soldiers is an excellent example of fine film - making. The performance was extremely well cast.,1
Ron Perlman gives a gruff but touching peformance as the Army Colonel who decides to help kid.,1
Two Soldiers is an excellent example of fine film - making. The performance was extremely well cast.,1
Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world. Our frame of reference is the fantasy realm which the lone knight perhaps remembers. Don Quixote considered himself a true knight among animals.,1
"I've watched it at least a dozen times. It's more like Judgment. < br / > < br / > That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq. < br / > < br / > Le Dernier Combat is not "" Sci Fi "".",1
"A superb movie. A tight, well - crafted, cost - effective budget movie.",1
"It was nominated Oscar for Best Cinematography. Very good! Bruno talks about a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife, and Bruno hates his father, so Bruno "" suggests "" swapping murders. Basically tennis champ Guy Haines ( Farley Granger ) meets eccentric stranger, Bruno Anthony ( Robert Walker ) on a train travelling from Washington to New York. Turley and John Brown as Prof. Collins, and Hitchcock's cameo is the Man boarding train carrying a double bass.",1
The most noticed element of the film is its silence ; no one speaks. This is one of the few truly good films that Luc Besson has written. How can they not be? Its vehicle is the stylized sci - fi movie.,1
Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way.,1
"long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! if you are a concept movie fan this is one of most original and classic.",1
"Copies of the video are hard - to - find, I would give my left eye ball for one. The Man is rescued by a crazy old genius who lives in a fortress of his own design. A poetic examination of the human condition performed without dialogue.",1
The characters'actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. < br / > < br / > There are no words in Besson's work. Some barbarian hordes were formed. He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. It's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times.,1
"I guess I won't really say more than that because I don't want to spoil anything. Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. < br / > < br / > But after those 40 minutes, things start to get very interesting.",1
See this movie.,1
"I will be the first to cheer it. And so it happened. There is not a problem with this movie : its cinematography is genius, as well the perfomances of the actors. Let's hope Besson starts working in a new directorial project. But it never came. This movie was no exception.",1
"The first time I saw it I was just blown away by the suspense, action and imagery. When the closely - fought contest is over, the climactic chase takes place. Eventually, they meet and the story takes over.",1
This one is no exception. Great movie. The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight.,1
He brings his own style to the movie. < br / > < br / > I'd definitely recommend!,1
"Beware : No happy ending. "" ? Don't we already know what really happens in real life?",1
"Go rent it, see if you don't shed a tear. The beach scenes were immaculate shot.",1
I really liked this film because it was moving sweet.,1
"< br / > < br / > The beach house is a work of art - fabulous. Its beautiful. Some lines rang so true, and other lines were embarrassingly trite and flat. < br / > < br / > This is not a lighthearted romantic comedy, more a romantic drama. She redeems him. We get so much more here with Rodanthe. < br / > < br / > The intimacy they create by sharing their deepest insecurity, fans into a flame of passion.",1
"Both, also, are searching for healing. So, I have to say it is well worth viewing. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are great in their lead roles. And there were moments that moved me to the verge of tears.",1
I think this show was right on the money for me.,1
"is because of the fine acting & excellent production. Tragedy happens, one of them dies.",1
"< br / > < br / > Scott Glenn steals the show in a one scene meeting with Gere. It's basically the story of lost loves, redemption and a triumph of the human spirit.",1
"< br / > < br / > What drives Bruno? Guy laughs it off, but Bruno ain't kidding, as Guy finds out to his peril. It's the You know, it must be pretty exciting to be so important. "" Many commentators suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty Guy.",1
"Soon, they find comfort in each other's arms and discover that they too can have a second chance in life. You feel energized, invigorated and alive. He is now being sued by her family and he is guilt ridden but hardened about the issue. Diane Lane lights the screen up with her smile. Why you might ask? He also just lost a patient as she reacted negatively to anesthetic. He stays at the Inn that Adrienne is taking care of. This is what brings him to Rodanthe in the first place.",1
"It's a great movie with a great story line. I laughed and I smiled just as much. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. For me I could relate to this movie with my whole heart.",1
"Oh yes! Hollywood does remember how to use the good old formula, and when lightning hits, it's a rather wonderful feeling. It could have a silly musical, but it did touch us because it was played with intensity and conviction. "" We get very few romantic comedies, and we are people who are starved for them. < br / > < br / > Ms. Lane makes this film pulsate with intelligence and passion. Then, there is a little important part, often neglected by the marketing geniuses that so often lack creativity and vision : a good actor.",1
They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest. Still the movie does work. So it's predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting. Every single bit of the plot is predictable. I give it a 7. I rolled my eyes a lot at some of the events. < br / > < br / > This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film. It's beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes. Also it's far too short - - I didn't believe the romance between Gere and Lane for a second.,1
"They somehow get separated and they try to find each other. The frog then leaps out an open window. Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall. ! Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. it is a giant FROG!!",1
"These are just some of the questions THE MAZE poses. Gerald goes off to Scotland, leaving his future bride behind. A few weeks pass and he doesn't come back. Why is Gerald so opposed to having company? And what's making those strange dragging noises every night? The movie actually does a fine job building up mystery and intrigue. Concerned, Kitty sends out telegrams but doesn't hear back from her fiancé. And then IT happens...",1
"A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to locate her evasive fiancé. Naturally, the two women get separated, setting the stage for engrossing suspense with horrific music. Worth seeing.",1
"Hitchcock is cinema's all time pervert ; however, we all know his perversions are ours as well, so we forgive him. And we not only forgive him but we applaud his clever way to invite us for an unforgettable train ride. < br / > < br / > Barely perfect! Safer indeed.",1
But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I'd recommend it to anyone. I remember this film of old.,1
I loved it.,1
"They were in House Party 3 when they were 11, but they are all grown up now!",1
"Who is main character? maybe it's the same in USA, or especially GB. < br / > < br / > Very well played by all this is a must seen. < br / > < br / > The Final maybe change your own mind.",1
They also bound him and shaved his private parts. Why was he unpopular?,1
"On their own official website they describe it as "" an inexplicably overlooked gem from the early days of Channel 4 "" - overlooked by who? The acting, writing and direction are very bold for 1983 and still pack a wallop today in spite of the upper crust accents of the central characters.",1
The film has everything. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated.,1
What a surprise.,1
"Good, I think I've made it to the 10 line limit. < br / > < br / > I'm still two lines short. Thanks for reading!",1
"THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really had little in it's favor. < br / > < br / > With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films. Bruno But Bruno knows all about Guy'personal problems. Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam, and is in love with Anne Morton, daughter of a Senator. From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes, and his contractual arrangement with David O. Selznick ended because of this.",1
"Woohoo! This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. There's a few subplots like Jekyll's fiancée, who is the daughter of the head doctor at Our Lady of Suffering and Pain, Jekyll's employer.",1
"Pearl Harbor, buddy. "" This movie is brilliant! """,1
I really liked that sound. Is that right?,1
"* "" I said,'Is this seat taken?'"" * "" Me! < br / > < br / > "" Here, take it. "" I must get this on DVD. I'm right handed. "" Me! "" * etc. I love this movie a lot.",1
"The timing was right, and many were able to see the business side of the healing companies behind the curtain of Oz. They were shocked that doctors, nurses, & the hospital institution were being mocked. Unfortunately they were like Republicans at a screening of Michael Moore's 9 / 11. The hundreds of other audience members were deadly silent. But - - forget everything I just said. This reality show is really about the sacred cows of medicine, seen as was the emperor without clothes.",1
"It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of "" Airplane. "" I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. What are you high?",1
Funniest thing I'd ever seen in a movie.,1
It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. Good thing DVDs don't wear out from use!!!! ! Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across.,1
Funny lines and sight gags are in abundance ; Blankfield plays each role for all it's worth. The climax even goes so far as to spoof old b & w horror films. < br / > < br / > One of the best bits is saved for last.,1
In the post Rodney King world a presidential candidate backed the police in sending 43 bullets at an unarmed man. He does not solicit help nor does he lie to his would be new wife. For the love of God it's called poetic license.. < br / > < br / > Back to the movie... < br / > < br / > Go watch it with. How many times have you been in either person's shoes and made the right choice?,1
"You're a nurse, what can you give me for it? """,1
It seemed longer than its 90 minutes. Good luck.,1
"back in the old days. So it's not an award winner, so what? I think the whole film is just fun.",1
"So it's a little dated now, it's almost 30 yrs old. If it came to DVD I'd snap it up in a heartbeat. Then it wasn't as'harmful '. I can remember my father crying he was laughing so hard watching this.",1
A good Comedy FIX. I Loved this movie. Let's hope so.,1
I highly recommend it. Totally psychedelic experience without the drugs! This is a movie I could watch over and over again. Mark Blankfield is absolutely hilarious.,1
It'beautiful. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it. I was 3 years old.,1
"Too bad, because it is FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY! I doubt it! Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde. < br / > < br / > Of course.",1
"This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI.",1
"He spends time "" over there "" in World War One trenches. * * * of 4 stars. Several gags stand out : Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them.",1
Anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical manoeuvre on Haines'part to provide himself with a shortcut to a career. The character differences are also reinforced visually. The lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain unsolved. < br / > < br / > ( 4 ) The scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularly.,1
"Pretty funny stuff. Daring because, after all, the war was still going on and this was a comedy about a serious business. ( That's where we got the term "" trench foot "" from. )",1
"He's in France for one thing : to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success. < br / > < br / > Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before go to war.",1
"To do so he impersonates a german kolonel or something. The soldier looks at him in a funny way so Charlie changes his mind : ja ja ja! When Charlie wakes up his legs feel numb so he tries to'wake them up '. I can't really describe it, just watch the movie. This is such a funny part!",1
< br / > < br / > If there is one film that I could stand behind and bet the house that anyone I would show it to would find it flawless it'Shoulder Arms.,1
< br / > < br / > There are plenty of other great moments in this film. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! Highly recommended.,1
In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. What remains is first rate but one leaves wanting more... and feeling a trifle cheated. This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. Here we see the tramp succeed in capturing Wilhelm and the general staff at the conclusion.,1
"< br / > < br / > Rating : Naturally, when the enemy discovers his ruse, the soldier darts straight for the forest. SPOILERS BELOW < br / > < br / > ` A Dog's Life'was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing.",1
"All of these scenes are show - stoppers, reminiscent of the most wonderful Chaplin scenes. This one should not be missed!",1
"< br / > < br / > Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. He was a great supporter of the Allied cause, unusual for someone of his left wing views. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.",1
"His father sent him to the police station carrying a note. This is not something that was done by accident. In fact, Hitchcock edited two versions of the movie : one US, one UK. < br / > < br / > "" Strangers on a Train "" is probably one of the best in his "" wrongly - accused "" series. The movie is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. < br / > < br / > The most famous shot in the movie occurs during a tennis match. < br / > < br / > Bruno's performance is meant to be seductive and homoerotic. She was always fascinated by smart criminals. The motives are respectively love and money.",1
"Even with wars raging, Chaplin can lift the spirits of millions. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best.",1
"< br / > < br / > Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http : / / ferdinandvongalitzien. < br / > < br / > To mock the war trenches, the unhealthiness, frontal attacks and the Germans ( how you dare!!... Obviously Herr Charlie Chaplin had very much of it.",1
"I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > Why? < br / > < br / > All this said, Barnens Ö is a story of discovery. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? It is not. It is a film of overwhelming hope and desperation. expectations for any Swedish film were pretty high.",1
It is such a shame it is not out on DVD or video. I laughed from beginning to end.,1
"It creates its own absurd universe. This film has many memorable bizarre, goofy, wacky moments. That film was finally released on DVD and has developed a cult following. It's obviously a product of the sixties but so is just about everything else from that era.",1
"I don't think it is ever shown anymore. The film is full of vignettes of the commuters life, the suburban life, the city officials, and all the attitudes so dearly held. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they "" really are ""... All of it is humorous, nobody is mean.",1
Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean (? ) or department head is priceless.,1
"< Senator Morton is authoritative and self - absorbed. Wrong. This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, and one of his most underrated. It is a disturbing, stunning performance that illuminates the whole film. We have the whore Miriam, Granger's estranged wife pregnant to another man.",1
"And what's more, this film is actually entertaining. It won't bore you at all, not even for a minute!",1
"If you want something "" different "", look no further. It's out there.",1
"What fantasies and incongruities the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes. < br / > < br / > when he doesn't? The movie must be one of those, pun and all.",1
"This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. And that food inspector scene is the best! Is that Flea? He looks an awful lot like Shrek. "" Look at the roadmap, for one thing!",1
"'t be fooled by the cover ( if you happen to rent or buy this film ) - - the movie is not what it might seem to be on the surface. In addition, the symbolic representations are left open for interpretation, which can be said of much great artwork.",1
Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!,1
"< br / > < br / > Motorama is great material for fans of strange b - grade comedies. Thought it may seem totally bizarre on first viewing, it is actually a well - designed narrative. Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b - grade desert - based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man ( which more or less takes place in the desert ).",1
"and the lines to follow will stay in my mind forever probably. The first time I saw it was from rental. so if you're in the mood for one of those types of movies, yippee!",1
I also expected to see more Drew Barrymore here too!,1
An odd little gem of a movie.,1
"Well, this is about as good as they come. Pluto. "" < br / > < br / > 1. ( Did Carl Jung see this movie? Hardly anything in it is accidental. What does Hitchcock show us?",1

This is no kid's flick! He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters.,1
"So jump in your red Mustang, get a tattoo spelling "" Tora "" and cruise Strangeland with Gus. But if you enjoy reading Edgar Alan Poe or the works of Tim Burton, then you will like Motorama.",1
I like what he does & he does it well nuff said!,1
"i enjoyed it nonetheless, even if it is extremely derivative.",1
Lowe is at its best in this riveting thriller. It's amazing what you can do with little money.,1
"Julia discovers that the Meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities. Kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for Julia. They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. Amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was good as well. Amanda really starts to warm up to Kevin as the film progresses, perhaps more than to her aunt. He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda deal with her distress. The plot has holes, but the lead performers make it work.",1
The Outer Limits is a brilliant show that for the most part leaves me with very strong emotions.,1
What you'll also notice each week is an actor / actress you'll know from a past show which is pretty neat in its own way.,1
"< br / > < br / > Arguably one of the pioneering "" suspense thrillers "", Strangers on a Train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects, but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in 1951 ( if perhaps slightly less shocking ). These are only brief moments, but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film. Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock, it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry.",1
I am still trying to find the seasons on DVD. Those guys were producers on stargate sg - 1. You could never predict what was going to happen.,1
"Hence, The "" balance "" equation being solely there is no one.",1
I love that show. Ah the Outer Limits.,1
"What fuels this depravity is good old fashioned greed. < br / > < br / > A truly subversive episode! Nor do the ends justify the means! The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops. Unlike real life, justice here is served - and swiftly! One that should be shown on prime time television for all to see! < br / > < br / > 2. < br / > < br / > This episode is brilliant! I would like to offer my own.",1
The series is well - written in a different story each week.,1
"You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. ! LONG LIVE THE NEW OUTER LIMITS!!!!!!!!! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun to watch, but the New OUTER LIMITS is where it's at!",1
"It is an adult series without unbearable teenage know - it - all fantasies. Hurray! It has brains, history, a message and good entertainment.",1
"< br / > < br / > It's only in fun that I point out the negatives and goofs, ( Great scenes with Stiles telling a good deal of the human knowledge of the Romulans. To start off, this happens to be my favorite of the ST OS. I would have used phasers at this point, but I'm sure it had to do with the technicians and budget ). when it attacks the Enterprise the first time. Also his conflict with Spock is right up there.",1
"I just thought I would add another observation, here. ).",1
"Soon enough, a Romulan vessel appears, carrying a new weapon and a cloaking device which makes it nearly impossible to defeat. No need to say who wins...",1
Bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for the criss - cross murders. Guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement. Ethical Passivity : some weaknesses of the Guy character are intended by Hitchcock. < br / > < br / > 2. Guy is unable to effectively block Bruno's crazy proposals at the start.,1
"This contrasts sharply with Captain Kirk and the Romulan commander, neither of whom has any personal ill will towards the other at all. In fact there's a mutual respect. Kirk wisely chooses the latter. < br / > < br / > Like The Enemy Below, we have a classic chess match between two ship commanders who are actually very much alike. And boy did Roddenberry and company do something cool with this one.",1
You'll see it holds up. Those are not my favorite genre but I certainly would recommend a fan of such to view this episode through that filter. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie ( or Trekker - - your preference ) it takes you out of the scene at first.,1
The chain - mail armor is really cool. A must both for Trekkies and sword - and - sandal epic fans. The atmosphere of war - time paranoia is all too real.,1
"Oddly, for the die - hard Trekkers out there, they'll recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played Spock's father. Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series.",1
!,1
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts ; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars. In fact, I believe this episode holds the record for ship casualties by the end of it.",1
"A must - see episode! """,1
"The two farm dogs steal the show, even though they only appear in two scenes.",1
"It's incredible. This is one of the best Disney films I ever saw and one of my favorites. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. "" The Ally cat had a great voice! I also enjoy their journey home. That part is adorable. I give this film 10 / 10 stars. Everyone should see it.",1
"So from scene one, on the train ( and the train, really gorgeous! And crime. Yet you think : can it hold up even when the huge ( and clever, and amazing ) trick of the plot is no surprise? We know entering the film, however, that this won't be the case, so already we are worried. ( This uncanny performance is equivalent to that of another Hitchcock wacko, played by Anthony Perkins insycho. ) < br / > < br / > Yes.",1
"This is one of my favorite films, ever. An absolute must! That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.",1
But I remember liking it a lot. He puts knockout drops in their milk.,1
"However, the story is interesting and exciting particularly for younger audiences, I'll wager and the musical numbers { which I wish were more numerous } are terrific.",1
"It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. < br / > < br / > The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. I also like the dogs, who tend to argue over who is'the leader. Even though he's the bad guy, he's still lovable all the same.",1
"How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart.",1
"And of course we like, that the score is quite Jazzy. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. When "" Madame "" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble.",1
"The representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing. The film has the importance and relevance of home but is not cemented enough ; it seems very far fetched and irrelevant. < br / > < br / > With Disney, you always get a strong meaningful message. There are hardly any lapses and no dull moments. However with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing.",1
Walt Disney's 20th animated feature was the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself ( he died in late 1966 ) and is not generally considered to be among their very best output.,1
"It looked beautiful. 8. In conclusion, a really pleasant film, that is definitely underrated. They remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters, always fighting. The supporting characters, namely Scat Cat, were also well done.",1
"The Aristocats "" is classic Disney at it's best. I'll liked it very much as a kid. And the songs are really catchy too. The character animation and design is great.",1
"So accused of a murder he didn't commit and expected to commit another, what is Guy going to do? The following week he isn't laughing any more.",1
"We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! < br / > < br / > Apart from "" Peter Pan "" ( now that is a 10 / 10 film ), this is my favourite Disney film. And "" Thomas O'Malley "" is just as enjoyable. My 7 year - old son loves it, his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it, so you can't ask much more of a family film. Isn t that what these films are about? < br / > < br / > Superb!",1
"You should watch it, watch it and love it. !",1
< br / > < br / > Sometimes slow paced but still enjoyable Disney venture.,1
Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! But Thomas'friends arrive to help save the day. < br / > < br / > This is a charming film. 10 / 10.,1
But he fails. This movie is great I really enjoyed it. The cats break into song.,1
This is one of my favourite Disney films.,1
Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans!,1
! I must say one big reason why I thought the AristoCats was so great is because I love cats!!!,1
8. I think that The Aristorcats is so funny and cute. There is nothing wrong with it at all. The Cat's out of the bag. I'd of killed them also.,1
Who doesn't want their kids exposed to these values? The music is great. The love story is quite romantic.,1
Walker died the following year with most of My Son John finished. Hitchcock does not do too bad by Farley Granger either. And also in that final climax with fight on a runaway carousel between Walker and Granger.,1
"( This is probably one of Disney's least memorable villains. ) All are excellent here, particularly Harris and Gabor in the leads. The various animal characters are similarly familiar to those who have seen "" Tramp "" and "" Dalmatians. """,1
< br / > < br / > This rates an 8.,1
"< br / > < br / > As usual, legendary Disney actors voice the characters. That is hysterical! Other characters have their moments as well. I personally see it as one of my favorite Disney classics. < br / > < br / > Too bad that "" The Aristocats "" doesn't get the deserved credit.",1
"Not one of the greatest Disney animated movies but a cult Disney animated fave and one of the few gems of it's day that works well, highly recommended.",1
No. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. I'm not kidding with this one. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something.,1
"The songs and story is just memorable. AristoCats is also very witty and clever, the story was just so wonderful. This is a terrific film, please watch it, you won't be disappointed.",1
"They go to the opera, and make fun of it. He thinks fast. He is introduced to everyone and everything. Unluckily, his day isn't very good. He does it wrong and blows up the school, leaving himself green. He gives it to the psychologist. They call him a point dexter. Bart can't answer one question. Bart is told by the psychologist to tell him why he did it. The next day Homer drives Bart to the new school. Later that day Marge and Homer are called to go to the Principal's office to discuss Bart's behavior.",1
I rate this episode 73 %.,1
The sheer lack of visual limitations when compared to live - action. It always seems to me that it's an episode that grows on you. < br / > < br / > On a writing stand - point it's also highly intelligent and fresh. There's no gimmickry or theme it's just your typical Simpsons episode in set - up.,1
"Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother. "" Consider him a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in "" Single White Female. "" Strangers on a Train "" was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing. < br / > < br / > Hitchcock loved the Oedipial elements in his movies ( also see ""sycho "" for more blatant undertones ) and there's a lot of that here.",1
"It may be just a cartoon, but it's a cartoon that intellectuals, geeks and nerds are going to understand more than anyone else. Bart comes up with "" kwyjibo "", which he insists is a word. Marge can only come up with "" he "". < br / > < br / > This episode firmly establishes Bart's "" slacker "" personality, and more subtly, Lisa's intellectual superiority to the whole family. Lisa comes up with "" id "" for her word - - short, but something you have to be well educated to know.",1
! I love watching him!,1
"Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? But what J - bone is doing, does it work? I like movies with suspense! by TyNesha Mells.",1
I could not do that with this film.,1
"Now he has to choose : Love Or Crime. He needed more screen time. She overacts every scene and brings the movie down. Ving Rhames is perfect as J - Bone. """,1
"It didn't bother me. It was haunting : visual, textural, sensual. I love this movie. I've been looking for it ever since.",1
But it is great to see Mr. T. back into action. I absolutely adore them!!,1
"Re But nonetheless, this was a great effort on the part of JLC. Well, not by anyone that I know of, that is. < br / > < br / > I just didn't understand why she wasn't featured in the show.",1
"He did talk to Mr. T ( Sgt. A. "" Baracus ) in an anticipated interview, but he was unavailable to turn up at the reunion.",1
She didn't just get the job because of her dad ; she can act. Hitchcock's real - life daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here.,1
I thought it was brilliant! Let'hope that they repeat it again.,1
The film is a conversation.,1
"Although both men differ in acting styles, his take on James Aaron is right on the money. James takes a liking to the woman, who one day invites him to go shopping with her for intimate apparel. Being a large man, he clearly identifies with the character in the movie. In many ways, James'own life parallels that of the Paddy Chayefsky's creation in the picture. Sarah Silverman makes an impression for her take of Beth.",1
Any fan of Jeff Garlin'TV appearances must see it! Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter.,1
"< br / > < br / > James's relationship with his mother was also interesting. In short, I thought it would be a comedy. And yet, is it a sensitive guy film? He isn't really a sensitive guy. Likable, sure. I applaud the decision. Is that a good thing?",1
"The laughs keep coming almost every minute. This explains why they work so well. Bonnie Hunt is classically great in her role. There were numerous other cameos, all of them done very well. Real life people are always unusually colorful and makes great characters. Mina Kolb plays Jeff's mother who he lives with. The wordy title should clue you in to this. < br / > < br / > David Pasquesi was the aloof detached sidekick, and voice of reason.",1
"Bonnie Hunt gives an endearing performance as a romantic interest. < br / > < br / > Don't let a simple story mislead you, the characters and conflicts are well thought out and ring true. Garlin is unquestionably a comedian's comedian and a comedian to anyone looking for a good time. His first film, which is entirely his own creation and production, tells the story of a struggling Chicago actor James Aaron with whom Jeff obviously identifies.",1
"< br / > < br / > It does have many tones of seriousness throughout, but fear not, for it is also very funny. And as I said before, while the ending may seem absurd at first, once you take time to think about, it is a true joy. But I actually thought about this one on the way home. The ending came kind of abruptly and had me saying, "" that's it!? "" It is the kind of movie that you keep watching and always enjoy. But once it starts to take it's toll, it really makes you smile.",1
"Almost stealing the movie is character actress Mina Kolb, who plays James'pixilated mother with pluck and heart. In fact, Garlin uses "" Marty "" as the play which James is desperate to do since he is so empathetic to the character's situation.",1
He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in. The man was simply born for the part.,1
Relax and go see it. Came across as a very sincere story. Garlin did a great job.,1
"Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act ; his writing was pretty darn good. Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. * * * out of four.",1
Try not to miss!,1
"Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience.",1
"In short, he's what more actors should be like. """,1
"What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. Highly recommended.",1
"A must see for Macy fans! ). """,1
William H. Macy is terrific in this Alfred Hitchcock - esque film. The characters that ensue are hilarious.,1
"< br / > < br / > Bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy. Bruno's life is one of repetition, circularity, whereas Guy moves straight ahead. This is Hitch's most surreal film.",1
"This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. But you may want to prepare to feel little guilty. < br / > < br / > Good performances all around, too, not just with Macy. Arkin was quite good, as was Cromwell ( he was surprisingly fierce ).",1
"Co - scripted by William H. Macy from, arguably, Donald E. Westlake's best and hardest to find novel, "" A Travesty "". "". Costars Adam Arkin and James Cromwell in good supporting roles.",1
"That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. In her first post - BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance. Merwin Gerard's teleplay is based on a short story by McKnight Malmar.",1
must see! This movie was ( and still is ) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very young.,1
i really wish i could see this movie again.,1
I remember watching this movie when it came out as a t. v. movie of the week in the early 1970's. < br / > < br / > They just don't make t. v. movies like this one anymore.,1
"I gave this movie vote of seven. The cast in this movie was top notch. I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.",1
"The same can be said for her earlier, also excellent movie, A Case of Rape.",1
I thought this movie was pretty good!,1
!,1
And I think they became equally warped. And this movie is one of the scariest one in 2005! That's another story in the book. Rating 4 out of 5 stars. She beats Vanna HANDS DOWN!,1
"Nick the car thief is the sexiest! Her bra straps are showing for, like 1 / 2 the movie! See, that'just the kind of guy he is. That's a little too high - maintenance for me.",1
It is plain rude! What did Paris do to you? Lol. What if that was you?,1
"In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted. If they weren't in the movie, well, you might not really like it too much. Obviously, you know who will with what I just typed. I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. at times, but it is very easy to watch.",1
11 / 10. Thumbs up.,1
i got my whole school into it.,1
!,1
"Gory, eh? Even better than the Amityville Horror. Fans of horror films MUST see.",1
Even the soundtrack is great. Be thankful that Cam Archer exists in this world. It goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film. I know this from first hand experience.,1
"< br / > < br / > 3. < br / > < br / > 5. nicks best friend Dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs, and then is decapitated. but this one is worth it. she finds this like garage with all these cars in it. I've NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED OR LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE. his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink.. then he gets covered in wax.",1
"The causes for horror are in part based on making the audience care for the characters, which we do. Not bad. Paris Hilton appears in this film as many already know, but I really have to give it to her for her ballsy performance. By making the usual buildup followed with a loud noise and jerked camera some other scary moments. In fact there isn't a slow moment after they get to the small town where the dreaded House of Wax museum is. These standard movie techniques adopted from many movies past are almost perfected with this film, and provide many good scares.",1
"They decide to camp in a field halfway and proceed their journey on the next day. My vote is seven. < br / > < br / > I liked this "" House of Wax "", indeed a worthwhile teen horror movie.",1
"I recently saw House of Wax and must say i really enjoyed it. < br / > < br / > well as for the character development, i think it worked amazingly well.",1
"Or a Golden Globe. Hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming. ( And a kick - ass ending, which i won't spoil. )",1
"We meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together. But the filmmakers don't stop there and add a little something extra each time for each victim. Overall, all the actor's were very good. < br / > < br / > Now for the death scenes. I'm not gonna go into detail for the plot since I'm sure you know about it.",1
Directed by Jaume Collet - Serra. My final rating 7 / 10.,1
"Her character is put through a lot, and Cuthbert proves to be a feisty heroine. < br / > < br / > And a congrats to Paris Hilton for proving a lot of people wrong. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch. Like she always says - "" That's hot. "" Congrats to cast and crew for a job well done.",1
"I don't think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. "". ( A clear example is the mindless "" Saint Ange "". ) Some scenes are truly, satisfyingly horrible, making up for tense moments scattered around all the film.",1
"< br / > < br / > House of Wax has many strengths. The first is that it is blessed with a very likable cast. He is instantly likable and he possesses a strong character trait. Overall, it is quite a well done film that should do okay on DVD. But he has a presence to him.",1
But Dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those boyhood things aside.,1
Jon Abrahams was pretty good as goofy best bud of CMM. It showed how he really cared. Bravo!,1
"< br / > < br / > Upon hearing of this, a remake of the classic Vincent Price B - movie, I rolled my eyes. It also gives the young actors portraying them something grip on. I don't think I am alone when I say that 2005 has not been particularly kind to the horror genre.",1
"and moan "" that's hot "" but they didn't do that ( how could they resist??? < br / > < br / > There is NO nudity from the 2 girls although Paris looks great in her lingerie! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN ( Horrible! ).",1
"It is definitely worth a watch. The reality is that Paris has a fairly minimal part, she spends the vast majority of the movie off screen.",1
The town is creepy and I'm just gonna stop there. This is the definition of being a horror film. Because thats when the truly gruesome mayhem begins. trust me when I say if your looking for a horror film go see this you will love it. Paris Hilton included whom does quite well with her part.,1
"Not only does Blondell miss stardom, boyfriend, Murphy ( Eddie ) falls for Turner as well. Look for Paul Ford, as a gossip columnist in the film.",1
"< br / > < br / > So, viewers take notice! The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability.",1
What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous.,1
"What it was, was boring and monotone. Given that Cooper himself tended to be the strong, silent type on screen, we could have used a little animation. This documentary, alas, was definitely produced by a man. York. "" That smile, those lips, that bone structure - he was handsome throughout his life, but in films like "" Morocco "" and "" Desire, "" he is devastating. Also, Clint Eastwood's narration was described as unobtrusive.",1
One to enjoy. Very enjoyable 50's Western. Likely 6. They all joined as scouts after their loss.,1
If you love Cooper that is. Or an older America...,1
"< br / > < br / > This real objective of this movie revolves around more on the monk who were primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures. Problems crept deeper and this is where conflicts between the relationship gets worse. < br / > < br / > A wonderfully created and funny acts awaits those who buys this ticket. Though ugly, she did not let her appearance be casted aside from getting to him.",1
Any battle for my heart was won once I saw main protagonist dressed as spider - man - awesome! What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings? Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time.,1
"Monkey tries his best to battle them but is overwhelmed, knowing his master is in grave danger, he uses his trusty golden staff to thrust Tripitaka to safety. So the mismatched pair begins their adventure together. So overall, I liked it.",1
How do we get from thing to thing is often beyond me. Another go round with the monkey king going west.... sort of. < br / > < br / > Can a movie that starts off the rails go off the rails? Action and comedy aside this is actually a wonderful love story. The movie starts and you have no idea where things are and then whats on screen is either interesting or funny and you just go with it. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. Very very funny at times.,1
! So you better be as experienced and open minded. Once you actually accept that this movies not to be taken too seriously then you'll enjoy it even more. Sometimes people has to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start yapping about. And people quit whining about how it borrowed from other movies! But it really didn't matter because I still enjoyed it to it's full length.,1
"It's not quite a great historical drama, but it does satisfy well enough. < br / > < br / > This is a great spy movie. In many ways the American Revolution was definitely a family affair, in that some of the wealthier colonial families were split asunder by it. He seems to vary from being a prickly kind of patriot to being a kind of'anything for the cause,'fellow.",1
"This aspect of the story, then, bears a general resemblance to historical fact. The plains tribe of Assiniboines is mentioning as joining Red Cloud. All the main characters are well cast.",1
I don't get it because there are a lot of other better choices. I can't get this flick off my brain. WTF is up with the world? The thing that's best is the kaliedescope style. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. There is some really serious stuff mixed with super interesting footage of the road.,1
"Naive schoolboy, suicidal blonde, embittered car thief - - all converge with unexpected twists. It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. The drama is compelling.",1
The film score is nicely understated. Blind Spot's images are great. The story is heart - wrenching.,1
The tone is everything. James Franco is totally cool in this movie.,1
< br / > < br / > Edvard Absolutely nothing!!!,1
I still carry many of images in my mind. I really admired the story and visual approach. You really feel for this guy.,1
The construction of the film itself is a master craft. I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time.,1
"Strange. The cast is great. "" The film has a powerful style. Suspenseful. Beautiful to look at.",1
"The loneliness, the < br / > < br / > Darcy invites Danny to his house. Think "" High Sierra "" or "" White Heat. "" < br / > < br / > From the beginning, you know this is going to be bad. But the house is empty and for sale, and a bloody check for thousands of dollars is on the floor.",1
< br / > < br / > Cheers Stephan!,1
99,1
etch this movie and get liberated,1
"They actually had real punk from back in the day like the Ramones... That in itself made the film better! This is a funny, clever film and well worth your time. I hadn't heard of this film, so I guess it didn't get much press, which is kind of a shame.",1
"His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. haha i laughed very hard. 'its a message of non - comformity and has traces of anti - authority sprinkled in as well. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But not only are messages great - its hilarious! Fraternities beware.",1
"Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given.",1
overdone soliloquy completely tears apart the established educational system as we know it.,1
"One of the best films of the year. said, "" ASK ME ABOUT MY WEINER "".",1
She spends her time meditating. He's known for making fake IDs. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. They're amazing. < br / > < br / > Monica is a B's love interest. so an acceptance letter is no problem. Glen got a zero on his SATs and has no thought process. Picture Lewis Black playing himself. Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie.,1
The film ends on a high and i recommend you watching it. However loads of people see his fake website and join. The school faces opposition from proper college which ends up closing it down.,1
I rate this movie a very fair 78 %. The movie is about Bartelby.,1
i think it deserves 7 / 10,1
"You what they say "" If there is a will there is a way. Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. And may be sometimes the children know better what they need than their parents. Now he and his friend have to figure that collage thing out not only for themselves but for the others too. Along with all the fun the movie brings a very common subject to our attention i. e. the collage education.",1
"Also noteworthy as Bartleby's hyper - intelligent and sarcastic little sister is Hannah Marks. When they go a little too far with the website and other kids end up enrolling, the kids have a few problems to solve.",1
'The humour was varied which I loved. From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar!,1
Lewis Black.... enough said. I went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor. ~!,1
"He hires Uncle Ben ( Lewis Black ) as the College Dean. Since it was a fake college, Bartleby really didn't need a staff. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. They will be the only students. The movie was made for the young crowd to have a little fun.",1
I now regret that decision.,1
"Long is from "" Ed "" and the new Apple computer ads. I was pleasantly surprised. He's a natural in front of the camera. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect.",1
I encourage you to go see the movie.,1
I laughed. A great movie.,1
< br / > < br / > Awesome ending. I for one was very anxious to watch this movie.,1
"Rather than blame the Indians for their losses they decide it's the army's fault for building the fort and decide to demand compensation from them, ending up joining their ranks as scouts instead.",1
This is what movies should aspire to.,1
"Nowadays, movies are either remakes or sequels, or plots that have been used in many different films. With this well thought out story and with laughs mixed in, this is a good movie. If you want to laugh out loud, that is.",1
I just wanted to say that.,1
"Frankly, I cried!",1
HE later thinks he is in heaven. This is a brilliant film. ).,1
"This movie has different tear - jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes ( particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal ). Yet the focus remains on sensitive ties of both love and learning about one's self. Eight out of Ten Stars.",1
"i totally disagree with the person who first commented about this movie. < br / > < br / > and i must admit, it made me tear little.",1
"It'not the best movie ever, but it was nice! I recommended to you all.",1
"'His real problems start after he becomes strongly attracted to the colonel's wife, Corrina. I expected either Jed or the colonel's wife to reap some retribution for their sin.",1
"First off, I absolutely loved this movie. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion.",1
"It's a real shame. Late in the film, his being annoying, abrasive and needlessly cruel seemed to have diminished. Warning - - this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways.",1
With many systems. That's right. And the message is sad.,1
"He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after only one look. But he refuses to be manipulated. I'm's sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact. It is not surprising that this film was made by I'm at the time it was. Art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off "" Oh Won. """,1
"One of the strengths? 8 / 10 It's firmly on the painter. < br / > < br / > In the end, it's a well made film about the life of a painter. Yay for art!",1
"I'm's sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact. But he refuses to be It is not surprising that this film was made by I'm Kwon Taek at the time it was. Art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off "" Oh Won. "" He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after only one look.",1
I would highly recommend this film to art lovers and movie lovers alike.,1
What a movie! But altogether this is an excellent film!,1
"Not here. Good show, and underrated movie, all around. Ordinarily, Anthony Mann made westerns with'the big guys'- James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda... the A list cowboy stars. The battle sequences are big scale and notably violent, and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format.",1
You owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collection. < br / > < br / > I highly recommend. I first saw Macy Gray's name in the credits and went ho - hum.,1
Why?... But some of these characters were used too much. Just don't expect a smooth ride. < br / > < br / > 7 of 10 but almost a 6. While borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard. Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I had no problem with any of them in end.,1
"< br / > < br / > The story is told with extreme economy. A feeling evoked is hardly ever lingered with or explained, it just appears quickly then is gone for the next one to appear. It has a classical restraint, much like Ohwon's paintings. I have seen it twice and it was very rewarding on the second viewing.",1
"The question thus arises if recreation itself deserves artistic merit. < br / > < br / > Rainbows of color enter the film at points as the artist observes nature and especially women that then become reflected in his paintings. Instead of creating his own completely original works, Jang finds himself mostly recreating masterpieces of other artists throughout East Asia. For example, many scenes would change seemingly in mid conversation picking up at another point and location. Chi - hwa - seong ( Painted Fire ) recounts the life of Korean painter Jang Seong - ub amidst the changing political landscape of late 19th century Korea.",1
"Yes, each scene is like a work of Jang's painting. Wow, What a wonderful film - making! Mr. Im has done it, again! He was an orphan, but in his teens, he was picked up by a noble man, called, Kim, Byung - Moon. And script is perfect, too. The basic story of this film tells the life of Jang, Seung - up, and the historical background of his time.",1
"That is a really lazy way to think of a movie. This is not the basic Kung - fu movie. If you want to watch this, its not about the fighting really.",1
"This is a video game and not an actual movie. < br / > < br / > The story is obviously based on the story told in the movie. What if Jen had not gotten back her comb? All four of these characters have fighting styles based on how they fought in the movie. But, dude, what are you talking about?",1
to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind.,1
"< br / > < br / > AHEM! < br / > < br / > "" Attack of the Show "" deals with everything young people want to know about. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. It's music, movies, comic books, the internet and television. Some segments and bits they do are funny. Sorry. Now there is a new female co - host, the not - as - hot ( my opinion ) Olivia Munn. I cannot hate on the show.",1
"7 of 10 ; it will keep you in a young mindset which is good if you're a younger Baby Boomer like me ( mid 40's ). Maybe a cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do, there is a ton of stuff available they could use. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ). I'll keep watching since I watch at work and it's all that's on, hoping that I'll be entertained but it is getting somewhat old.",1
If you know those universes you will understand the jokes. I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. Sweet.,1
"< br / > < br / > It'a fun show, definitely worth checking out you are in your 20s or 30s. I give it an 8 out of 10. To compare the two shows is like comparing apples to oranges!",1
To me it's more the epidemy ( now that doesn't look spelled right! ) My favorite show of all time! < br / > < br / > So enough of my sad life : (.... Gee this show was fun to watch!,1

"A true cinematic work of art from a visionary director. Truly a forgotten classic, this one is worth hunting down and buying. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this movie. It shows.",1
"A recommended movie for whole family. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. A gem that deserves to be more well known for today's audiences as well.",1
< br / > < br / > I give this movie 9 out of 10. !,1
"357! Wow, that's an interesting twist! The film begins with one of the goofiest scenes I can remember in a film. < br / > < br / > Slaughter is now stumped. And, because job was bungled so badly, the mob boss ( Ed MacMahon!! ) And, naturally, there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the process. No, Slaughter isn't so tough that he then shoots down the plane with his.",1
"Not meant to be an epic by any means, this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold.",1
"Was'Hoffo'in the first one his brother or what? Any who. SMACK!! Why, I don't know. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town!",1
Even the first movie is pretty good.,1
"Every few minutes there appears one or more of the following : drug use, sex, nudity, gunplay, murder or some other action. Sadly, no mention at all is made of Brown's original sidekicks Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Brown returned to his role from the year before ( in "" Slaughter "" ) for this rough follow - up film. McMahon is a riot! Aside from a fairly dreary opening on horseback and a downright deadly car ride down a city street at night, this movie clips along at a very brisk pace. Seeing Johnny Carson's sidekick in a role like this is a perverse thrill.",1
Even Shaft. Big Jim Brown seems stronger as Slaughter here than in the first. Something the original was lacking.,1
I have been captured by this actresses delivery and shall eagerly seek out much more of her work. Understated in terms of dialogue but powerful in terms of presence.,1
Thumbs up to the Italian team who put this film together. High recommended. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.,1
I loved it. The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent.,1
"In this film, however, emotional truth is considerably more complex. We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. Highly recommended.",1
"All of the cast was awesome. ! Dennis Quaid is the man who is "" D. O.",1
"Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems! Always enjoyed "" DOA "", 1950, which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film.",1
"As a mystery novelist, Jerome Cowan is a good supporting actor as is Lloyd Corrigan as an aficionado in crime. < br / > < br / > Strongly recommended. The link to "" courage "" is not particularly clear. Direction, production design, and photography stand out. The set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good.",1
This is a whodunnit in the Hitchcock tradition.,1
Fairly decent movie. The plot is also quite original. Meg Ryan is fine as the student helper / love interest.,1
"The Cornell realizes that he HAS to read the manuscript, now. He drinks some more. When he goes home, his wife is waiting with divorce papers. She leaves, and he goes to a faculty affair, only to find her there.",1
"The original "" D. O. is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad. Charlotte Rampling is fine too in a supporting role. A. "" The plot is pretty much the same.",1
") as the plot gathers pace, and the dialogue is crisp and gritty. The colour drains from the film ( literally, not metaphorically! )",1
"The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography. The answer is no. < br / > < br / > The screenplay for this is like a pocket work of art. Catch it soon, it really is top - notch...! All these elements help to keep proceedings fresh.",1
Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I liked this movie a lot. That's how much I like it.,1
"Kay is the poisoner of dark forces : the temptation. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie.",1
"Nor is the story bound by modern Hollywood rules of composition : direct, often to the point of being grotesquely linear in lesser works, and obvious ( in retrospect, at least ).",1
I really enjoyed this film.,1
"< br / > < br / > Well worth a watch if you already like the genre, you won't be disappointed unless you really don't like the genre. And a more off - the - wall storyline too!",1
"It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I don't care. I recommend it to people of all ages. < br / > < br / > I thought the acting was bloody brilliant! I promise you will not be disappointed! I haven't even read the book, and guess what? This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it!",1
It was kinda weird seeing it in the movie. Now i totally wish i did.,1
"If you don't have it, it will probably be repeated on Channel 4 this Christmas, so record it! First off, I can remember vaguely being told this story in primary school, about 6 or 7 years ago so I am sort of familiar with the story. with I think a new thief character to represent Autumn ) throughout the imagery once you notice is quite startling and brilliantly executed. < br / > < br / > However as a whole I really love this film.",1
Enchanting. She only tries to surround Herself with love in the wrong way. It's music is also very nice.,1
"It is about as good as "" The Golden Compass "".",1
She injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season corrupted by the devil's evil magic. Instead it shows new ideas some real thinking on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the old themes of love and danger. People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out.,1
This is possibly one of my favorite films. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai.,1
< br / > < br / > I would love to see boxed DVD series of these films. It is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes.,1
"My favorite characters in this show are : Sylvia, Leon, and Nigel. It's the best, and you will see what I mean.",1
"8 episodes long, the overall story was that in 21st century Tokyo, Japan, year 2032 - 2033, living machines called Boomers were doing manual labor and sometimes cause problems.",1
"There are other parallels with the later work, too, which lead one to suspect a touch of a remake. < br / > < br / > Joey, who had seemed to personify the curse on their lives, is lost at sea - believed drowned - in a freak accident.",1
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. The overall tone and mood is excellent.,1
A beautiful piece of filmmaking. < br / > < br / > The direction is subtle and effective.,1
It's Showtime! A good break from shows like Cops.,1
"This is actually great fun. ! The acting is a lot of fun!. The Direction is very good!. I really enjoyed it, even though it wasn't that original at all, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together!.",1
No slapstick humor here. You'll love it. It has wonderful cast and crew.,1
"< br / > < br / > This is a terribly sweet movie that totally thinks "" outside the box. "" The rest of the story is magic. I thought IMDb for a database for movies, not TV shows. I don't want to try to describe this film because I want you to enjoy every surprise. It is not at all like a Hollywood formula movie, which is probably why the ( what's a nice word for idiots? ) My mistake.",1
"But I laughed. A lot. Don't listen to them. They have great chemistry. SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess.",1
"And besides, the film does have quirky moments of originality. And any bullet's highest level of inertia is at the moment of firing. Oh, what the heck... it's a satire. For a guy primarily known for serious roles, De Niro is a heckuva comic actor. < br / > < br / > Well, so what?",1
< br / > < br / > My Rating : 7 out 10. Directing Job : Nice. It's not going to move you or anything... but it's an extremely enjoyable movie. < br / > < br / > Top Performance : Murphy. De Niro has molded into this type of role perfectly. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Hilarious.,1
"I gave it an 8 out of 10. A trend downwards, of less use of the silly, less use of the exploding building. < br > < br / > Very good movie, but not a great movie. Overall, it was pretty good!",1
"Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. Just some useless trivia for ya. Ever since I saw that movie I was looking forward to his next work. < br / > < br / > I hope you enjoy the film. Thanks for I guess I do though.",1
But that'just the funny part. The rest is strictly suspense and action. There is a foreign man who is selling and making extremely dangerous guns. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz.,1
"< br / > < br / > Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. Showtime doesn't strain to be original. There are chases, shootouts and explosions. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. You know what? Not any more.",1
"And, to all those with criticisms : this is a comedy. I am not saying this lightly. And, please, don't be so negative. It is light, funny, and very restful. I simply love this movie. I am aware of all ( or most ) of the deficiencies but I love it.",1
"Rating 8 of 10 stars. < br / > < br / > Murphy really shines in this one. Man, that was hilarious! Rene Russo is also great as the TV producer. I was psyched to see the pairing of Murphy and De Niro...",1
"But then, that's how unrealistic the comedy is. I never knew that, "" he muses, impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced. One of his more amusing moments is his reaction to Skelton explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans. """,1
I personally recommend this. And very well done.,1
"If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you pretty much know what to expect, because what you see here is what you get. '< br / > < br / > Her boss likes the idea and gives Chase the green light. And who do you suppose they're going to come up with for that?

This is a funny movie.,1
He is good in comedy.,1
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. Those are by far the funniest scenes.",1
I cannot understand why so many people did not like this film.,1
Good show based on true story.,1
!,1
"I was surprised. What a remarkable story, and once again it is - unlike many stories that claim to be - totally true. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AS TO PLOT!!!!! I absolutely hate the idea of made for television films. It ` s very well written, directed and acted, especially by Sean Pertwee ( Why isn ` t that guy a big name star?",1
Altogether a riveting film which will have audiences biting their nails and gritting their teeth wondering how such dire events could take place in modern civilization. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families.,1
"This is a fun film with a neat cast. Eve Arden is Wally's agent, who arranges a date for him and Grey to make sure his contract is renewed.",1
"Anyway, it's fascinating reading. The crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence. I also, as usual, loved Omar Epps.",1
"I always remember someone who had The drama starts when the stowaways enter the vast cavernous holds of the ship. So far normal. While this goes on Suchet in the comfort of his well appointed cabin gets drunk unaware of the mayhem 3 decks below. This ship seemed to have a vast armoury. Africa is notorious for stowaway pickups. I question the use of guns in this film. Think of the train drivers who took Jews to Auschwitz, the clerks who worked out those train timetable. The crew pop ashore for a little intercourse and inebriation.",1
The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch.,1
Give this movie a try. < br / > < br / > I know the real names were changed but still the experience is the same.,1
"Anyway, if anyone knows the real "" real story "", I would appreciate you sharing!",1
A lot of emotional nuance. Highly recommend.,1
TV churns out dozens of true - crime movies every year. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame. You won't regret it.,1
I LOVE IT! Especially Jacinta Stapleton!,1
"Like a few people I know, I came in late on'Stingers'; not until 2000. Gary could measure up to any British or US actor in a similar series. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The cast changes occasionally but each change brings something new and fresh.",1
And cast it with actors exclusively lacking in singing or dancing talent?,1
"Watch one, watch them all. Wartime is funny that way I guess, and so then again are these movies.",1
"I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. You can be critical of the acting the singing, and dialog but that't not what I look for when I go to a movie. This may be very simplistic, but really, wouldn't it be nice.",1
The movie is excellent. I have seen it.,1
I also recently finished the novel upon which it is based.,1
I love this movie.,1
"Moreover, THE THINGS I WILL NOT MISS is good duet with a strong melody. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. The film has a prestigious cast and a gifted director and cinematographer. Why shouldn't Shangri - La be a slightly goofy place? is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David.",1
What was so great about her? I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon.,1
"The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it'excellent. ( Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite. )",1
< br / > < br / > ( Oh would I love to see it again too! ),1
Just doesn't fit. Michael York is lost here.,1
"Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. @ you won't be sorry. Boy was I right. JP Really, This movie should be released to DVD.",1
Veidt is excellent as evil Jones. < br / > < br / > Well worth your time. Also fun to see Eve Arden in a small role. Rutherford and Grey are lots of fun as Skelton's girlfriends. He writes the murder mysteries and as'The Fox'solves them.,1
"HE really enjoyed it, and - after trying to block out all the negative prejudices I obviously had about the film - so did I. Vocally, Kellerman's duet with Olivia Hussey on "" The Things I Will Not Miss "" is excellent. Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography / set / songs etc. It isn't even especially camp.",1
Who would have known?,1
The cinematography is awesome.,1
It's about time for this to happen. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy.,1
This cinematography is excellent.,1
"I still watch from time to time. I went to the cinema in 1973 when the film was released, I was 11 at the time.",1
LOVED IT! !,1
Thank God. I don't see that much wrong with this movie.,1
"Expect some corny moments, few thrill, and an occasional laugh.",1
This was also Red's first starring role.,1
"It ends up being a lot of fun. The two - dimensional characters are so overly serious they actually become endearing, and the movie's silliness is infectious. * * * from * * * * However, the production is lush and the general handling strangely affecting. ).",1
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. It is about a land "" far away from it all "" where "" living things have room to grow. "" < br / > < br / > I have been searching for the video for years. - LostHorizon. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.",1
I wish a director's cut on DVD was available. ! I liked it then and still see it while I listen to the music on my LP.,1
"He never misses a step in his "" Question Me An Answer "" and rightly so... he was totally at home as Harry. To the first, try to not judge and just enjoy the message. The first is that of Bobby Van. < br / > < br / > There are some good musical moments in the film. Take this and compare it to reality and you get a film that falls short of a goal. He is a song - and - dance - man from way back and, honestly, the only one in the cast that was truly talented and experienced for musicals.",1
So why isn't this on DVD?!,1
Great movie watch! ! It was very well directed.,1
"All and all a great movie that I would recommend. I wonder why certain actors make it and certain ones don't. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing.",1
I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again.,1
"Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. But there are a few plot holes. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. By the time the cops find him, he has killed her.",1
"George Saunders is a forger who steals a rare copy of Hamlet, killing a guard in the process. One of the forgeries is sold to a man working for the Nazi's. A good little film that's worth searching out.",1
It'going to kick some azz.,1
Check it out. It'just about the best geezer - rock out there.,1
"< br / > < br / > Still, this video is more than just the music. B. "" It's still a small flaw so it'not too big deal. This is at least very close to a perfect video publication.",1

"< br / > < br / > The lyrics of many of Holly's songs are pretty adolescent ; read the lyrics for "" Peggy Sue "" or "" Oh Boy! "" We will never know if he would have ultimately catapulted his early success into a business brand like The Rolling Stones. This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly ( 1936 - 1959 ) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. and you will see what I mean. Members of other bands like Keith Richards and Don Everly also offer opinions and stories and there is footage of old Holly performances. < br / > < br / > The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs.",1
"I also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies. I had a difficult time distinguishing at what point in Buddy's life certain events were happening. I'm torn on my views of this film. But others.. ouch. It startled even me, But I had never truly listened to his music. They wore me out! First, I'm a huge Buddy Holly fan. I don't know why I noticed it.. but I did.",1
"I saw this ( video 2000 ) years ago and would love to see it on DVD. Much later I found out our family moved into our new house on - yes, February 3rd, 1959.",1
"But most of all, I remember the music.",1
Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly.,1
"What a bunch of ingrates! He remains one of the greatest singers in history. Whether it's "" That'll Be Day "", "" Peggy Sue "", or another one of his songs, they still sound great after all these years.",1
"As a long - time Holly fan and rocker, so do I.",1
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock'n'roll. < br / > < br / > Busey was nominated for an Oscar. A well produced soundtrack became a multi - million seller.,1
I like this film and believe that you will too.,1
"They hated rock - n - roll, that turned Holly off big time. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. 5 STARS! That's what I call tolerance. GOD BLESS YOU GARY BUSEY! When he went to Tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. That really makes him good! He does have a spitting image to the man. He stuck to his kinder ways. That's one of the reasons he didn't act like Elvis.",1
"How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Gary Busey saved this film. I've got to say it. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly?",1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. He died.,1
"It would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other. However, it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to Buddy's wife after his death. It gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the story, and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the story. The testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of Buddy. ).",1
Best performance = Gary Busey.,1
or any of the other popular singers of this generation? What a great film! What a difference in the stars from the 50's to today music stars.,1
A fun little fright flick. The moody score by Jerry Mosely likewise hits the shuddery spot. Radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave.,1
I don't see what else one could want from film.,1
"It's just a fad. Gary Busey attempts to capture this aspect of Buddy's persona. Rave A year later Buddy Holly stepped in to give the King some competition. The heyday for 3 - D was in the early 1950's. Yet another example where just a little research would have sufficed to make the story more believable. Certainly Buddy's parents were supportive of his musical career. """,1
"It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. The DJ has been playing "" The kids love it and the parents hate it. Busey finds that spark and ignites it, his passion is clear and infectious. This leads to the funniest scene in a film filled with humorous moments.",1
"Not. It was a fantastic experience. I'm glad to have participated in a great film of day. I also had my first "" date "" on film. Woo hoo! Fun stuff. They must have played those songs 20 times.",1
"The ending could have been real downer, but they didn't let it be. Busey not only sings like Holly, he's a dead ringer for him in the looks department. Almost every single he put out was a hit.",1
< br / > < br / > It doesn't to be rich to be a visionary film. < br / > < br / > And this is!,1
Where do I start. We see no scenes of this family in the US. Do I say how great the cinematography is.,1
"This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. I wonder if this was to save money?",1
"An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery. < br / > < br / > It was a strange, but enjoyable film. I don't know if his last film has been released. She was fantastic in the role, by way.

"In my opinion, the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film. This film promises much but delivers little. 0 when equated with the IMDb scale.

"Here's an idea : if you live in a college town, see if you can lobby for it to show up in campus film festival. This film played in Lexington KY for 7 days.",1
This is a film notable for what is not shown as much as for what is.,1
"Nuovomondo "" was a great experience. There are many great sequences in this movie. ).",1
"The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World. < br / The Old World is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.",1

Nuovomondo ( 2006 ) "" ( shown in the U. S. as "" The Golden Door "" ) was written and directed by Emanuele Crialese. Not this movie - - we get a sense for life below decks, and it isn't charming. There must be some symbolism there, but I couldn't make sense of it. Still, large screen or small screen, it's worth seeking out.

"The boat ride is imagined as rather dull which surely it was much of the time. < br / > < br / > They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over. One is that the rivers run with milk, an image which is depicted in the movie to poetic, impressionistic effect.",1

Lucy cannot board the boat for America without male escort.,1
I give the show 10.,1
"And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. Real poetry, real humor, real tenderness, real drama, real beauty. Francesco Cabras This is Christmas time!",1

"Furthermore, Miyazawa's devotion to science was also nicely portrayed. < br / > < br / > I though this film was very well done. Otherwise the animation, plot and dialog were all wonderful and heartfelt. < br / > < br / > The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully.",1
I'll make this brief. This was a joy to watch.,1

"The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. The film received poor reviews and only made $ 16, 000 in the box office. Head was written by Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson while they were allegedly high on the Mary - Jane. Basically, one to four of The Monkees lurch from scene to scene without any rhyme or reason. < br / > < br / > Head really has no plot.",1

"Well, there really isn't one, as many have said. < br / > < br / > The plot? ( 10 / 10 ) Its a shame that the film found no audience.

"Hey, hey, they're the Monkees, and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around! The other three Monkees only acted in it. No problem! < br / > < br / > In the end, even their deaths did not set them free. < br / > < br / > The Monkees, however, never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are. They did it through the power of their music.",1
< br / > < br / > Almost laugh : as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one - minute TV commercial about dandruff! Pretend it's not happening : when the Monkees commit group suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge! Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s. Listen : as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father! Witness : futile protests against the Vietnam War leap out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear! It is bewildering to discover that they blamed failure of this film on bad promo.,1
Nicholson was in several of these gangs. < br / > < br / > Who cares if it is a bad movie? It is a common technique. < br / > < br / > Jack writes. It is bad because it took risks. Whole cultures are thus swept along. Think Sean Penn and Jack.,1
"They want everything explained and all questions answered in the finale. Well sorry, if that's what you're wanting, this is not the movie for you. To complain about "" Head "" is like complaining about a dream you've had that you felt you could not understand. Brilliance indeed. < br / > < br / > Think of the film being like a dream. < br / > < br / > It seems that most people who disliked this film are wanting to watch a film with primarily a clear plot. and "" Long Title : Do I Have To Do This All Over Again? "" And just when I think I've figured out something in the film, it's answer is destroyed once I watch the film again.",1
"In a way, it was to be their swan song and they were determined to let it all hang out. Basically, it's a crazy, mixed up pastiche of various, unrelated sequences. Yes, they had plenty of help. Let the critics be damned. In short, it was a classic, cleverly conceived and well crafted example of late'60s experimental cinema. < br / > < br / > Unfortunately, "" Head "" came too late in Monkees career. < br / > < br / > There is no plot as such.",1
"Get one thing straight : "" Head "" is not The Monkees TV show. To many, frustrating. The movie was a deliberate attempt at market repositioning. Is he lesser or better the man? "" I am... proud of'Head ', "" Mike Nesmith has said.",1
Micky Dolenz is absolutely hiious. I don't know how many times this has happened to me. I can't believe he didn't have a second life as a comic actor after this film.,1
"It'a shame, because there was a lot of talent, both musically and otherwise, in The Monkees. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. < br / > < br / > Head has nothing like a conventional story.",1
"The story is predictably comfortable, with the Warner Brothers support team in fine form. ), and Bernard Punsly ( as Milt ). < br / > < br / > The boxing scenes are nicely staged. Although his manager killed the man, Mr. Garfield is blamed.",1
I Love this show and I love Philly!! Give this show a shot! David Morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role.,1
"Something special. A true piece of ensemble acting. Lou Gossett, great.",1
I loved this movie. He character was blamed. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie.,1
Lots of wonderful characters. Just his face. They even show some swimming abilities. Too bad.,1
"Very good 1939 film where John Garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder. While the ending is good, you want to see Garfield go back to N. Y. to proclaim his innocence.",1
"ill have to point out that i have only seen 2 john Garfield movies, this one and body and soul. this was directed by famed director Busby Berkley who directed timeless classics like 42nd street, goldiggers of 1933, and 35, footlight parade and many others. i thought he was a very good actor.",1
"Strange, as he always was such a reliable actor. She plays well off Garfield. < br / > < br / > A very good film that deserves greater attention 8 / 10. Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers. 'he brings'natural'to the screen.",1
Garfield and the Kids are at their best and this is a film sure to please all but pickiest of viewers.,1
Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? Another enjoyable Warner flick.,1
"00 of the $ 10, 000. Garfield who was only 26 at the time brought the best out of everyone in the movie. Johnnie now Jack Dorney travels the rails from New York down to Arizona ending up at the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm where most of the film takes place.",1
A police chase ends with a fiery car crash. Manager and girl are dead and unrecognizable. But he's also presumed dead. And the whiskey. He becomes a mentor and pal to - The Dead End Kids.,1
Humor is also present in the strip poker game as the Dead End brats fleece a rich kid. A beautiful film.,1
This is breezy highly entertaining drama with an excellent cast. Most notable of these is the beautiful Billy Halop who has some very moving moments. ).,1
"Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist.",1
"He pesters his boss to hand over the closed case to him, and is given the assignment to get him out of town and out of the way. < His character is Monty Phelan, and he has a pretty good hunch that the body in the car crash wasn't Johnny. It's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you weren't expecting it.",1
If anyone is aware of its availability please inform me.,1
That part is very exciting. < br / > < br / > The combat gets better as the film unravels. The widescreen ( Shaw Scope! ),1

Chucky 3 sucked. It's just that.,1
Very good direction.,1
The new Chucky look was great and Tiffany was very cute. !,1
!,1
He is one intense actor!,1
"In this one he has a female doll companion, hence the name.",1
"Very inventive! BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave.",1
Great movie.,1
"Lots of guilty pleasure fun and silliness. This is totally different from all other films in the series. I always come back "".",1
Bring on See Of Chucky! Great ending!,1
All up even if your not a Child'Play fan give this one a go. Together they go on a journey to find an object.,1
? !,1
5 < br / > < br / > i've already heard that they're planning a Son of Chucky. the first Child's Play was an original and effective little horror movie. ( i should add that she is also a fantastic actress as well. ),1
"! It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!",1
"Bring it on! ! Here's how I rank the series : 1, 4, 2, 3. That was a great gore scene!!!!! And the ending was so bizarre and shocking it made me s * % @ my pants.",1
"And, trust me, the whole time you're laughing, it's laughing back at.",1
"After all, you barely see her play poker anymore. to regain this pendant buried with Chucky's human corpse. And it contains the best subtitle / tagline : "" Chucky Gets Lucky. "" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for'Star Trek : Voyager.",1
"< br / > < br / > Unfortunately for poor Tiff, the reanimated maniac shows no interest in marriage, and so she traps him in a cage, with a bride doll for company. Sexy murderess Tiffany ( Jennifer Tilly ) still yearns for a life of wedded bliss with ex - boyfriend, crazed killer Charles'Chucky'Lee Ray. Kevin Yagher's impressively expressive doll effects also go a long way to making the film such a success.",1
< br / > < br / > 7 / 10. I thought it made movie stand out more.,1
##REAT MOVIE! It was a great movie!,1
"I like "" Hack. """,1
This is a good film for die - hard Chucky fans.,1
It'll be a hoot! < br / > < br / > 6.,1
"Well worth seeing. I give it a 9. and the lines and situations are actually quite funny. John Ritter has nice cameo too as a sheriff. Chucky ( the murderous doll from "" Child's Play "" and 2 crappy sequels ) is dead. The movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second ( seriously - - how could it? )",1
"While Tiffany takes a bath Chucky escapes, electrocutes her & using that book brings her back to life in the shape of a female doll dressed as a bride. There Tiffany stitches & staples Chucky ( voiced by Brad Dourif ) back together again & using a'voodoo for dummies'book brings him back to murderous life. The script by Don Mancini is great fun, very fast moving, highly entertaining & references plenty of other horror film with good affection.",1
"Chucky recaptures Jade and forces her to get his amulet. Thinking he has been set up, he confronts them about it.",1
"No time is wasted. Too bad there don't seem to be any real Putney Swopes in the world. Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot.",1
It was that good. Still worth it.,1
"In that sense, the movie has indeed dated. Forty years later, it's still a hard movie to get a consistent handle on. Thus, the movie's also about the allures of capitalism.",1
I love this show. David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry.,1
"Without even removing the body from the boardroom, they begin a paper ballot to elect the next chairman. The more I think about the movie, the more it grows on me. I didn't understand a lot of things about "" Putney Swope "", but for the most part, I liked it.",1
"Imagine the times. Yes, that's right. This movie got better with time.",1
The editing is only so - so. The script is priceless. What Plot?? Keep Scratching!! How Many Syllables Mario? I also see a little bit of Monty Python in this. Nothing is sacred. This film is not about PLOT! You have to see them within the context of the film. The acting is above average. Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release.,1
"And don't forget those side characters, dear God. For all its moments that are rough and crude, it's unforgettable.",1
"I saw this movie in its brief run in "" art house "" cinema in'69. The part of "" Arab "" was particularly priceless.",1
"I d rather watch this than "" To Sir With Love "" any old day!",1
"< br / > < br / > Favorite parts, the commercials. a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. Thank you Prince. ( Good filmmaking, disjointed script. )",1
"Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.",1
A real masterpiece. Hilarious.,1
"< br / > < br / > All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now. Its humor is as funny, and its message as strong.",1
!,1
"Interesting, off - beat movie.",1
"And their commercials will follow later, like them or not. out of 10. Now it's a rather motley crew he has and despite that they somehow manage to be successful while raking in the cash.",1
"This movie will eat your brain, it's too good. One word - genius. "" My name is Rufus. """,1
Jarl and Moodysson are part of an dying breed of political film makers.,1
"I think not. But are their beliefs of having the possibility of changing the society realistic? It is a great documentary that is not propaganda, because it is not shown as what they say is right. This documentary focuses on the happenings in Gothenburg 2001.",1
In that they just listen to each other and report what others report.,1
"In Sweden, a democracy, 2001?",1
I cannot recommend this enough really. I could really go on and on about the film. And you can really feel that in this.,1
Kudos to the film - maker for that.,1
"And make no mistake,'mainly ETC. that is the overriding question of this film. We meet them on the morning of april 8, 1994 the day kurt cobain committed suicide.",1
"As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Excellent soundtrack, with songs you don't hear on the radio. This film made me do all three.",1
An honest an original piece of work. I saw this film at a small screening.,1
! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Grease has truly become an American icon.,1
Hate to see it end.,1
The person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway. What's Broadway without the acting? This show is very underrated.,1
"If the entire cast was green and fresh then I believe that would have compromised the casting process by which producers choose their talent. < br / > < br / > They sang songs from the movie ( "" Hopelessly Devoted, "" et al ) because these songs will be included in the new production.",1
I won't say more because it is better for you have to enter the story as it unfold. I just saw this film and I recommend it.,1
The facial expressions are incredible. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. My husband and I watched this last night...,1
"This film is better than Unfaithful, but not a masterpiece by any means.",1
Pity its being aired on ITV 3. I've just watched'Misty Blue'( episode 38 ). Lovin.,1
"He starts to understand that what he superficially though was OK ( his marriage ) in reality was a control game played by him on his wife. < br / > < br / > Is she to blame more than him? No paperboard heroes or cold, omnipotent, know - all characters. Maybe. But we must remember that she is running with her feet for the first time. I really liked this movie. Unless you are a jealous, prehistoric, crime - of - passion inclined, possessive and mentally instable individual. The last scene, when James - despite all the things happened < br / > < br / > A really good movie.",1
So what on EARTH did Emily Watson's ( Anne ) character SEE in him???? Give us break. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. WHAT tragedy? Who was I kidding?,1
"How on earth can people give this movie a low rating. Unbelievable. this cheeky woman, here? I want to see more of her.",1
"I believe that is why she undertook that effort. As well, was he indeed good, and / or was he attempting to redeem self by allowing her to go with Rupert. Love it.",1
"As it is, it's tremendously sad. Well, that's just it, "" Ann says. "" It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett ) husband. What if the father had done it? If Ann were in James'place, it would be shattering. I am f _ _ _ ing Bule. "" Of course, James then isn't so eager to rush to the police. < br / > < br / > There are separate lies - James that his marriage is happy, Ann's The chair. She gets life in prison.",1
"I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. Even though he truly loves her, he is boring his wife to death. Tom Wilkinson is perfect as the husband. The bad boy is far more exciting. That passion is reborn by the character deftly played by Rupert Everett. This guy appears to be a cad from the word, "" Go. """,1
< br / > < br / > By the way there are some very funny lines regarding certain situations. The entire production is first rate. Now this is the sort of film we used to get weekly.,1
"Tom Wilkinson, is a solicitor, who tries to protect his wife. Sounds like she wants revenge. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. O well, the marriage ended anyway. < br / > < br / > This all becomes convoluted.",1
"So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England.",1
"Yeah, well you got one... "" What can I say about Hack... what a man among men. Hey, I didn't order no cab! "" The show was superb, I laughed, I cried, I smiled... all in the same episode. """,1
"< br / > < br / > SPOILERS BELOW. Not in a pathetic way. At times he needed to leave. Dump her. My first reaction to the puppy - dog - eyed Emily was "" It's Over. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. Bad riddance. """,1
"Beneath it all, human frailty not excluded, they meant well. It's not sensational or complex as another film "" Where Truth Lies "" 2005. This is a British film you just might not want to miss. Contradictions, indeed. She is the decency undeterred. < How true these words are.",1
Did they just not have marketing team? Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed.,1
"A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Recommended viewing.",1
"Just down the road is the aristocratic the Hon. His primary focus was on getting his characters right, and by and large he has succeeded. Bill's. He also kept it short ; the running time is only 80 minutes. The part seems underdeveloped. Anne is some years younger but they are childless.",1
A well written screenplay. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors.,1
That can wear a lot of people out. Maybe you tell lies. Please give British films like this a chance.,1
"I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The ending is perfect, so in tune with real adult life.",1
"SEPARATE LIES is such an elegant, intelligent and thought provoking film and I could have watched Tom Wilkinson forever on the screen. Bravo, Tom!",1
"'. They attend social outings and meet, among others, William Bule ( Rupert Everett ), the passively lazy wealthy neighbor. It is a film whose effect relies on the cast portraying the varyingly benign / malignant characters and it is here that Fellowes'directorial choices are superb. When James returns home he sees a scratch on William's Range Rover and suspects William to be perpetrator.",1
It seems that Hack has been described as un - realistic... but that's what TV is.,1
It was so well executed.,1
Can he no wrong?! This is a stunning movie. GO AND SEE IT!,1
"But the part I disliked most was the death of the bride to be. The reason was never explained, nor did it serve any purpose.",1
"This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. < br / > < br / > For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself. Intentional or is this just her way of acting? Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. < br / > < br / > 7 / 10 At least when compared to different Columbo movies. < br / > < br / > The characters are good and it helps that it features Martin Landau in a double role.",1
Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one.,1
Coincidence? Or Steven Bochco joke?,1
"< br / > < br / > "" Just one more question "" - The acting? It is close to 8 / 10. Peter Falk is very good as usual. < br / > < br / > It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.",1
"Other than that wrinkle, this episode fits in well with others of the series.",1
"Thats how Good that Movie is. Do you liked "" Dead Man don't wearlaid ""?",1
"< br / > < br / > legendary film from the 80's especially for those interested in Austrian or German - speaking cinema. ). """,1
6,1
Another good job! Is this still a good story YES. This is a very good show.,1
"< br / > < br / > Not that this film would not be surreal or quirky. In other words - this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a pun. "".",1
"so, can't really compare.",1
"NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p * * * off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. Phaedra Video's DVD sleeve features a critic quote calling film "" A paranoid street crime freakout! "" ).",1
"For me this is a good series. ! I think they survived, I forget?",1
The show start out with the boat. And they get caught. Desmond was i it.,1
The ending is not so understandable.,1
"Are Locke, Eko and Desmond dead? as the hatch destructed around them.",1
"So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. The melting of the clock and Locke's "" I was wrong "" are unforgettable moments. * * * 1 / 2 out of 4.",1
Something has clearly changed.,1
All of it is fake. Center of the earth? So there was another abnormality? once you'gone. Set up by her daddy.,1
Good job. The writers of lost have outdone themselves. He will have to if he wants to stay alive.,1
The story was told perfectly. This was a great way to end the show.,1
"And a good cliffhanger at the very end. I hope there will be only 3 seasons. And still, there'new material as if all the holes in the picture were not enough. Twins?? There was also lots of actions in the very last episode. Yeah!! That was just an example of how I was frustrated watching those episodes. < br / > < br / > Let's go back to the last 2 episodes.",1
"Anyway, I hope we'll get answers we need, in season 3. They're geniuses. Referring to Jeffrey Lieber, Lindelof & Abrams. My vote is nine. It's got everything in it, really. Can't wait!",1
Yeah Right!,1
"< br / > < br / > BTW, great episode. I hope all the unanswered questions will be answered.",1
"The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. After the destruction of the hatch, the island is not isolated any more, and other ships / airplanes are going to arrive 4. Buts lets see about that.",1
My vote is ten. < br / > < br / > This episode is one of the best of the Second Season.,1
"However, Mr. Eko's resolve to continue pressing "" the button "" is surprisingly strong. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront "" The Others "".",1
10 out of 10. This movie is BEAUTIFUL.,1
"< br / > < br / > And, in addition to his. 475 Magnum. Well, that is something. Death Wish 5 is the best one.",1
"yeah, right. there's not much import to this film, its more escapism than anything.",1
!,1
"genius. Highly recommended, if you hate this movie you're crazy. And once again Bronson is a bad ass.",1
go out and not rent but buy this movie its worth money trust me. Deff. The lines just keep on coming in the movie.,1
The villains are hilariously bad. Crew?,1
I also really liked the soundtrack to this movie. It's enjoyable watching Bronson ( Paul Kersey ) rid the streets of these thugs. It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.,1
"3. The weird sound effect after Kersey says "" Cash! "" Mandy! Ha! It's so evil sounding. Terrible acting!",1
< br / > < br / > I gives this 9 / 10,1
"Gavan O'Herlihy also did his job very good. However, Death Wish 3 was the very interested film. On the next issue, Violence was used pervasively in the film. Kersey decided to set the war with Franker and his gang. This movie used the very straightedge way to tell the story. She could have more role to appear. Due to the chance given by Insp.",1
"Gabin perfectly incarnates the aging French playboy hero. Arnoul is a cute redhead who holds her own in the dance numbers, except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously used. Even when Nini experiences heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song, the lighting is bright and flat, no shadows intruding. The movie tells a fictionalized story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub.",1
"This is great stuff. This movie was great. Rather, you want to see Kersey in action and the storyline just juice it up.",1
"The'climax'is just a laugh riot. Of course, with him it was one shot - one kill with his elephant handgun LOL. The soundtrack is so funny, I laugh every time I hear it. LOL. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. < br / > < br / > - It's apparent that Kersey is all but used to losing loved ones... when his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates. It's so bad it's actually good lol. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.",1
Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time.,1
"Bronson does it all in this film. He goes into the dentistry business. If you want advice on dating, its here.",1
"One of the most magnificent movies ever made. All in all, a true classic.",1
"< br / > < br / > Is this film violent? ! catch it on the six o'clock news "". Tons of non - stop action!",1
A line only Bronson can truly make work. The violence is over the top. It ain't Spielberg and it ain't art.,1
"You can tell that the penny pinching Cannon group spent a lot of money on this one. The first film may be the most technically well made, but this one is the most fun. Charlie has never been more intense or super cool than in this one. Golan and Globus made this film for Bronson fans, not for the critics, and it works. In any case, this movie was no more violent than any other movie made during this time. We demand that Charles Bronson is back in his most famous role. In my opinion, this is by far the best film of the series and my favorite movie ever.",1
!,1
"If that Kersey never even says her first name through the entirety of the film. I think it definitely is. I like chicken. "" And that's giving Delta Force a lot of credit.",1
The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan.,1
"Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Nor is the fact that he won a Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, the D. F. C., and the Navy Cross. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see. The details of Dengler's romantic life are too Hollywood and staid an aspect to interest Herzog.",1
"His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships. Job well done! It helps us to understand his emotions, pain, and plight. Oh what a surprise!",1
"< br / > < br / > This is a requirement to see. This film, for about 80 minutes, have discovered a new dimension of storytelling. What do I call this apparently new sense.",1
"< br / > < br / > Dengler is a fascinating and extremely likable person. Thanks to Herzog for ( re ) introducing him to us. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this to his fans and to those who enjoy documentaries. It's a very interesting and well executed film.",1
We laugh and cringe and are amazed at this man. Where else for this man but America?,1
What attracts a man to military service? You will never forget this story - - or man.,1
"Luckily, he is a master storyteller. With documentary films, the question of realism always crops up.",1
! This film is a must see!!,1
"In a way director Werner Herzog sets up a central question, in a manner of speaking, to why Dieter is like this. And why shouldn't he be after the life he's lived?",1
The musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch. ).,1
Very Impressing. I didn't'like'it. Wow.,1
"Harrowing for us to watch, I can't imagine what he felt as he was bound again. Herzog introduced the film and did an hour long Q & A afterward. I had the opportunity to see this last evening at a local film festival. It should serve as a lesson to us all.",1
< br / > < br / > SEE IT!,1
That is it. Dieter manages to explain what happened. Back problems? This film is excellent! He can take no more. Fear of watching documentary movies? The Vietcong men react surprised.,1
"This is one of those movies that can resonate with you for a lifetime. Reviewers sometimes even claim that Herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong they are.",1
"The terrible truth about Donald and his wife Joan hits him like a bolt out of the blue and leaves him speechless, just like it did Joan earlier. At office Donald get a panicked call from Elsie telling him to come over to her place right away about something very important. both are finally planing to get married and raise a family. Telling Elsie that she's wrong about him being infected and that she should seek medical attention Elsie shoots herself as Donald is just about to leave. Damaged Lives "" is far ahead of it's times in educating it's viewers about the dangers Venereal Deasise.",1
* cackles * OMG! That hair!!! I love ham! He is young and so innocent in this film. SEE IT NOW! You'll be bowled over!,1
Harris'Sally preens and prances about and growls out a very lascivious laugh. Ron Randell plays the caddish Clive but seems a tad loud. These two characters couldn't be more unalike. This is the source material for the famous musical CABARET. Lee Seidl is funny as the landlady. Harris is perhaps stagy but she's also quite good as the madcap and maddening Sally. She also acts circles around the boring Harvey.,1
"It is one of the great cinematic performances of the 1950s. Larry is so funny at portraying a wimpish hypochondriac. He adored his little girl Domino, now alas also tragically dead.",1
"It was long, but I didn't want it to end. It is a visual delight and a great entertainment. The recently produced Moulin Rouge pales by comparison.",1
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.,1
"When he goes political, he still has something to say. This special is the transmutation completed. It is a little tragic. Anyway. George isn't George anymore. He had a certain cynicism that always appealed to me. The last 25 minutes is the best this special has to offer. His observations are not cutting edge anymore and seem more Andy Rooney than Lenny Bruce.",1
"< br / > < br / > Editing is very good. Or Hell. HAHA, just joking, don't take it serious! It's not a best - of... but it's really amusing. It's only to have a great time!",1
"A fond farewell to a true great icon. Again making perfect sense. I always loved his observational humor. He really made you think. You can't do it! They keep bringing back to you! """,1

"< br / > < br / > It is a privilege for ANY Carlin fan to at least see ( if not own a copy ) of this particular show. ! He was still fast moving, and with great timing, even at 70!",1
"It's Bad for Ya really showcases more of George Carlin's talents. It is a shame that we lost him this past year, but his comedy will forever live on. He really is still as sharp as a tack.",1
"It'skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is NOT going to be "" fine "". It might be a stretch saying this as a die - hard Carlin fan, but the material, both written and as performed, in It's Bad for Ya is some of the best late - era material yet. < br / > < br / > Going from the topic of death ( how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book? And funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching Back in Town or'Diseased'the first time.",1
"Tim Blake Nelson was also good. The DVD also contains the music video for that song. When you live in the city all your life, it's hard to get accustomed to films of this nature. But all apologies aside, I found the characters fun and quirky. That surprised me!",1
It was hilarious!,1
"His prospects rise and fall with every coital journey he takes. He's all about the game, except - - for his pointy thing. Warner Baxter's "" Julian Marsh "" is a director who suffers for his art and is unappreciated. He uses his charm and the prospect of money to lure Nini to studying dancing so that she may go on the stage. Jean Gabin's "" Danglard "" keeps running afoul of genital politics, but when he talks about the show he is more like Knute Rockne than like Julian Marsh.",1
"It's just great. O Brother does that and then some. John Goodman is my favorite bit character as Big Dan, perfect.",1
Interesting story and casting.,1

The Coen's strike again.,1

< br / > < br / > This is a great movie. < br / > < br / > Watch it.,1
10 / 10 The Coen's have made a magnificiant film again.,1
"The movie is set in the 1930's. Really the majority of the movie may seem random. But to finish this off, "" Brother, Where Art Thou? "" is a smart, funny, and a movie adventure that I wouldn't let pass up. The complete opposite as I was expecting.",1
I thought this movie was great!,1
"I simply loved this movie, folks. Is this southern enough? So does Shakespeare and Dante.",1
"10 / 10, for sure. John Goodman's appearance in the movie is hilarious. The soundtrack is great as well.",1
This film makes Clooney.,1
You gotta see movie! !,1
"Turturro and Nelson are flawless stumblebums. Holly Hunter plays his estranged wife. Toe tapping, knee slapping fun for the whole family. The Coen Brothers have done it again.",1
"I was into the movie right away. Soon the look is accompanied by the great, great music. < br / > < br / > You'll love it too, I promise.",1
But it's exactly what this picture is. But the rest of cast is superb too. Thats a very unlikely combination. But the true master performance in this movie comes from Tim Blake - Nelson. I left the cinema with a warmth in my heart.,1
chris w gal An easy evening's viewing.,1
"You get the sense that you're really there taking all this in. The cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role. I've shown it to several friends and they all want my copy, that says it all, the movie is that good. A great deal of care was given in the sets, costumes and music of the period. Check it out for yourself.",1
"OBWAT is certainly those things, but it also has a heart as big as.. well.. as big as Mississippi. I don't think there is a performance that falls short of excellent from the entire cast. More comedy please George.",1
"Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. Still, I liked the film and now own a copy of it. This is a film that is out there. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo.",1
It is one of those films that you can watch over and over. The story is brilliant written.,1
The brothers Coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights!,1
"By the time it began, I had forgotten what movie I was there to see. Thank goodness for the Coen Brothers. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was this clever. I was surprised in more ways than one.",1
"Absolutely brilliant! Throw in my interest in what London was like back in the late 70s and you have the basic premise for my version of TV heaven! It truly came across as grimy, tatty and down - at - heel. < br / > < br / > As for the story and the acting, well top marks obviously go to Nigel Hawthorne as The Vampire.",1
And found none. I enjoyed it very much along with danger UXB.,1
Watch it!,1
< br / > < br / > I hope you get to see it.,1
"8 / 10. It's hard not to fall head - over - heels in love with that girl. I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.",1
I was delighted to see this gem of a film available on DVD.,1
"Everything makes sense and serves purpose in what happens to Joe in this one day. You think wrong. Flesh "" is hard to describe with a solid summary because, well, there basically isn't a plot.",1
"But the use she wants to put the bread to is to pay for her new girlfriend's abortion. A heap of human flesh lies asleep on a red pillow. This is the hunk of naked meat that is "" Little Joe "", a New York hustler who lives with his bisexual wife and baby child.",1
"After all he has uncovered more than his soul. The jarring sound of every change in camera angle. What purpose could it serve? Snap, crackle, pop! < br / > < br / > There is a scene in the film that is remarkably effective. There is no sound, no dialogue. Or could it be that this approach was intentional? Surely not. Joe stark naked is crouching on floor feeding crumbs of cake to his little baby. One thing is certain, Joe is uninhibited when it comes to disrobing for sex or posing for an artist. What on earth were they up to in the editing room?",1
"I guess that answer basically sums up my all - around feelings for the film. That is, despite it's in - ignorable flaws, on a whole it does work very well. In other ways, it is undeniably an amateurish, unfocused result of junkies self - indulgently fooling around with a camera.",1
"I was a junior in high school when "" Flesh "" hit the big screens, but had the good fortune to see it at midnight movie houses in NYC just two years later. Essentially the story concerns itself with the exploits surrounding one day in the life of a street - wise male hustler ( played by Joe Dallesandro ). < br / > < br / > Of special note to film buffs is that this film ( along with the remaining two of the trilogy ), had no script, per se. clicks "", "" flashes "", and dialogue literally cut off mid - sentence.",1
"When Dallesandro's eyes seem red and swollen, we can't tell if it's because he's drunk, ashamed, embarrassed, or all. ). One of the most sublime of American masterpieces, Morrissey opens the film by sexualizing Dallesandro, with his open mouth snoring on a pillow. It's also dreadfully funny ( "" I'm not talking to an empty bed, am I? "" We just see his face, then, flash, his body, flash, his naked rear. We wonder, is he coming off a heroin high?",1

"Good luck Rachael! After all, she is a television personality.",1
< br / > < br / > Rounding out the good points of this doc is a touching musical score with some excellent expressive string music. There is one of the most comical anti - visionary rants ever captured on camera. And expressiveness is a major point to be found in Kahn's architecture.,1
"Not good enough. One might expect them to burst into anger, but only the camera saves them from hostilities. The man was a sculptor on a grand scale who spoke of his craft in airy terms of silence and art. Many of Khan's contemporaries and collaborators also help flesh out the filmmaker's ghost - father. The funeral service, when the filmmaker was just a boy, was, shall we say, an unpleasant surprise. < br / > < br / > To be sure, Louis Kahn was a gifted architect, but "" architect "" is a cold word. Each of these children has visibly lost something. The answers Nathaniel Khan is looking for seem hollow.",1
i think the title of the movie describes it well. although some of that is covered in this film.,1
Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described. Gianni Esposito is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting Nini. This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties.,1
"< br / > < br / > The tragedy of the film is the broken families he left. It's more a study of a bastard son trying to find out who his biological father was, than anything about architecture. I rented this film because it was a documentary and highly rated.",1
"His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional. Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. Equally haunting is the sound track. The film was introduced by Daniel, and he was kind enough to do a question and answer session afterward.",1
Louis'passion was his art.,1
Nathanial Khan reads from the front page of the New York Times where his father is simultaneously praised as the best American architect alive and his death announced. I needed to know him.,1
"On March 17, 1974, a man is found dead in the toilets at Manhattan's Penn Station. It turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the greatest American architects of the twentieth century, Louis I. Kahn. In addition to his wife Esther, and their daughter, Sue Ann, Kahn was survived by two mistresses, Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng, and their two children. < br / > < br / > While celebrated as an architect, very little was known about his private life. It was worth it. "" All three families lived within miles of each other in suburban Philadelphia, but their paths never crossed until the funeral.",1
Perhaps there is salvation,1
He was an architect's architect. He had a vision and he never strayed from it. < br / > < br / > Louis Kahn was the father.,1
It's breathtaking. 4 stars. My Architect also covers the difficulty Louis Kahn had with getting his designs accepted.,1
"There are plenty of books and archived materials that have records of Louis Kahn's projects and buildings. In "" Heading West, "" we're at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies at La Jolla, California. Now at 80, Tyng's return with Nathaniel's film crew to the Bath House project at Trenton, New Jersey, was nostalgic. What a tribute to his father!",1
"< br / > < br / > The final sequence in Bangladesh totally made the film for me. < br / > < br / > I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work. Sometimes it seemed as though these people were telling Nathaniel how to feel about his father. < br / > < br / > think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what he was looking for.",1
"Excellent casting, scenery, sound - effects and music. But the Jean Renoir production is great. And a Jean Renoir nice tribute to his time, his friends, lovers, music and dances.",1
"The unsaid hovers over the conversation. < br / > < br / > One of his mistresses said he was "" accessible "" but that is never explored. < br / > < br / > It appears, in this case at least, the son is not the father of the man. < br / > < br / > 8 out of 10, beautifully filmed, genuine. A pity. Other comments by people who knew him well suffer the same fate.",1
"< br / > < br / > Many architects were interviewed by director, writer and project honcho Nathaniel Kahn, the architect's only son. He and his parents settled in Philadelphia where the talented youngster loved art and music. That inflexibility was the reason that while he drew wonderful plans for many buildings he built but a few. < br / > < br / > Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident.",1
"The murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys. < br / > < br / > While this film may not feature loads of gore, it does have two of Fulci's nastiest sequences to make up for it. Don't Torture a Duckling features an absolutely great Italian cast.",1
"This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's. A standout scene. Irrespective, she is hunted down by a lynch mob and chain - whipped while a car radio blasts out rock music.",1
"Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery. This is why "" Don't Torture a Duckling "" surprised me. I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films.",1
"It's more of a straight horror movie. < br / > < br / > 10 out of 10 kids. "" Fulci beats him with this one. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. The music is ridiculously perfect. The setting is perfect : an old Italian village.",1
"If anything, this adds even more potency to Fulci's message. Catholic guilt and grisly slayings are such a resonant combination. Composer Riz Ortolani bookends these carnage - filled scenes with ferocious reverberating string blasts. It is a deeply effective ending that has the capacity to leave viewer in a befuddled and disarmed torpor. < br / > < br / > Interestingly enough, Matera was also used as a stand - in for Jerusalem in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ.",1
< br / > < br / > The photography in this film is fantastic. What a surprise this film was. < br / > < br / > What went wrong Lucio?,1
Someone else? The rich girl? In no aspect does this detract from the positive attributes this movie delivers. The spastic voodoo witch?,1
"What I don't like is that it can be confusing at times, especially at the end. The acting is also pretty good and the photography is great. < br / > < br / > First of all I have to say that I'm a huge Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento fan.",1
< br / > < br / > Overall a fantastic and mature film from one of our great Italian horror directors. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development.,1
"Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino "" aka. "" The acting performances are among the best in Italian Horror cinema. Don't Torture A Duckling "" truly delivers cinematic perfection in every aspect, which makes it an absolute masterpiece of Italian Horror cinema. Bodies of little boys are found in rural Sicily.",1
"Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. This giallo does lend itself to becoming one of Fulci's more personal and substantive films, in that we actually get a fair influx of ideas from him.",1
"The twist near end provides good misdirection. This person kills little children. A legitimate theme undergirds the story. But this is no slasher film. Acting is generally average, though in a couple of cases, it's a bit overdone. Set in and near a poor working class town in the mountains of rural Italy, it's a story of madness.",1
"10 / 10 for me. This is a truly impressive, story and character - driven murder mystery that might well be the director's masterpiece.",1
"< br / > < br / > This is a remarkable film. It also contains a solid score as well as many creative camera movement courtesy or Lucio Fulci. It also contains some very biting commentary on the middle class and the Catholic Church. Don't Torture a Duckling "" hardly contains any gore, yet ranks as his best.",1
There are scenes designed to disturb anyone. What crazy reasoning he had. < br / > < br / > It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. She also tries to tempt the local priest. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?,1
"< br / > < br / > While not a traditional giallo film, Duckling has many of the genre's trademarks. The plot is well constructed, not easily figured out and the end conclusion is very satisfying. These three movies left me to conclude that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers. But my stubbornness prevailed and I had to check out more of his films. The authorities are clueless as to who's behind these crimes, especially after their prime suspect has been cleared.",1
I'm pretty sure they will.,1
"A surprisingly effective mystery, a good cast and imaginatively shot against an unusual rural setting. Everything just clicks. I think it's justly hailed as one of the director's most accomplished achievements. Originally, the film was titled even more absurdly, "" Don't Torture Donald Duck "", literally translated from its Italian title. Talk about your prime red herring.",1
"As typical with the giallo subgenre, the plot won't be fully revealed until the last few frames, but if you can hang in there long enough, this film pays off. In a small, picturesque Sicilian village, someone is brutally killing young, sexually curious boys. The acting, particularly Bolkan, is also very good.",1
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD.,1
This is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. 8.,1
"The film's bursts of violence compensate for the fact that there are no real scares or suspense to speak of. Oh... that title DOES eventually make perfect sense, too!",1
"Like a true mastermind, Fulci knows to find the right creepy tone for his film. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! Fulci also develops himself as a genius storyteller here. This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema!",1
< br / > < br / > You won´t know who the killer is until the last moments of the film. If only all the films he made after were like this. < br / > < br / > ( 10 out of 10 )... of course! This is Lucio Fulci at his best.,1
"In fact it beats out his later movies hands - down. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch? Please.... 9 out of 10 stars, see it! It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it.",1
Who is killing the young boys in town? This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself.,1
"Alas, we probably will never know.",1
that's why it earns an eight out of 10.,1
Final shot will haunt me for weeks. ).,1
"A very strange film, well written and portrayed. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit.",1
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully.,1
A well told story.,1
This movie is beautiful in all ways.,1
"My opinions don't flow with the majority in most cases. < br / > < br / > I bought into it wholeheartedly. I tend to lean toward the artsy, imaginative, and different.",1
To my surprise they did and did it VERY well.,1
"The exquisite cinematography, minimalist dialog, somewhat demented story which arguably hints at possible bestiality in about three scenes are what ultimately lead professional critics to pan the film as pretentious and overlong rubbish. french painter across the rugged, dangerous landscapes of the Gobi Desert.",1
Hope I can find on video.,1
"There's the Nile, and there's the sea! Passion In The Desert exemplifies spatial grander.",1
It is plain and simply worth money to pay for.,1
I don't agree with the person who said it's boring. There is also a nice touch of humor.,1
The cast is fantastic.,1
"They represent different jobs : a piper, a ballerina, a clown, a man in a tattered hat. Why are they there?",1
The Hunt 2. Coincidence? The Lonely 5.,1
It is claustrophobic and colorful. Most of the beauty of the episode is to lead up to that.,1
"None can figure it out. This uncertainty of what is going on allows the viewers to think it is an abstract drama. < br / > < br / > The title seems to be suggested by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, Pirandello's famous play. And the Major, going to the top of the line of figures does reach the entrance, and.... And the conclusion, whether planned as a spoof or not, is quite effective.",1
"In fact, Lady Ashmore ( Kerr ) is hiding him. Highly recommended.",1
"You have a military major, a female dancer, bag pipe player, a clown, and hobo who all awake together in the bottom of a wall and none know how they got there and they don't know who they are. Only in the end I don't want to spoil for those who haven't seen a surprise fall happens!",1
"< br / > < br / > This is a brilliant episode, beautifully written and acted.",1
< br / > < br / > But you will feel ambushed. < br / > < br / > This episode is spoiled in one sentence and is too good to spoil for any who have not seen it. Further comment of the series is unnecessary.,1
"Exactly what makes a good piece of writing into a classic. < br / > < br / > Unlike Pirandello, these characters don't even have a story. A bell intermittently rings ( perhaps also a Hemmingway allusion? ), increasing the agony of their incarceration. The newcomer to the group, a Major, is determined to escape, while the others are resigned to their fate. There is also an emphasis upon issues of personal insignificance.",1
nothing was made to fancy. but overall a good movie to see for those of u who are not readers.,1
"It is still good, but not fantastic.",1
? 10 / 10 Must - See The kids acted so well. But it sure did WOO me. This movie is sad. Tears dropped down my eyes.,1
It has a proper PG - 13 rating. I have not read the novel from which the film is based on. SPOILER ALERT - - The child rape scene is very well handled. < br / > < br / > All aspects of production are first rate.,1
worth the watch. tragic and touching. perfectly! which makes a great movie for me!,1
"< br / > < br / > The two are separated not only by class but also by ethnicity. Amir, a burgeoning writer, is a member of the Pashtun majority while Hassan is a Hazara, a minority sect ( 10 % of the population ). Hassan is the kite runner who has an uncanny ability to locate the fallen kites and bring them to Amir as a trophy.",1
His Major Surov was riveting. This is his movie. Please put it on DVD.,1
The editing made the story more progressive and captivating.,1
"Provoking an "" ugly cry "" from this watcher.",1
There are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch. You feel for the characters and their plights. I had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint.,1
"But, on its own, the movie is good - - not great but good. I'd rate it C + on the first and B + on the second. I'd wage money on that.",1
This is absolutely one of our favourites of 2007.,1
Can a film be too faithful to the book upon which it is based? Forster makes especially palpable the ethnic tensions between the Hazara and the Pashtun in Afghanistan.,1
"The two may never see each other again. < br / > < br / > But bad times are on the way for the city of Kabul. Here the two set up a gas station and live hand to mouth by selling at niche markets. This was refreshing and lent itself to a sense of realism. Particular note must be made of Homayoun Ershadi who plays Baba, Amir's ailing father and strong patriarch.",1
"along with Forster'direction, moves at a solid pace. The dialogue is not dumbed down, and it. < br / > < br / > Also of note is the screenplay adaptation. < br / > < br / > The dividing line here between this film being great and outstanding lies with the acting. Most of the performances are solid, but there are some that don't quite make the cut, and it hurts the film.",1
"Right, The Kite Runner is about redeeming oneself for the sins of past. No sooner has Amir First, no celebrity stars appear in it. The chief themes here are cowardice and redemption. No, this isn't the kind of movie that I like to slouch on the couch and eyeball at the end of a tough day.",1
"I have read both the book and saw the movie today. At least for this movie, one should try to connect to it rather than judging it objectively. They can put any matured actor to shame. However, this is still a beautiful movie because it makes one think and feel, just like the book. So nothing much there. The storyline is so powerful that almost any script or screenplay would have done justice to it.",1
"< br / > < br / > Anyways, I recommend this movie to everyone. And the story itself was good and pure and uplifting. Showed me a place that was beautiful. It is one of best I have ever seen. I am very glad that I did. Last night I finally picked it up.",1
"But the Hungarian Revolution collapsed due to bad timing. It also showed him to advantage as a "" talk singer "" and a dancer. His comic turn in ONCE MORE WITH FEELING was quite nice.",1
"The actors and actresses have great performances, giving credibility to the realistic story. In return, Amir feels a great respect for his father's best friend Rahim Khan ( Shaun Toub ), who supports his intention to become a writer. Later Amir meets his countrywoman Soraya ( Atossa Leoni ) and they get married. In 1988, they have a simple life in Fremont, California, when Amir graduates in a public college for the pride and joy of Baba. In 1979, the Russians invade Afghanistan and Baba and Amir escape to Pakistan.",1
Greetings again from the darkness.,1
"It was AMAZING. < br / > < br / > Regarding the movie, I feel it was masterfully done. My overall impression was that this film was fantastic ; one of the best - made films I have seen. Also, please note the sound heard every time a kite line is cut. Although the overturned cart of pomegranates was an obvious bit of symbolism ( to me ).",1
"That may give you an idea of just how sensitive and topical some of the material is. """,1
"< br / > < br / > The movie was absolutely fantastic, very moving. Even after seeing the movie several times "" he was sobbing "".",1
It is also a visually stunning film.,1
"This is a moving story about friendship, love, guilt and eventual redemption. "" And the guy who played Amir as an adult was great! The scenes between him and Baba were especially touching. They shot the scene over and over again until they were happy with it. There is a way to be good again.",1
"Amazing, Astounding, Brilliant, Superb. So my judgment and views may be slightly biased. In the book, Khaled Hosseini had dedicated some 10 - 12 pages to describe Amir's state of mind in that position. but I know you won't ask me to. """,1
The Kite Runner should win an Oscar! It doesn't really matter.,1
"< br / > < br / > In short, I thought this was an incredibly moving story. I just watched this film at an advanced screening. So I cannot compare the book with the movie as others have done.",1
"But the way Mr. Forster handled the delicate subject was touching and really, deeply moving.",1
"According to IMDb, Mr. Coughlan is 93 years old and retired from film industry. However, no plane could fly the way this one did - - especially in 1940.",1
"Definite worth a look or six. It is one of the truly rare things, a truly enjoyable one. Chan is in New York and he gets involved with an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft design. < br / > < br / > I really like this film a great deal. Its not one of the nest, and far from the worst.",1
"Nice intrigue especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber plane. This is my fourth review of a Charlie Chan movie in series chronological order on these consecutive days. And "" No.",1
The ending is silly.,1
"Still, it is good see. """,1

Drake believes that by contacting Narvo's elusive wife, he'll be able to pin down the whereabouts of the master criminal. Summoning Kirby to bring all of his dinner party guests together, Chan and Police Inspector Vance ( Donald MacBride ) question those in attendance, as one of them may be the killer.

"Shake up some dry martinis and forget your troubles with this great Falcon movie. Forget those 120 minute melodramas, give me a 1 hour Falcon movie any day. I got a wife and two kids - who's got time for a two - hour movie? How many reviews of this film will I have to write before I get it right?",1
"It all goes along very well, and is thoroughly entertaining. This is the thirteenth Falcon film.",1
"The film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. The Journey "" is a very good film.",1
"There is a murder, and The Falcon gets implicated.",1
Suspect everyone here except the cops here who are after Lawrence and Goldie for the murder. Some nice languid atmospheric nightclub scenes rub shoulders with some especially bad behaviour from the baddies. He also developed serious eye and alcohol problems whilst they prepare to go on vacation. Least favourite bit : the most embarrassing scene in entire series in the alligator wrestling hut definitely thrown in for the kids!,1
he is the best comedian i have seen in my life. this movie was what finally told me that Chris Farley was the real deal. not the same words but the message is all that counts.,1
"It is very funny and entertaining. Tommy Boy "" is one of 1990's best comedies.",1
"I guess I don't have too much to add. I found the comedy to still be funny after more than ten years since it came out. < br / > < br / > The film had a lot of levels working for it on the script, plot and comedy level. It had all the subtlety of a jackhammer.",1
This Movie rocks! Holy Schnikey!,1
This is one of my favourite comedy films.,1
Thank you Chris Farley. I think Chris Farley had a short and successful career.,1
"In all this is a great movie, I recommend it.",1
"But Chris is incredibly, incredibly funny. !",1
! So he was a better Dmitri as Major Surov than he was as Dmitri.,1
No sleepy for Tommy Boy!,1
"Richard, what's HAPPENING to me?!?! "" For fans of Chris Farley, this is probably his best film.",1
"In fact, it is really nothing more than a collection of vignettes tied together by a loose plot.",1
"Well, of course the critics hated it.",1
< br / > < br / > This movie stands apart from other comedy movies. He is as much to credit for the film's hilariousness as Farley and Spade are.,1
The laughs never stop. This movie is hilarious.,1
"a great movie, with a rather unclear political message.",1
"It really showed who he was, and just how much talent he had. Farley and Spade are actually decent dramatic actors as well. So in order to save the company, Tommy has to go on the road to sell the company's new brake pads. It works, and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny. < br / > < br / > Forgive me, but I have to talk about Chris Farley a little more. It's the big, dumb guy versus smart little guy.",1
"What an actor! < br / > < br / > Segal's direction is super. Watch his work in'Tommy Boy ', he's so much at ease.",1
"All the same, he'trying his best to do what he's supposed to. And now there's Deuce Bigalow : Male Gigolo followed by sequel Deuce Bigalow : European Gigolo....... Yes it's not particularly sophisticated.",1
Chris Farley.,1
"< br / > < br / > The main reason "" Tommy Boy "" works are the funny performances from the lead cast. < br / > < br / > Another reason the movie works is the large amount of jokes. I recommend "" Tommy Boy "" for those who are great fans of comedy. Thank you very much, roommate. ( I wonder when their sense of humor died. )",1
This movie has everything!,1
High recommended for a good laugh.,1
"Farley plays Thomas Callahan III, the dimwitted heir to an auto parts company.",1
I really enjoy this movie. ).,1
Her husband arrives at Sharpe's camp to challenge his wife's attacker to a dual.,1
Made me wish her role was closer to that in the books.,1
"Furthermore, Ducos makes Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe film as well, there's a gorgeous woman to be rescued along the way, fancy that. And should anyone be worried that there won't be the standard battle at the climax fret not, because once again the poor old French get a right kicking. Strangely enough though, they actually receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of Harper's baby. < br / > < br / > The story this time is all about the espionage side of things. With the French army retreating in disarray from Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round.",1
"DK3 "" will remain a classic until the end of time. Innovative - - it opened a lot of doors.",1
"/ 20th Century - Fox, 1969 ). Why not, indeed. Along the way, we eventually got to some more family oriented, wider appealing films.",1
Finally this movie made it to DVD and well desving.,1
The struggles of the poor can be seen throughout the world. Claudine is a movie that is representation of the american system at it's worst.,1
I have it! I highly recommend it to every african - american. All the actors worked well together. The soundtrack is awesome too!,1
The Cold War intrigue and the powerful acting carry the story but the romance is never quite convincing.,1
All the 70's styles are out in abundance. Caught this recently after noticing James Earl Jones name on the title. It was better than I expected.,1
Good film.,1
It was about the welfare system putting women in a binding situation.,1
"Almost feels like a documentary at times. < br / > < br / > Mike Judges comeback was a knockout. In fact, the movie is a social commentary. Giving them a purpose in the world.",1
That pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies tend to rule the day. I would have to say this is a great movie.,1
After two DVD viewings I'm glad to say it held up perfectly. I've thought about it frequently ever since.,1
"< br / > < br / > Keep an eye out for a cameo by the guy from the Mac commercials ( Justin Long ) as Dr. Lexus. Until the end, when I took a breath and realized just how close we are to Mr. Judge's vision of tomorrow. Sounds familiar to me, somehow. It'a good laugh and it will make you think. I recommend Idiocracy to everyone.",1
( Beware of landslides ). This movie deserved better.,1
"WRITE more! I'm making all my friends watch this movie, everyone I know. Wasn't sure what to expect. Watch this movie then once you're done, READ more!",1
Luke Wilson is also what makes this movie what it is. I told every one to see this movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > Equally fascinating and sexy, without removing her clothes, is Deborah Kerr. He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot. Yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the Kerr character. < br / > < br / > Why is this an unusual film? All four are great actors and add to the entertainment.",1
"This movie is not only hilarious, but it's balanced as well. Just watch this movie. I stumbled upon this movie by accident. I mean, how else could I find out? Probably the latter.",1
"0 movie experience. Idiocracy "" has exactly the same feel to it.",1
"Yes of course! To each his own fun! Well, we can laugh about it! ( Like history, geography, basic stuff ). And the humor is over the top!",1
First i noticed some people see racism in this movie. I guess you keep hoping that it isn't so. ).,1
"Then, I go back and re - watch Idiocracy, and realize how good is. I strongly recommend this film to all my friends. She knows exactly what I am saying.",1
"There are laughs, there are cringes, but overall this is entertaining. I am rating this an 8 because of the premise of the film. The acting was fine, there wasn't anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling. I have paid my $ 7. The proof is our farce of an election. If you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city, go see it. ).",1
"And I don't say that lightly ; few movies make me actually "" LOL "", but this one did. This movie is BRILLIANT.",1
"< br / > < br / > Besides, I didn't find the futuristic technology to be a problem. The film just happens to take place during the last gasp of humanity, as everything begins to fall apart for good. You can read all kinds of references into the world of Idiocracy. I thought not. "" Is "" Brazil "" realistic? Hell, how about "" Gulliver's Travels ""?",1
"The best show on TV is called "" Ow! My Balls! Also frozen with Joe is a Prostitute named Rita who was pimped to the project by Upgrayedd, her abusive pimp. Obviously, it's not terrible, but it probably could have been funnier. What I mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind from having read the premise of the film are probably about as funny as the film itself. Mike Judge's Idiocracy is an interesting film, and one that his fans will undoubtedly track down and see.",1
"Seriously, is this really that hard to believe. Basically, Judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin.",1
"< br / > < br / > Second. As a result, the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount. ( Actually, the film was shot in Austria ). I thought that I actually walked down the main street in that village. If I didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie, I ate at its double. Don't miss this one. No subtitles are necessary.",1
"It had me laughing out loud many times! I'm going to take my family to see it again this weekend for sure! Welcome to Costco, I love you. It's a classic and no one knows that it's out!",1
It is very funny though. A funny mess of a film. I will not lie.,1
"I'm eating "", and their automated kiosks self - advertising their "" Extra Big - A # # Tacos "". "". This movie is "" the "" stupid comedy of the year, and quite possibly the best thing from Mike Judge since "" Office Space "". This film contained everything I go to the movies for.",1
Recommended! And this world is also incredibly funny.,1
"The film has some truly awesome showcases of realistic retardedness put on a pedestal. It is a story about Joe Bauer ( Luke Wilson ), who is, quite literally, the most average guy in existence. Joe, and a prostitute named Rita ( Maya Rudolph ), become the test subjects for a military project of a hibernation chamber. If it helps, imagine the entire population as just a hybrid of rednecks, jocks, cholos and hoochies.",1
I've never seen a movie get a worse release then this. What is 20th Century Fox thinking?,1
"Many situations aren't allowed to develop, there's obvious overdubbing of expository material, and worst of all a narrator explains EVERYTHING ( most of which needs no explanation ), probably because some preview audience didn't understand what was going on. In other words, a movie about dumbing down has been... you guessed it.",1
"As social satire, Idiocracy is just as good as Office Space, but with a wider scope.",1
"That's really a shame because, in its own way, Idiocracy is one of the best satires to come along in quite a while. Still, I thought it was great.",1
Everyone gets hit in this one esp. Shame on Fox for dumping this movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > This is my favorite Yul Brynner role. She is still The good acting overrides some of the silly dialogue. The Journey "" is a romantic version of the cold war. They make a very attractive couple. Too bad they never worked again. Some of the international cast were recognizable, like for instance, Robert Morley from England.",1
Worth watching.,1
"< br / > < br / > Kudos on Dax Shepard in this one. to the level of his character. As movies go, this is a fairly gentle education. Maybe I'm psychic. Slightly forced at times. F * * * no. But he's not aiming at you. < br / > < br In this movie, he makes a great idiot. After all, she did have to play straight man to an entire planet. But fear not.",1
< br / > < br / > I adored this movie. < br / > < br / > It exceeded them.,1
"It's ballsy at times. What it isn't as far as I can tell, is finished. Though Office Space it ain't, this film definitely has satirical bite and wit. Wrong.",1
Even traitors and stiffs can be identified somewhat easily. The count missing eye points to a terrible past.,1
"It's produced, unsurprisingly, out of Universal International Pictures. The cast are all turning in effective performances, particularly Greene and the wonderfully sneering McNally. A fine atmospheric story with a sense of dread throughout, The Black Castle is a fine viewing experience.",1
"It certainly didn't come across as low - budget, compared to other movies I've seen anyway. She seemed somewhat dry and didn't seem to put much passion into role. Definitely recommended, with a 7 / 10 rating.",1
"The plot is good versus evil. Anyone who helps them is killed. This is little more than a cameo for him. It is best seen in black and white. Still, the tension never stops. The situation is hopeless. They have no escape.",1
"The villain is a mad count played by Stephen McNally, who does a credible job except when he's called on to laugh maniacally. They disappeared in the vicinity of the castle belonging to Count Karl von Bruno ( McNally ), deep in the Black Forest.",1
"One of them is not dead, but he can't move! What is his story? < br / > < br / > So it's strange that perhaps one of Universal's finest Gothics was made in the'50s! That alone makes the film an oddity, since costume dramas were on their way out EVERYWHERE. Universal studios.",1
"and Dr. Meissen ( Boris Karloff ), the castle physician, are virtual prisoners.",1
"The chemistry in the cat and mouse game between Kerr and Brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than the one film together. 8 / 10 < br / > < br / > All in all, a thoroughly engrossing movie which I would definitely watch again. He was saddened by the fact that his job had alienated him from his friends and enemies alike and he yearned for social contact.",1
"When he arrives in the castle, he is invited to hunt in the Black Forest around the castle with the count,. My vote is nine. The story is gripping, and is a great entertainment for any audience.",1
This is a prime example of uninhibited filmmaking at its best.,1
The cast of unknowns provide performances full of power and emotion.,1
? The whole point of killing Kelly was that she was unnoticed by all of us.,1
Gets of with a powerful opening and develops like a hymning requiem. One of the most important films of today.,1
"This is a remarkable film by first - time director Murali K. Thalluri. A scene of panic opens this film, at 2 : 37 pm set in an Adelaide high school. This coming - of - age film is both intimate and thought - provoking with surprising and disturbing ending.",1
"The factor on Thalluri's talent is his subtlety. If you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who has, 2 : 37 becomes all the harder to view. At 2 : 37, a high school student commits suicide. As time goes by, each characters fragility creeps out, dragging you along their emotional roller - coaster. He respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered through at sometime. Not shown who has taken their lives or reasons known, time skips back to the start of the day. While the core of each film is different, both tackle teen life. A defining point to Elephant was its ethereal ambiance.",1
"That scene made me cry. He knows how to make a movie. I missed by a mile. Sad, isn't it? I hope he has more coming.",1
"It does not compromise nor does it serve laughter. And finally, there are decent placements of music. < br / > < br / > Let's stick to the movies'technique. This movie substantially focuses on emotional precipices. And that is what keeps this movie from being really good. That's what really impressed me. There is no : friendship, love, smiling, truth, passion.",1
< br / > < br / > Go see it.,1
This is one of the great transition films of the latter part of the Golden Era of American film. Do not miss it.,1
All those that identify this as a simple rip - off of'Elephant'- are there no other comments that you can make towards the movie on its own merits as an individual film ( regardless of its apparent similarities to other movies ).,1
"Or were you caught by surprise, like in real life? And why is it always someone, you would never have expected it to be? < br / > < br / > This movie delivers well. It's not about life in Highschool. And it does so in a very intense way. Do we really understand their motives?",1
"I find that the movie may have seemed pointless to others, but i would like to think of it as important. so there are a lot of things to relate to. Who can't relate to being an outcast or being bullied? They feel that say the incest part isn't easy to relate to, that it isn't common. that happens all the time. How can it not be considered realistic. and many viewers are probably concerned with there education such as Marcus. Many of them aren't going to come out and say it, and mostly these are victims.",1
"< br / > < br / > Regards Jan First of all, i must say i really enjoy watching this movie.",1
"It will be very interesting to see Thalluri's next projects, since he has had a great debut with this movie. < br / > < br / > 2 : 37 is an excellent movie, whose only fail is that the ending feels a bit affected, but which compensates that with a lot of positive elements.",1
Chief of which is isolation. Although it was a pleasure to see it. < br / > < br / > Not to missed. Rather it should be recommended to those looking for purpose in their viewing.,1
I applau the fabulous casting of this film.,1
"< br / > < br / > The film is very well shot, with terrific direction. Ultimately, it's a beautiful made, but slightly disturbing look at teenage life.",1
"I just could not look away. It was riveting. Often parent dismiss their kids problems as trivial, but unfortunately to a high schooler they are massive. And unfortunately the problems can escalate into a tragedy. < br / > < br / > Definitive a must see for all.",1
at 2 : 37pm. don't feel cheated by the ending. it contains a very important lesson. Well... What to say.,1
"< br / > < br / > The film basically starts off with a suicide in a school toilet. < br / > < br / > The film is shot beautifully, and sounds incredible. < br / > < br / > The film is shot in two separate'modes'if you will. < br / > < br / > This is Definitely one to watch.",1
Not to be missed. A hilarious plot and a wonderful film. There is not a dull moment in the film and Debbie looks beautiful as always.,1
"This is a charming little film, which like many of it's kind, derives it's charm from the circumstances involved rather than the actual dialogue. < br / > < br / > Ford is also falling foul to his new $ 40, 000 Lincoln Futura Concept Car ( the future Batmobile ) which he wins in a raffle the same night he meets his new wife. It is also putting him in the 80 - 90 % tax bracket and as penniless as he is he now faces a tax bill of over $ 17, 000.",1
"This is my all - time, number one favorite movie. What else can you ask for in a film?",1
"Fox's screen debut. Watch for the cameo from Paul Reubens. Needless to say, this is a real fun movie to watch.",1
This one tops my list.,1
Well worth it though.,1

"GOOD NEWS! I bought a brand new, newly released, VHS copy of Midnight Madness for $ 9. 99 on Amazon. If you love the movie, grab it.",1

!,1
"For a movie that was PG, this is one fun film. I love nostalgia.",1
sometimes it seems that people have far too great expectations for movies. this was such a fun film and i remember watching it repeatedly. it was so nice to read the comments from the actors who played the twins. what a pleasant surprise when i viewed it!,1
"Elsewhere "", and later was on "" Babylon 5 "". The Blue Team is about an overweight rich kid whose dad just wants him and his misfit friends out of the house. For Michael J.",1
"This movie typifies the early eighties as well as FUN!! ! Luckily, I have a copy now!",1
"< br / > < br / > Look for appearances by Michael J. I would hope so and how can I get involved? < br / > < br / > This movie is a classic and ripe with laughs, adventure and an all star, 80's cast! < br / > < br / > I own this movie and can never watch it enough! < br / > < br / > The only down side to this movie was Debra Clinger'performance as Laura.",1

"Those are signs of a good movie to me. Also, it's sometimes sarcastic, and funny. I could say this movie stands the test of time, which I can't really say for a lot of 80's movies. Oh, You'll see.",1
"Spin City and Alex Keaton himself, Michael J. If you do, is worth your watch. A rather silly little film you just may love.",1
Or none. My personal favorite is Armpit. The cast is top notch. It's an American Classic. Or Blade? Midnight Madness is one of kind.,1
"< br / > < br / > And Deezen... well, he's a show in himself. < br / > < br / > Who wins? His dad looks over his obese, slovenly frame and gives a simple, one - word response - "" Yuck! "" My hero.

"I can't forget it no matter how hard I try. The giggling twins are a scream, too. Wish i could find a copy of this on a 45rpm record.",1
This movie has everything. and sucked 200x worse. He treats Alex P. like crap. This movie rocks! SEE THIS MOVIE! This guy rocks! GOLD!,1
"Thank you Gorman Bechard for proving that false. < br / > < br / > Run, don't walk, to see this movie.",1
WEEE this is still jolly good fun!,1
"Because of Disney's backing, "" Midnight Madness "" obviously had a large budget. A huge cast and a ton of diverse locations go to show that. Fox. ).",1
"Carol found it at Kmart for $ 6. 99! Well I just discovered IMDb from my twin sister, Carol.",1
* * Warning! That she does. < br / > < br / > What carries the movie is the work of the cast.,1
This one is 7 / 10.,1
Seth < br / > < br / > The film starts out promising.,1
"! Fast foward to a year later, where where Stella Bridger ( Charlize Theron ), John's daughter, is one of the top safe - crackers that anyone can ask for. So me & my friend made plans to see it after school today.",1
"Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts. This is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies. Warning : If you've seen the trailer, then you have seen the movie.",1
"That guy IS FUNNY! It'fun, fast and entertaining. < br / > < br / > Pretty obvious, but SO WHAT? This group of protaganists are already on the wrong side of the law. The first 15 minutes sets up our reason, our motive, our main objective.",1
"Here's another pleasant surprise. < br / > < br / > Overall, 8 out of 10.",1
"This really is a movie that you need to see twice. Great movie, you won't disappointed.",1
And Donald Sutherland!,1
The sound score is outstanding.,1
Go watch it!,1
"< br / > < br / > The only problem is that it is very predictable. But she enjoyed it. He is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch. One of my top movies of the Summer so far. I went to see this movie with a lady freind of mine, who doesn't like heist movies.",1
I enjoyed this movie.,1
"I have seen Italian Job probably 20 times, and I'm still not tired of it. I also enjoyed Mo Def as the explosives expert that's afraid of dogs.",1
"Everyone I've talked to who has seen this film, enjoyed it. features interesting characters and is nicely firmed. It's twisted Hollywood, for you.",1
The latter action scene is a very long 20 min. < br / > < br / > - The actors do a decent job too with Seth Green being my favorite of the group. Can't wait to see what he does with the sequel. He and his accomplices leave thinking that the group is dead but luckily the group is not dead. I haven't seen the original that this is based on so I can't really say how well it stacks up to that one.,1
"As it is, we have this guy who has been agonizing over a woman who left him'years ago. But he doesn't come across that way in the script. I loved most of the script but did not like the ending. If she were dead the ending would be much more believable. Gorman insisted the ending was as it had to be. The character is simply not cold enough. The two leads did an amazing job.",1
That image is burned in my mind forever. As an actor though he is pretty good.,1
The Italian Job is a real blast to watch. Not awe - inspiring but a great film to watch at the end of a lousy day at the office. < br / > < br / > Barky It's just a fun movie.,1
"Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron all turn in solid, fat - free performances. For people to whom the soundtrack is important, this movie is a delight.",1
They chased underground. I like the actors in this film. I like the mini coopers. I enjoyed the movie very much.,1
"Look, people, it's just a fun movie. ! Granted, "" Ocean "" is a better movie, but who cares?",1
I must admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved 7. The plan is flawless and the execution perfect. 5 / 10.,1
"< br / > < br / > First of All, Robert Addie ( Gisburne ), you are among us all, you live forever. < br / > < br / > It is not true the series would have gotten worse if further continued. You will at first loathe the third season.",1
"It is now on DVD, so go out and buy it. Very atmospheric and creepy sometimes. If I had kids, I would not let them watch this.",1
For me still one of best TV - series ever!,1
"I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving by creating another Robin, this time the Earl of Huntingdon. It was the highlight of the week. Other Robins always look too old ( Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent looked like Robin's granddad ). I believe there were legends of several Robins in medieval times.",1
"I personally think that Praed is the best of the two Robins, but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series with. In any case, we can now watch our favorite series over and over again! It was great to see it again, and it is the best of all the Robin Hood movies and TV - series.",1
There are 15 years between these two series.,1
RoS is a timeless classic.,1
"And, it manages to do it without showing too much blood. Marian also develops her relationship with both of Herne's sons very well. This is no children's television programme, it deals with witchcraft, treason, rebellion and injustice. Nothing's forgotten. The picture quality is very good and remixed and remastered surround sound is amazing.",1
"And there are a lot of them. First of all, Michael Praed IS Robin Hood. Fortunately, it gets better. This is one of my favorite series, all categories, all time. There are a lot of other great actors here, too.",1
"After that, they get into it and the acting is great!",1
"This very much makes Robin of Sherwood into a story about multifaceted, REAL people rather than of good and bad people something which very much adds to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal. The characters are wonderful in particular because of their complexity. It's a wedding, not a celebration! "" is just one of their many timeless "" pearls of wisdom "" which seems to follow one through life : - ). Filmed in beautiful locations, with clever, amazing scripts and As listed and stated in many previous comments, this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients to its credit.",1
"I personally think that Praed is the best of the two Robins, but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series with. In any case, we can now watch our favorite series over and over again! It was great to see it again, and it is the best of all the Robin Hood movies and TV - series.",1
"Request granted. ) < br / > < br / > Then again, I need to see it again knowing ending. < br / > < br / > I like this movie.",1
"He has found his calling. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. She is an outstanding actress.",1
"One boy died of a heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at 15. Why? Even Robert says he stayed clean in spite of Helen. All but one of the 21 residents are gutter drunks / addicts. < br / > < br / > Helen admits she ignored her kids and spent every day in bars. Outwardly it seems she made a huge sea change. Her signature song is "" My Way. "" The daughter was not pleased.",1
"Oh so beautiful, oh so tearful and so gut - wrenching. < br / > < br / > Sister Helen is not a real saint.",1
Sister Helen is an incredible character!!! < br / > < br / > I was riveted by the people in this documentary.,1
"The ending scenes are particularly involving and emotional. ). < br / > < br / > You will never forget Sister Helen, Robert, Moe or poor Ashish ( spelling? The house holds 21 recovering addicts each with a story almost as involving as Sister Helen's.",1
"I got a chance to talk with the co - creator, Rebecca Cammisa at the 2002 High Falls Film Festival in Rochester, NY. The way the film introduces us to her past is excellent, spending only a few carefully selected minutesprinkled throughout. It really is a treasure of cinema and the subject a treasure of humanity.",1
It doesn't work that way. In real life she won the Nobel Peace Prize. The acting is all decent. There are lessons to be learned here. < br / > < br / > It is not an easy movie to watch multiple times. < br / > < br / > The scenery is beautiful. Patricia has guts.,1
"It would have been difficult for Laura, and is difficult for the viewer as well. Another plus is the strong SE Asian scenery in film, which was enjoyable to see. Secondly, if you did make it Burma, your passport would not get lost. I would give this movie a good strong 7. U Aung Ko was good, but also understated.",1
Her sister ( McDormand ) talks her into going on a vacation to Burma. A bad trait for a doctor. Patricia Arquette is in this movie. < br / > < br / > I found it to be very moving. It is about real events in a real country.,1
I rank it 58 in the top 100 films of all time. < br / > < br / > Thanks Bob She witnesses mass murder and totalitarianism and escapes.,1
intense. I find this project to be nothing short of a masterpiece.,1
"Check it out, you won't regret it! It is particularly relevant today, given world events.",1
Has the situation changed since 1995? One soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and I admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final crossing - the - river scene. It's a shame we hear so little about countries such as Burma and this film at least gives some insight into the country.,1
"But, how can you feel angry about these poor people?",1
I came across this movie on TV.,1
"This is an unforgettable story. I was stone myself. "" Continually her life was in danger.",1
"I saw Beyond Rangoon about 20 times, it was THAT GOOD. It's a movie that could easily been seen by the whole family, although not for children under thirteen. However, the educational benefits of this movie can not, and should not be understate.",1
"It is after all, real events of a civil war. < br / > < br / > I was only a year old in Rangoon ( now Yangon ) during this tumultuous time. < br / > < br / > Anyway, the film was honest - to - God and I was glad at the accuracy of events portrayed.",1
"Beyond Rangoon "" is simply marvelous. Hopefully there will be extras, with the alternate ending. "" Every time she is given a close up in the film, the audience is given insight into her character. She does not need to speak to convey emotions, or be over top. Do not by pass by this film.",1
It is clear this film that you are not alone.,1
"It is a very important and moving film, and should be seen by everyone.",1
< br / > < br / > It is about time this film was released on DVD. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or her democracy movement. Can anything be done? It effected me so I wanted to understand more about the situation.,1
"She is convincingly detached and depressed. < br / > < br / > Of course, the real measure of the movie was its entertainment value. Beyond Rangoon finds a good balance between politics and storytelling.",1
"< br / > < br / > Secondly, it's about a woman's struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss. It's an earnest and moving film. < br / > < br / > This movie is one of my favorites because of its themes.",1
She moves through life like a zombie because her family has been murdered and she can't see the point of living. This is one of the most underrated movies of the 1990s.,1
Watch to find out!,1
Can you still trust government ethics? < br / > < br > Homicide or suicide?,1
Very convincing documentary. A little bias but it hit hard on the government.,1
"I've watched this film several times now and truly appreciate the eye and ear the director has demonstrated. By the end I was fascinated and repelled and utterly unable to tear my eyes away from that film too. The intimacy and pacing drew me in and never let me go. I am a film directors nightmare... especially of the mega buck, multiplex variety.",1
This was a potent lesson in seeing for yourself. This is as it should be.,1
It will make your blood boil. A lot of people have the belief that Koresh was some kind of madman who thought he was God. What is even more shocking is the actions of the FBI when they entered the Mount Carmel. Most people feel the cult was at fault for not agreeing with the FBI on reasonable terms. Many people remember the Waco standoff that occurred a long time ago. It will make you wonder as to what kind of people run this country. < br / > < br / > This documentary is one of the most balanced examinations at the situation that occurred. This video is frightening and I highly recommend it if one can find it.,1
If you value your freedom! I won't mention its name since I'm a coward. They even hinted the Davidians had it coming. This film peaked my interest in the subject and I have read several books on the subject since then.,1
"Additionally, a list would take away from the film opening up as it goes along. < br / > < br / > The picture puts on many masks to tell its story. Communications between two were spirited but eventually broke down. I am more and more sure of that since I watched the great documentary Waco : The Rules of Engagment. I watched a made for television film about the destruction at Waco, Texas. It was the Republicans that seemed open to the other side. < br / > < br / > It was then that the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) got involved.",1
"I was amazed. However, I had never seen 3 / 4 of the footage they used.",1
"And it's at times superfluous for those who watched the CSPAN hearings and the 60 Minutes reports. The film someone had to make. < br / > < br / > The first thing you need to know about this film : you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies. If, on the other hand you want a more concise ( albeit unapologetically one sided ) version of events, you should see "" Waco : The Big Lie "".",1
Told with unflinching eye and with gripping style.,1
"Regardless of what you saw on TV, you are not fully informed until you watch this movie. Do we really want to give away our freedoms to these people? Is it worth it?",1
"Shaky, annoying... like the characters. < br / > < br / > Brundage as Buddy is depressed, angry, heartbroken, a shell of a man. Until you realize their back story, told in short flashbacks.",1
"For anyone remotely interested in the government, this is a very crucial film, a must see. But none of it was illegal. I even think this should be shown in classes - it's that important. Sure, there were lots of weapons at the Branch Davidian compound. But this is the first film that had me seething with anger after I saw it. I voted for the man when I lived in NY state - I'm a Democrat, pretty left - leaning too.",1
"Both are equally frightening. Most importantly, what about the children? These are questions that I haven't been given answers to by the government. A big cover up by the FBI, a massacre by gung - ho / trigger happy government agents? I clearly remember the Waco standoff, I was 17 years old at the time and watched it all on CNN. I remembered reflecting about all the children as I watched the Mount Camel compound burn in April 1993.",1
Rules of Engagement is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. They were simply standing up for there rights to bear arms and practice their religion as American Citizens. If you are the FBI why engage in psychological warfare and offer little in actual negotiation to help solve situation? Why open large holes within the compound structure when you know the possibility of starting a fire? Why lie about not firing weapons when it can None of this was truly factual but rather story spun from bits and pieces of facts. The cover up is what left me really fuming. Why pour gallons of harmful gas if you want to save children?,1
< br / > < br / > Do not wait. See this film and tell your friends.,1
"They gave it a good try in Seven Ups though with the chase scene. Strictly Hollywood, I would say, except that it was filmed in New York. This goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing. Bill Hickman was driver of the bad guy car in both movies. Bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds.",1
All around a fine flick that for me gets better with time.,1
9 / 10. Roy Scheider is not Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood but then who is?,1
I think it should be film that should be released on DVD and not just forgotten. THE SEVEN - UPS does not disappoint. I certainly enjoyed every minute of it.,1
! And then Roy sits up - - great!,1
"This film explores the aching pain in us all, the frown beneath the cheery facade, the ache below. < br / > < br / > The soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if able and strong enough. It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer - by's. The perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues - those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide it. Death is explored figuratively and literally.",1
! They become involved in a battle with the mob.,1
Character development does not evolve at all on the screen. The Seven - Ups is a good and engrossing film.,1
"Scheider heads the group with his posse or regular looking joes. This movie is not about the soda nor is it quite the French Connection. Quick moving and intense, fresh for thirty years.",1
"< br / > < br / > Everyone has an opinion about car chases. This is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings. The story is spare, tight, and subtle ; it gets the job done without extraneous elements.",1
The film isn't overly complex after the plot is set - up and we realize who is the ring - leader in the scheming of mobsters. Buddy has a pal from childhood named Vito ( Tony Lo Bianco ) who swaps information with him regarding mob types and shysters working the streets in NYC. Scheider has never been given the credit he deserves as a fine lead actor. He has emotional range and we see how losing his cop and friend takes it's toll on him.,1
"A real bang - up little winner. The climactic shootout likewise delivers the stirring goods. Don Ellis'rousing string score further pumps up the raw'n'rattling intensity while the scrappy Big Apple locations and Urs Furrer's rough, grainy cinematography both greatly enhance the overall grungy realism.",1
"Each chase scene has its own qualities, and this one is simply superb. We get to see unpleasantness and a pre - 1990s New York City.",1
""". A great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture. I truly miss those times. A spot - on characterization of both the film and the city.",1
"And yes, the car chase is one of the all - time best. I was born in'68 with not much parental guidance as far as what I watched on TV ( as a kid in the 70's ).",1
"We never know what we are capable of doing. Very emotionally stirring!!! You Are Alone "" is that movie ( for me ). ! The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. Amazing soundtrack!!! The ending was perfect.",1
Please enjoy.,1
"Scheider reminds me < br / > < br / > Vito getting close with his boyhood friend Buddy Manucci, Roy Scheider, as a mob informer to win over Buddy's trust and have him tell Vito what's coming down on the streets of New York in regard to mob activities. Buddy is a cop who works in a sub rosa unite of the NYPD, the Seven Ups, that does things "" their way "" to clean up the streets of New York of criminals. Later Ansel was accidentally killed by Moon when he blasted out the trunk of the car that Ansel was locked in thinking that there was a suitcase full or cash, ransom, in it. < br / > < br / > Roy Scheider who is not a big man is as tough and effective as any big action actor I can think off like Clint Eastwood would have been in the same movie.",1
"What it did have was a great NYC backdrop to a simple crime story. It had no subplots or amusing character developments. Locations that were bleak and dehuman They mirror my attitude. It could be a G movie today! The undertakers. As a matter of fact, there was a body count of just three. There was no tough guy philosophizing, ala Tarantino. That is why it was good, because it was tough, basic and economical.",1
Academy Awards follow. Lots of shots of Hackman's cursing face as he wrestles the battered car through the streets. The chase is staged by Philip D'Antoni. It's a success. Bill Hopkins drives the criminal vehicle.,1
"Overall a decent cop action / drama, not really my thing but I liked this one. Richard Lynch happens to be one of these sleaze - bags, and he's as creepy as ever. Look for Joe Spinell ( Maniac ) in a small role. Seems that there are two guys, posing as cops, that are kidnapping mob types and holding them for ransom. 7 out of 10. But that's only the beginning.",1
The chase goes on for nearly 15 minutes and is the best you'll ever see. You can tell that Lo Bianco's enjoying the game throughout the movie. This movie has become a classic crime drama from the heyday of 70's film - making.,1
"Not out on DVD yet, though. One of my favorites. A keeper. great, if underrated 1970s cop drama.",1
"A stringy, screechy score by Don Ellis sets the perfect mood. Before then, there was too much Hays Code - constricted pap. ( In fact, that line may not even have been stale when this film was made. ) ( That VW bug going about 2 mph always bothers me in the Bullitt chase. ) THE SEVEN UPS : bleak, grim, action - oriented, grown - up.",1
A short classic.,1
Nowadays'Mickey is an smart ass little whiner when compared this.,1
"Her definitions may be Clintonesque but that doesn't lesson her enthusiasm. The film's imagery just keeps coming. There's Daphne, a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life. < br / > < Britney loves sex.",1
This short was wildly fun and positively entertaining.,1
Mickey Mouse!!!!! ! < br / > < br / > 10 stars indeed!!! It's the 1920s.,1
"Also, this is not first cartoon with sound. I mean, this is the third Mickey Mouse cartoon. < br / > < br / > Here is the plot. Mickey gets her up by a crane. Either way, this film is really, really groundbreaking. Yes, the third. They use the goat to make the song.",1
These are the things I don't like about it. But it is also Minnie's and Pete's too!,1
"Not to sound like a wet blanket, but the short is far from perfect. The result : Steamboat Willie was a runaway hit for 1928. The plot ( there's an actual plot line here? ) Powers was experimenting with at the time ). No doubt about it.",1
"A cat is swung around by its tail, a goose throttled about the throat, and a piglet viciously booted. If you're a fan of Mickey Mouse, or Disney in general, this is one steamboat you can't afford to miss. ' Steamboat Willie ( 1928 )'is often erroneously touted as the first Mickey Mouse film, though that title actually goes to'Plane Crazy ( 1928 ). But Mickey is not to be outdone in nastiness.",1
"Very good! Mickey Mouse was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Cartoon.",1
"And the cartoon is funny! It is Mickey's third cartoon, and one of his best ones too.",1
"Clever and a real crowd - pleaser - - this film still ranks among Mickey'best films even after 80 wonderful years. This is because it was the first sound cartoon. However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is. STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.",1
Mickey Mouse is now 75 years old.,1
"He does not yet speak either. In the cartoon, Mickey does not yet wear gloves.",1
It also goes by fairly quickly for its less - than - ten minute run.,1
I think the Disney shorts are much better than feature length movies. I was able to get this cartoon on tape and I really like it. He could just whistle and play music.,1
"These dates can be checkout on IMDb under "" release dates. The true answer is "" Plane Crazy "" not "" Steamboat Willy "". Steamboat Willy was not the first cartoon to feature Mickey Mouse.",1
< br / > < br / > thanks - Cofffeut,1
"< br / > < br / > Strongly recommended. They all do a good job, with the exception of Cesare Danova who sleepwalk through his role.",1
"I saw this when I was twelve. OF COURSE!!!!!!! """,1
I can't say that about half the movies I've seen this month.,1
She's too damn real for words.,1
"It is not a visual film and I think it would have played better on the stage. Truth, be told the Nazarene is also selfish because he gives without wanting in return or asking for it. But in essence Bunuel also inquires into the ogle of man's selfishness and need to sin and how goodness may save us all. Nazarin by the acclaimed surrealist Bunuel is ovbviously an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values.",1
"Nazarin appears credible as it has been made in a light, comical vein. It is amazing how Bunuel approaches quest for true love issue in his film. The toughest question asked by "" Nazarin "" is about the strengths and weaknesses of organized religion. This is a film which should be with any discerning DVD collector.",1
"It concerns the individual's struggle for humanity and altruism amongst a society that rejects any notion of virtue. < br / > < br / > This is a remarkable film and I would urge anyone interested in classic cinema to seek it out. Father Nazarin, however, is portrayed more sympathetically than Sister Viridiana. It is one of Bunuel's most moving films, and encapsulates many of his obsessions : frustrated desire, mad love, religious hypocrisy etc.",1
"In other side is Andara, one of the towns prostitutes. Andara fights with her cousin with terrible consequences. She have a kind of repulse to him. < br / > < br / > If is the sweetest Buñuel film that i have seen so far, is too the most spiritual. With this, Andara search mercy from the priest. He lived in a simple and poor region.",1
"He wants to be more like Jesus, leading the meekest life possible. Great films, but not masterpieces. Luis Bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was obscure to me. Later on, he suffers even worse punishments from clerics. His superiors assume the same and punish him for it. Third, I saw L'Age d'Or.",1
"Spanish director Luis Buñuel career spanned almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. In any case, great film.",1
"< br / > < br / > "" What?? Without a doubt, by the end of the film I was looking up to him and not down on him! And who says the priest couldn't eventually emerge from that "" dark night "" and regain his confidence? Perhaps we've only been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey. ( Alas, if he can't do good in this world, who can? ) Luis Buñuel unabashedly praising a Jesus - like figure?? "" < br / > < br / > Some would argue that Father Nazario's doubts regarding his faith point to the loss of his saintly values.",1
He is recognized in the world as one of the best that have ever existed.,1
"Not because faith in itself is bad, but because people always mange to bastardize the concept. Definitely, one of the filmmaker'best movies. Message aside, I think this is one of Bunuel's most clever works. Francisco Rabal is superb as the priest.",1
"This was one of his best roles. < br / > < br / > Nazarin, by all reckoning, is a saint. In fact, this saintly figure makes a case for humility. Rita Macedo, as Andara, is also excellent. Andara and Beatriz, two prostitutes from his old town follow him. < br / > < br / > Francisco Rabal, the Spanish actor, makes a wonderful Nazarin. Nazarin's life parallels that of Jesus.",1
"Their appointment climaxes with the story's concluding twist. < br / > < br / > The film's dialogue is natural, real to life. Daphne is intelligent, yet clearly still an eighteen year old.",1
"I could almost'feel'them. Gotta go now. The acting was superb. Oh, the memories!!",1
"Comparing Nazarin and his "" holy women "" to Jesus is a nonsense. On Nazarin's way, only brambles and couch grass grow. All his words amount to nothing.",1
"The film is simple and profound as well as beautiful, ironic, and heartbreaking. His madness consists in taking seriously great ideas and trying to live accordingly "". < br / > < br / > I consider Bunuel one of best filmmakers ever.",1
"Also the movie has best oriental supporting cast since "" house of Flying Daggers "". In terms of plot their is enough of other things going on to keep you interested.",1
There's also fine score by Raymond Wong as well. The most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years.,1
< br / > < br / > Quite a clever movie.,1
You are in the hands of a master cinematician.,1
"Do yourself a favour and see this film! Thank God, Hollywood hasn't ( yet ) - made and ruined a classic.",1
"Top notch casting! Having seen'only'about 200 Hong Kong films in my time, I have to say this film is among my very top favorites. A truly fascinating and entertaining watch!",1
"It's a Johnny To film after all, it has to. That's the plot in a nutshell. < br / > < br / > Andy Lau has 72 hours to live. So simple yet so powerful. As it is, this is another one of his films that is flawed but enjoyable. When he'good, he's REAL good.",1
I don't think I have seen Andy Lau in better form.,1
I like that in a movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > The subtle relationship between the two lead characters is a rereshing change. No car chases. To an extent, it is.",1
"Overall, a really solid film. The story is fast paced and really sucks you in to it. I've recently seen An zhan.",1
This film is one go out of your way to see.,1
* * * of 4 stars. This is an impressive feature film debut both for MacArthur and Frankenheimer. This film came on the heels of the success of Rebel Without A Cause in 1955. The dialog is realistic and most of the scenes hold up surprisingly well.,1
"< br / > < br / > The rest of the film has Hal try to straighten himself out but is unable to do that because the low esteem that It's when Sgt. * * * SPOILERS * * * Well made and interesting film about the alienated youth of America back in the 1950's. Shipley, James Gergory, tells Hal that his dad is coming to pick him up when he finally sobers up to the fact of what he's done.",1
"Look for James Gregory and Whit Bissell in supporting roles. "" Young Stranger "" represents his Hollywood debut.",1
"Arguably this is one of the best. The supporting cast is memorable, Frankheimer directs like an old pro.",1
"< br / > < br / > But MacArthur keeps carrying a chip on his shoulder, which even his sympathetic mom ( Kim Hunter ) can't knock off. < br / > < br / > We are still in those semi - mythic 50s when teenagers drove jalopies and jeans were still dungarees.",1
You'll see the difference between good and great.,1
Hot sex.,1
"! If you like seeing naked chicks, this one delivers. < br / > < br / > Shame on you Hollywood!! Such a film is VIrtual Encounters 2.",1
"< br / > < br / > If you have VC 1 and you liked it, you'll like VC 2.",1
I honestly found Wicked Little Things to be a very cool and fun horror film. And while it is a little cliché'e and over the top its good. 8.,1
"It would seem that Cardone finally found the right script and cast. The film is deliberately paced, which I liked. Still, I found the tool - using child zombies in this movie interesting. < br / > < br / > Taylor - Compton also appears in the Halloween remake. She ignores him, but since he has a cute friend, she joins his group.",1
"Medium - well on gore but what there is nicely nasty. The actors believe, so we believe. Cardone brings it to life... er.. uh death.",1
I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.,1
"Excellent acting. A bunch of kids are killed in a mining accident back in the early 1900's. It was so spooky! Not by a long shot. But I'm a horror fan through and through. < br / > < br / > Worht a look. The eldest daughter is rebellious, obnoxious... a typical teen.",1
"The characters of the children and the principals are GREAT! Typical horror movie fare. This work is pretty atmospheric, with a couple of surprises a few really creepy elements.",1
"She really needs to start starring in more horror movies. How did they die exactly to become zombies? Wicked Little Things'really separates itself from other zombie movies. They kill you with either a pickax or shovel and eat you after wards. Yep, only at night. Second, they can't die.",1
"The tendency to superimpose images is, alas, annoying. ( Yes, I put the composer first. Bah! "" < br / > < br / > Anyway, The Mikado is a compleat S & G operetta. It's got a wonderful degree of craziness. It has an interesting book and sprightly dialogue. You don't even hear the names of librettists for Offenbach, Suppe, or Balfe.",1
and I left pleasantly surprised. The film works on many levels. However theatre in which i saw it in was horrible.,1
"Wicked Little things was a really good movie. These are B - Movies people, and nothing more.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film is also well produced. Having finally been able to get the DVD of this 1997 HBO film, is at down to watch it. The film's fascinating cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style at times. By the time I finished it the old saying "" those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it "" was echoing in the mind. The events of the film are true ( minus some dramatic license which is always necessary ) and in hindsight are made even more shocking then they must have been when the film was first shown twelve years ago.",1
"Likewise, it is not illegal to either own guns or to pray toward Mecca. Living in a free society has its drawbacks. This film is bone chilling in a way that is hard to describe. I certainly hope they are not supporting our government officials being able to break into any person's home or office to search without cause or without a warrant.",1
I lived in NYC ( Brooklyn ) a few years and kept in mind. 9.,1
"It could have been easily prevented. This was actually said by Ramzi Yousef after his arrest. Next time we'll bring them * BOTH * down. "" It shows how the 1st and 4th Amendments are partially to blame for attacks. This movie was just unbelievable.",1
I found this movie harder to watch after the events of 9 / 11 then the video of attacks of 9 / 11 themselves. < br / > < br / > All I can say about this film is don't watch it alone.,1
I was very impressed.,1
Look...,1
I might buy another.............,1
< br / > < br / > Let's focus. Newman rails against the false accusations when they cause him direct harm but he minds his own business. And our sadness is that most of us need to be beaten up to realize the dangers surrounding us.,1
This movie absolutely horrified me.,1
An excellent cast.,1
"< br / > < br / > Lawrence Newman ( William H. Macy ) served his country in the Great War, and has since lived a quiet, conventional life in New York.",1
"The scene is set after World War II, at the height of McCarthyism. The chilling thought is that in some places, probably still is. Newman is the head of Human Resources for a company which is basically, anti - Semite. Focus is another great movie starring William H. Macy. < br / > < br / > The movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal.",1
Arthur Miller certainly knows.,1
"Maybe a bit high, but it's so worth seeing. So I told her to see the movie.",1
A MUST TO SEE. MPAA Rating PG - 13 < br / > < br / > My Rating : 10 and up < br / > < br / > My * Rating 9.,1
"If you're a Gilbert & Sullivan purist these changes may bother you, but I think they're fine - - and I love the costumes! All of other main characters do a fine job as well. Foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner, lipstick, and blush everywhere. Liberties were also taken with the setting. I really enjoy this particular production of "" The Mikado. "" and Lesley Garrett as Yum - Yum. ).",1
I'm a huge fan of legendary director Elia Kazan. It deals with anti - Semitism in a very realistic way. < br / > < br / > The movie is very well written and well acted. Both Macy and Dern's performances are outstanding!,1
"The actors do good job. And that only, because he looks like one. That makes their lives unbearable. And he lives in a very antisemitic neighborhood. The Christian and the Jew.",1
The glasses he chose makes him look Jewish.,1
"At times that seemed a little heavy - handed to me. Why not call the police on seeing the rape, even if the attacker was a neighbour? Larry's unassumingness seemed exaggerated, almost to the point of the grotesque. Larry seemed to think so because her name was "" Hart. """,1
Go see it to find out. It touched me. The sound was well done. Chilling. The writing incredible. Emotionally intense.,1
"Those statements all sound equally ( im ) plausible to me. If he has long hair, he smokes dope. The glasses are just the little bit of change needed to CONVINCE others he's a Jew.",1
"His presence brings unexpected results. Macy is continually pestered to come to the "" meeting "". Funny how neither is Jewish in this film but the accusation is made. < br / > < br / > A tough, emotionally charged film.",1
Animal aggression and anger have blinded Fred's Union thugs to reality. The message lurks there too.,1
"It is for the individual to decide where he or she stands. Post war anti - semitism is setting here, but there is injustice at all times and in all places. Soon after he gets glasses because of poor vision. As he is now better able to see, he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life. This movie packs a punch. It starts as he witness from his bedroom window the rape of a Puerto Rican girl by the son of his neighbor.",1
!,1
"< br / > < br / > At the beginning, Lawrence Newman is an ordinary man. Is he Jewish, is he not?",1
Lawrence's view of the world and its view of him is forever altered. < br / > < br / > Attributed to Rev. Inaction makes one no less culpable.,1
"So if you liked Xena and Hercules, you'll love Cleopatra 2525. They all are different, but as a team, they work really well. Cleopatra 2525 is a very funny, entertaining show.",1
"And that's why I like it. I will never forget Hel, Sarge and Cleo. It is superficial. But hey, they only had 20 minutes in every episode. It isn't like any other series.",1
"Instead, the characters ( both m and f ) became more interesting. < br / > < br / > Well, what can I say. I can imagine feminists have their fun with this, too.",1
< br / > < br / > and oh what a living!,1
"As I have said before in previous comments, some programmes are there to be'Light entertainment '.",1
I LOVE this stuff.,1
"While it features several predictable quickfire gags,'Beep Beep'also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious, longer sequences. There's also a very funny longer gag involving some rocket - powered roller - skates. 'Beep Beep'also sees a great improvement in the representation of Wile E. Coyote.",1
"< br / > < br / > The old rocket gag is present, too. Here, the comedy reaches a peak. after the blast. Then he has an idea, and another laughable expression is worn.",1
And Eric is hotter than ever. Hey we are just like everyone else.,1
Predictable? Another great one.,1
I think I am some kind of Road Runner fan. The plans the Coyote comes up with are very funny.,1
The colors are magnificent. It gave us an aerial view of the chase in a maze - like structure.,1
"On another whole level, it's a stoner's paradise. But that's just scratching the surface. This is the movie he would have made if he'd had the chance. Unexpected stuff happens so often that it stops being unexpected. < br / > < br / > On some level, this is a movie about sex. People are constantly being whipped and stabbed.",1
"It's not a movie for everyone. There was a lot of love lavished on the look. Most important, it had a weird edge to it. The story was funny and profane and unusual.",1
Then he meets up with a strangely possessed but alluring country girl. A terrified girl'head explodes. Throats get slit. Some brutal stabbings. Excellent. She offs one of the leads by plunging a cross in his skull. It even has an original classical style musical score.,1
A back in time tale of strange goings on. Who fills Stefan in on the Evils a foot. Very Entertaining and Original.,1
"It's like somebody wound her up and turned her loose. < br / > < br / > But don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining. It's in the ideas. This film is very dark, very confusing, and ( at times ) very funny.",1
"It all seemed pretty predicable. < br / > < br / > SEA OF DUST starts out like a typical costume drama. Great visuals, cool soundtrack, lots of interesting ideas. Yawn, I thought.",1
"It was number 15 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. Frost is the nanny who does not let the kids win. Very good! It is just the best behaviour documentary programme, not just for tips but for the transformations.",1
That goes for all races today. How do I know this? He even taught grade 3 the year before he came to Winnipeg.,1
"Supernanny Jo Frost, in each episode, gives a family the benefit of her hard - earned experience. But when she's gone will they succeed in sticking to her tough disciplinary rules or do they face a life dominated by unruly children.",1
"I prefer the British version, with the sterner nanny approach. !",1
Finally!!!,1
Sad but true. It's fiction.,1
Now I myself had previously seen a few episodes of the Leauge Of Gentleman which I found hilarious. It truly deserves it review a definite 10 out 10.,1
"< br As Tubbs or Edward might put it, it's a local film, for local people, and a precious thing at that. I'm not really bothered if it's not as good as the TV series, because I loved it.",1
( Peter Kay? ),1
< br / > < br / > Watch! It is a nice ending to their TV series.,1
What makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the family's reactions.,1
"I laughed out loud numerous times and applauded the brazen style of humour. This makes Mr Bean look like the watered down wimp he is. It leans more towards young ones and Guest House Paradiso in its'comedic style. However, I loved it anyways!",1
"Bernice's confessional in the beginning was hilarious, hearkening back to the quicker, more sketch - oriented feel of the first series. The Gentlemen have fun breaking the fourth wall, though, and even add a new element : a second fictional world ( "" them days "" ). Pauline and Mickey have cameos ( no Ross though - strange ), although I would've loved to've seen more of Ms. Campbell - Jones. Papa Lazarou is accounted for, as are Tubbs and Edward.",1
"I was so excited to see what the Gents had done and how they'd done it. And you know you've enjoyed a very clever and funny film. David Warner's turn as Doctor Pea is fantastic, slightly camp and very funny. < br / > < br / > And it was excellent!",1
"Dads Army ', the list goes on. The best British Comedy Film ever! This I hope is not end of Royston Vasey, not after this great success anyway!",1
"Mayhem ensues, as reality and Vasey converge with the vast array of characters entering our world to save theirs. You're not real! """,1
"< br / > < br / > When the first series aired in January 1999 it was mind - blowing! < br / > < br / > As I say, a lot to live up to. I have to admit that when I first heard about the Apocalypse film it was a worry.",1
"For many this will be a really enjoyable 90 minutes. Few shows have survived transition from radio to TV to stage show to film but The League of Gentlemen have achieved it with suitable aplomb. It's also hard to believe the creators ever wanted their offspring killed off, which is perhaps why some of the role reversal doesn't always quite hit the mark. Would Hilary Briss have wanted to try save Royston Vasey in the series?",1
"< br / > < br / > The film was complicated ( in a good way ) and very very funny. It follows Geoff Tipps, Hilary Briss and Herr Lipp as they try and save fictional Rosyton Vasey from the disinterest of their creators.",1
"Yes, but somehow they managed to pull it off.",1
"( But you knew that anyway. ) < br / > < br / > If that sounds a bit too serious, don't be put off. they can write other stuff - and it can be very funny. The film was apparently spawned from an idea one of the writers had when he'saw'one of his creations in a supermarket. If you're new to The League of Gentlemen, this is an easy introduction and a lot of fun. If you're a long - standing fan, this has everything you've come to expect - including the joys of Jeremy Dyson spotting.",1
Thanks for such a great movie. Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other. He did an superb job in writing and producing this film. I grow up in a big city in the mid - west.,1
"< br / > < br / > Watch it for Garfield though, he is the only really lasting thing about it.",1
This movie was made 20 years before my time.,1
"Other than a tiny bit part in Footlight Parade years earlier, Garfield had no other film roles. All the same man and all so incredibly different. But not four every day type daughters. < br / > < br / > Four Daughters is also known as the debut film of John Garfield.",1
"Despite that, this movie still has an overall feeling of goodness, which is why I liked it. Curtiz made sure no scene, soapy or otherwise, went on too long. I am referring to Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane. Some of the characters may have done stupid things, but they good hearts.",1
"The two gate swinging scenes are pure movie magic. ( Imagine a Jimmy Stewart or someone in the part. ) Also, I was not convinced that Garfield would make the pivotal ( to say the least ) final decision that he made.",1
"A raft of supporting actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, May Robson, and Eddie Acuff, makes it all believable. Ann is the eternal optimist, even when she and Mickey are down and out. The three Lane Sisters, already famous for their musical abilities, turn into accomplished actresses, playing their parts well.",1
"However, true stardom was not to be. Claude Rains is warm and wonderful as the patriarch. Then she meets ne'er - do - well Mickey Borden, who falls for her as well. < br / > < br / > This is a fairly formulaic story given life ( and sequels ) by the acting.",1
"Ann urges him to create a beginning and an end. Its definitive scene takes place in the Lemps'living room. The fates are against me. But he says, "" It stinks. """,1
"A soap opera by Fanny Hurst has been turned into a cinema masterpiece. Throughout, the craftsmanship is enough to inspire awe.",1
"Some of those ideas are included here. Okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side. Because it tries. < br / > < br / > Many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus. For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them. < br / > < br / > The acting isn't the best here.",1
Also this was John Garfield's first film and made him a star. Ann ( Priscilla Lane ) is a romantic.,1
"Warning, contains spoilers! Specially Anne Heywood looks and acts good. My rating is 10.",1
To talk of pornography or gay self - effacement misses the point and intelligence of this work. Outstanding in ambition and it's unceasing plummet into depths of human emotion. A tour - De - force of cinema.,1
Don't miss this if you can find.,1
"Because it does not rely on gratuitous nudity, or superficial pop - cult. There are no explosions nor is the drama straightforward. That film, like L'Homme, is more than what the box might lead you to believe. L'Homme Blesse is not for an impatient, adventure - seeking audience.",1
It transported me into an awfully familiar realm of longing and desire. So French and what I consider daring!,1

After the final bell, the movie splits off into five different plots. And this movie perfectly captures everything I love about the show and puts it in full - length form.

In this film I prefer Deacon Frost. He's so sexy!,1

"That whole sequence was so STUPID! The hairstyles, the dancing, the music, dialogue, its all funny as hell. Now I just find it amusing as a guilty pleasure, kinda like Road House.

"One can only hope that she can be persuaded to return to opera one day. Min Tanaka is the dancing Oedipus to Langridge's singing Oedipus. I would love to see a Ring cycle directed by her. The current Butterfly at ENO uses Japanese puppetry. Red ribbons are a recurring theme. Coincidence maybe, or evidence that Taymor's influence is pervasive. The singers are fairly immobile, in accordance with Stravinsky's wishes.",1
The staging is simply extraordinary. cf.,1
If you don't see this you have missed out.,1
"I wish I could have met Ida Lupino. Ugh. Her life story would make a great tele movie ( Hey, Mr Bogdanovich........ ).",1
"But it's well done, and, again, it sticks with you.",1
"The cast and script is excellent. Film noir in color is not as good. I never forgot the movie, or her. This is a mostly unknown movie that all film noir fans should see. I have this movie on VHS tape.",1
"It's amazing what impact a good story and great actors can make. It has been almost 50 years since I saw "" Jennifer "" for the first and only time. Each time Miss Lupino discovers a new "" fact "" she draws the viewer into her confusion and fear.",1
"It is a cheap as film making can get and on the other side it is creative as well. < br / > < br / > Joe D'Amato Directed and Produced this film under his company Filmirage. Well, Deep Blood is far from that.",1
"Lee Wilkison, offers John Parrish Fifteen Thousand Dollars for his ranch and John turns down the offer.",1
< br / > < br / > The cast is a highlight. The Violent Men is a good western. < br / > < br / > The inevitable final showdown between Ford and Keith is one of the best in western movies.,1
This Is one of my favourite westerns. What a cast!,1
"For that, Parrish also had something to say - "" Never meet the enemy on his terms "". It's always interesting to catch a line in a film that winds up being somewhat prophetic for the future of an actor. Ten years later, Stanwyck would star as the matriarch of the Barkley Family on "" The Big Valley "".",1
"The gleam in her eye as she sees people face death for her is unnerving. It is worth waiting for. Then, there's Barbara Stanwyck, the real ruler of the roost. This is the classic western.",1
"I really enjoyed this movie. But, that's just what he is about to do. Glenn Ford was someone who showed time and again what can happen when you misjudge someone, and I really enjoyed watching him get justice the old fashioned way. Talk about getting even big - time. Kind of a neat added bit of justice, he kills this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cowhand.",1
"< br / > < br / > Originally after watching this one i had a sense of frustration, chiefly because of the cast that was involved. But for what it is, Robinson's crutch toting "" bad "" guy is at the least memorable for all the right reasons. But The Violent Men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the missed opportunities evident with the production. While Eddie G, when one gets used to him being in a Western, is fine in what is an under written part. Well i slept on it and decided to ponder further about the picture.",1
I loved it. I can't wait for Blade 2.,1
< br / > < br / > See it for camp value.,1
Lee was crippled in a land war he fought 12 years earlier ; his brother Cole ( Keith ) has come up from Texas to help him run the huge spread. Glenn Ford was the only box office draw at the time. He has a very original confrontation with the main gunfighter about midway into the film.,1
Dianne Foster plays their daughter who comes to admire Ford. Then you know what happens next.,1
"A western through and through. With courage, never stop striving for what you feel is right. Great action and mostly quick paced.",1
"It also featured realistic people in a realistic setting. The men way out - shined women in this film, acting and character - wise. Highly recommended. It turns out that Ford was the star of this film while the other two stars were in supporting roles. It's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars. Ford had the bulk of the dialog.",1
"But The Violent Men is something special. No matter to Barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother - in - law Brian Keith. He's every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often. I almost expect those famous words from Wild Bill Elliott to come out of Ford's mouth, "" I'm a peaceable man. """,1
The women have a crucial part. She wants him to sell the ranch no matter what price.,1
"< br / > < br / > Parrish is not even much of a cattleman but he do understand that there is something big building up in the valley In the Army, they used to call it'enemy pressure. He dreams to have position and respect in running one day Anchor < br / > < br / > Lee's ambitious wife Martha ( Barbara Stanwyck ) secretly hates herself and her husband Stanwyck Can he easily argues with a man who started with a few acres of land and now owns practically the whole valley?

I loved the whole Lonesome Dove saga. She just liked playing with him. I cried. Comanche Moon is the best of bunch.,1
"For starters, Simon Wincer's back, a man who's name is synonymous with high - quality TV westerns. what? ) Comanche Moon "" had everything going for it. So many wonderful, rich moments in the miniseries and, to an even greater degree, the book, are completely missing in "" Moon. """,1
Amazing! It blew my mind how well they played each role! It was very entertaining! His mannerisms were perfect. Its hard to compare any film to Lonesome Dove. My favorite was Steve Zahn.,1
Things I like.,1
"That's the whole point : They have a lot to learn. Viewers are saying things like, Zahn and Urban aren't as deep... Puhlease! Val Kilmer was absolutely great. Everyone wants Duvall and Jones back, come on!",1
"No, I don't think so. I can't think of another actor who would have been better. I was happy to see that they finished up with Comanche moon.",1
"They helped make this long movie palatable. Scull "" is really an original, if I ever saw one : a strange dude, indeed. They were a joy for these male eyes to ogle. Just don't expect it to be as intense as "" Lonesome Dove. "" ).. It gets compared to the latter simply because this a prequel to that famous story. I wish he had had a bigger role in this miniseries.",1
The actors did a very good job.,1
"But hey, nothing is. Second, it's not as good as the original Lonesome Dove. Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli ( sp? ) It's the best TV I've seen in years. That's just they way its going to be with a film adaptation of anything. It's a fun set up for Lonesome Dove.",1
"It'got something for everyone. There's a lot of action, humor, tragedy.",1
Please check this video out if you can find it.,1
"It's as close to a textbook audience grabber as I've ever seen. < br / > < br / > Everyone, who watched opening, stayed to the end.",1
I was pleasantly surprised and amazed! S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Nanny.,1
< br / > < br / > This films is Truly Exceptional!,1
And what is its genre? How amazing to see the fresh and talented Tom Hulce so pre - Amadeus! Who was this David Shaber? And such a script! So what makes this movie so special?,1
"Hoot Gibson... Howdy Doody? "" I'm talking about the * theater *! "" Who do you dream of?",1
"I hope that this show will last long! This is a great show with total freshness and innovation. Either way, it was funny as hell.",1
This is a brave attempt by Fox. I can't wait to see Bobby Lee on his show. Full points to the writers and Spike for that.,1
We like this show and want more. moments. It's just plain funny!,1
"< br / > < br / > Talk Show with Spike Feresten has a genuine sense of humor and has never deliberately or vindictively insulted any guest or performer. ! It would really be very foolish and sad shame to cancel Talk Show with Spike Feresten. Spike's well rounded personality always gleefully, poked fun of life and himself. < br / > < br / > Apparently The Fox Television Network has rewarded Wanda Sikes because she has garnered a self important appearance front of President Barak Obama.",1
"Spike Feresten is a comic genius. I particularly enjoyed sketches... "" Unfair Target "" will be a cult classic in no time. His likability is palpable. Set your Tivo's people... this is a show not to be missed.",1
! Great New Show!,1
I liked this one even more than X - men. He is just not an emotionless super hero.,1
His great writing skills helped this show overcome a series lack of money and helping hands.,1
It was amazing!,1
"'You tell'em to go to hell and they look forward to the trip '. Frank Sinatra, the most generous tipper? This is the least likely movie a Vegas Casino executive would recommend.

Imagine if Stu were alive today! < br / > < br / > This movie is worth rent.,1
"that's how incredible this man was. can't wait for the DVD. But, I swear to you, I don't see how anyone could ever play gin better than me. "" as dark as this movie was, stuey's real life was darker. stuey unger was a card playing legend. I doubt it, but it could happen.",1
"Some have called it "" extraordinary "" ( as would I, actually ). They NEED a hero. < br / > < br / > Why?",1
It's a movie with a theatrical message blended with some clever moments.,1
Bye! John Travolta knows what he's doing. It then turns into a road trip that's both horrible AND great.,1
"This film is superb! It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing, but he does. Also aswell as Wesley being quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy. The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too.",1
This movie is an all - time favorite of mine. < br / > < br / > Thanks andNJOY!,1
"It's fun, romantic, and recommended by me. His interest in women and the Beatles takes a new spin on the angel thing. The film is not that bad. 4?? In fact, I found it quite funny and memorable.",1
Boy!,1
Maureen Stapleton is neat in a cameo.,1
"honestly, i loved Michael. it'not very often i see one in a movie. angels and all.",1
Good fun.,1
< br / > < br / > Why?,1
"Just watch it for Travolta, sit back and enjoy. Recognize the character? Character development just wasn't a big thing in this film.",1
So an interesting journey began. She also showed her singing ability. He was not alone. Michael was asked to save it. That was just what Michael wanted to see.,1
The music contributes a lot to the mood of the movie.,1
"Anyway, it's pretty interesting movie. < br / > < br / > What John and Paul said...",1
"You will not, therefore, be insulted by this film. < br / > < br / > It rates 7. If you are, this is one innovative RomCom. ( Although, as movies go, I loved Dogma! )",1
And once again this movie thrilled me. On his way Michael helps all people he meets.,1
"This is one of my favorite "" Capra - esque "" comedies. It's not religious commentary. ). It's fun.",1
"The movie was funny, yet touching. I don't think a better portrayal could have been done.",1
It just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful road trip. And who doesn't love Sparky? High recommended. Michael isn't about a complex plot anyway.,1
"Angels are a bit of an American obsession, but are often rather boring. Watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",1
Where'Blade II? Great flick 9 / 10.,1
"I wish there were more movies like this. Plot summaries are available everywhere, but the plot isn't the point.",1
"And you have to love the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance to "" Chain of Fools "".",1
"The frailties of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions to him. Her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie auto - pilot mode. Fanda, to the contrary, is perhaps too blithe and absent - minded for his own good.",1
"Chaste kisses, that is : there's no lechery here. He lives in a very nice apartment with his wife of forty - four years, Emilie. < br / > < br / > Frantisek Hana is retired and on a pension, his previous occupation unknown.",1
"Vlastimil Brodsky as Fanda, is fantastic.",1
The acting is superb. The resolution of the story is beautiful.,1
Those who plan for death will live in the grave.,1
"This is a FANTASTIC film. If Hána can, so can I. But I think I will skip the smoking part. Tomorrow I am gonna go and buy myself a mansion and have some fun. He is joyful, witty, mischievous, and never boring.",1
"In fact, though we're not yet 30, I could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife. - - nor have I ever been elderly. To qualify my use of "" realistic "" in the summary, not many old folks I know go around pretending to be famous maestros, blind people, etc.",1
Nope.,1
The movie has quite a range of mood. < br / > < br / > 8.,1
"He wants to help and love and give... but at what cost? He wants to enjoy life and make people around him laugh. It makes you think of how we live our lives and why we live our lives. Their son is about to take their apartment over and put them into a retirement home, but Frantisek doesn't want to hear any of that. Funny, moving and well - developed. < br / > < br / > Jirí Hubac's screenplay is exquisite.",1
Enjoy. I am absolutely sure that this film is great.,1
"Up front, if you're tired, the first hour could be slow. The film is gently shouting to us to live life to the fullest while we can. His playfulness can be infectious.",1
"I would give it a 10 out of 10 rating but I am giving it a 8 for two reasons. The film has aged well : the 1980s costumes and hairdos add to the wackiness. We both loved the movie. Still, I would recommend the film to anyone who wants a sophisticated, spicy, and fun time. I love Almodovar's films.",1
"Labyrinth of Passion "" - - with the possible exception of "" Matador "" - - is Almodovar's best film.",1
"I. There is nothing to be provoked or shocked about, and I guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional. Very typical Almodóvar of the time and, in its own way, no less funny than many of his later works. He's building up for masterpieces to come, but is not yet there.",1
"Otherwise it was actually quite entertaining, and most of all it kept my attention and interest for the two hours it played. The movie's way of telling the story and the backstory was a great mystery.",1
"When going to see Rendition, I was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with big - name actors. It's a shame that Gyllenhaal with probably get nominated before him. Take it for what it is. Metwally, again, was terrific, and I hope to see him in more mainstream films.",1
We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. Well enough about that. < br / > < br / > Very frightening. He is of course just like you or I.,1
"NSA? Witherspoon is wasted in this role. Like "" The Kingdom "" it scratches the surface of a very complicated subject. The Director uses a neat time line switcheroo to hook the audience. Torture, ( CIA? She gets an old lover to help.",1
Meryl Streep plays the head of the rendition program ; Jake Gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to the interrogation and whose conscience gets in the way. It's definitely a film whose sum is better than its parts.,1
"for the illegal interrogation even torture of terrorist suspects by - passing due legal process. Taut, topical political thriller, taking square aim at the controversial US policy of rendition, another appalling Orwell - ian phrase ( collateral damage, anyone? )",1
Is torture ever right? We are defined by our attitudes and our responses.,1
"It's always disappointing when a film with such provocative material is sloppy with some of the details that make good films great. The five or so stories RENDITION follows are woven together If so, at what cost? The reviews for RENDITION generally haven't been favorable, so I waited until it moved to the local discount theatre to see it. Good luck to them. I laughed out loud, when the moment should have been filled with dread.",1
"This is more believable than if he were to come across as being an "" old hat "" at it. I found movie to be powerful and thought provoking.",1
This movie is important.,1
Mr. Arkin seems to get better with age. < br / > < br / > Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero. A CIA agent who really can't take what's going on. She is out of the George Bush - Dick Cheney school of handling the war on terrorism.,1
"I'm Egyptian. I was not told the reason for my detainment. He was waiting for me. I have a green card. I have children who are born in the US. It toilet I was not allowed to use my phone or ANY other phone. When I asked to use the bathroom, an officer accompanied me there.",1
Wesley snipes played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires.,1
The cause given is that he made phone calls to a known terrorist.,1
< br / > < br / > Don't you just hate it when the title of a movie sends you to a dictionary? It's inevitable. No kidding.,1
"This film did not make me hate America, although I can see how it could do, but it made me hate the way that America has reacted in its post 9 / 11 world. Of course now that makes me a "" bleeding liberal "" labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not. You get an ever increasing cycle of violence. I wish this film would be shown to all school students, at minimum. Some films are designed to just entertain you, others to make you laugh, or cry, or uplift, others, like this, aim to provoke, to make you think, and to make you angry. This is the American way apparently. People who don't realise that as the movie said, for every person tortured, you get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance.",1
"The powerhouse cast pulls the crowd in the theatre, despite the ominous title. ), and a pivotal scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public plaza, so that must have sent chills up every moviegoer's spine.

"The film tackles the here and now horror of "" rendition "" with a multi - cast trans - global account of all involved. There's a wonderful line in the script that says that torture is a sure way to swell the numbers of our enemies. The awful truth is that we in the UK and USA have lost the moral plot and this film shows how low we are prepared to go.",1
"Metwally's performance as the tortured prisoner is Oscar - worthy. The film will keep your interest, and have you engaged in each of the character's plights. I fear you speak upon the rack, where men enforced do speak anything. "" < br / > < br / > The film may be described by some as a political piece, but is ultimately an emotional one.",1
"Thus, without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together, the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams, with story elements flying off in all directions. He has an American wife, a young son and a new baby on the way.",1
I liked this movie. Ah - - relief! '2 birthings in 24 hours'was how he joked about it.,1
"Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blade's Alfred so to speak. Luckily all these problems are fixed and improved on in the stunning sequel, "" Blade 2 "". The acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure. To start I'll say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts I've got to say. 6.",1
It's one of several story lines. It's almost as if he was being tortured for real! You are a high - paid professional.,1
The cast was seasoned ( fantastic performances all round ). Omar Metwally was outstanding.,1
Not to be missed.,1
"When does it become "" right "" to torture? Right on. Are we saying it is right to torture someone who is not an American Citizen?",1
"Sure the effects were not great, but they were also not horrible either. Still, this show was fun without being as corny as the Batman show. Just reading why this show got canceled makes me rather steamed. It is nice that this show actually has the web shooters and not organic shooters of the movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > And no one wanted to pick this series up. the network did. either way, it's entertaining, even for today. so if you think about it, it's a rather good TV series. < br / > < br / > I always figured bad ratings killed the show, but no.",1
< br / > < br / > This show is mostly well written. I believe Stan Lee wasn't a fan.,1
"Spider - Man "" had its own very talented stuntman to perform the death defying daredevil acrobatics. on DVD shortly. "" < br / > < br / > It's unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes. His name was Fred Waugh, who donned the spidy suit for the action sequences.",1

"Jannings'performance is brilliant, all will, want and need. A Henry VIII as he must have been. < br / > < br / > Sparkuhl's cinematography is gorgeous in the restoration, the tints sensuous. Even the hooded torturers have body language.",1
"Really? fist / punch was literally a letdown. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. ' What about the scalp? You will want to see Blade succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. Uh, okay, I am going too deep. So maybe'The Matrix'copied'Blade. Once again, sit back and enjoy the techno - charged fun ride. # 2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI even for 1998 standards. Blade'would be an extremely above - average comic - book, vampire - hunter action / horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout.",1
! Quite a good film.,1
This is a truly wonderful love story. But what wrong with that. I first saw this when I was about 13 and loved it then.,1
"30 years after the original film, "" Goodbye, Mr. Chips "" was made over as a musical. He has lost the coveted award 8 times now. < br / > < br / > Surprised to see Petula Clarke cast as Mrs. Chippington. < br / > < br / > O'Toole was excellent here and received another Oscar nomination. You have to wonder what Peter O'Toole has to do to win an Oscar.",1
"Will anyone speak up? Ah! Or, can you? This is your Great Story.",1

""", "" Walk Through the World With Me "", and "" You and I "" are especially effective. Where Did My Childhood Go? An absorbing, brilliantly acted, directed and written film.",1
"I will quickly praise a few of them. The director was able to bring the story to the screen in a fresh new way. Leslie Bricusse is one of my favorite composers. The music is great, and the songs move the story along just as they should. I love this movie because every single element of it is nothing less than excellent. Listen to these songs, how could anyone not like them?",1
"< br / > < br / > Thanks to the wonderful people at Film Score Monthly. You also get 1 unused song which is a real lost gem, "" Tomorrow with Me "" by Petula Clark which would have been chosen in place of "" You and I "" before hand. He is seen as being cold and unfair and not in touch with the times. During this time musicals were out and the Hollywood studio system was in total shambles.",1
< br / > < br / > Let's start with the good things! This is not a movie for kids! The overall story is too thin. The action scenes are great here too.,1
"Fantastically written, acted, and produced! Great storytelling!",1
There really is nothing not to like about this film. It's a good cheer - me - up selection. Terence Rattigan deserves an A + for his update of the James Hilton story.,1
The acting is top notch.,1
"I saw this film when it first came out, and didn't know what to expect exactly. But if you like a truly great film musical, then this film is for you. There's not a bad song in the entire film.",1
I enjoyed.,1
Most critics in NY hated this version. Some good songs esp.,1
"Simply ecstatic to learn that finally, this delightful Irish - flavored pot of gold musical is released on DVD! Yes, "" Talk to the Animals, "" too. 'Clark and O'Toole somehow gave us just the right mix of spunk and circumstance. 0 - Kilometer Zero "" Chipey. The songs and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse are catchy as usual. Ah, "" it's that old devil moon ( in your eyes ). "" Caught this 1969 film on cable TCM one night.",1
Very enjoyable movie and story! I think O'Toole played character perfectly!,1
"What a mistake!!! First of all, as "" Chipping "", Peter O'Toole gives one of his greatest performances. I am anxiously awaiting CHIPS'debut on DVD. )",1
"Introverted and socially inept, he is dedicated to his students but unable to inspire them. Andre Previn's score was rejected, and the one eventually used was composed by - unfortunately - Leslie Bricusse. In the time they spend together, she discovers a kind and gentle man beneath the befuddled exterior, and upon returning to London pursues him in earnest. When the fall term begins, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young bride, and the two settle into a life of quiet domesticity.",1
"If you only see one Ernest movie in your life, make it this one! ). If you haven't already seen it, watch it! < br / > < br / > A great flick!",1
"You will find him quite satisfactory "" no what I mean? This movie is very funny! ernestfunclub. com Which is the best Ernest movie?",1
"This is a really good flick with awesome humor. Good directing, good script, worth rent. I bought this movie right after i saw it.",1

"Disagree with me if you must, but deep down you know I am right.",1
You've surely seen him somewhere. I really liked the whole vacuum cleaner sequence early on. Knowwhaddamean?,1
At least until he was reinvented. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe. Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character. Far from it.,1
She was really cute in this movie. I'm glad I ended up going to this movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who asks!,1
"Jimmy Buffet's music was a plus, and the scenery was wonderful... It did follow Carl Hiassen's book well, and it was fun to see him in cameo performance.",1
What a hoot too this movie is. Ste.,1
! Hoot is the best movie. a perfect family film.,1
i know you will like it.,1
"A good, solid film, all in all. In "" Hoot "", a new kid arrives to Florida from Montana.",1
and Enjoy!,1
"Well worth your time to see this! This is a good family movie with a few laughs. I mean, the it just flowed too easily.",1
The ending was good.,1
He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood.,1
The storyline is pretty simple. I rate this film a 9 / 10. The music is not too shabby.,1
And those baby owls were adorable. I wonder how they managed to film them. Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher. It is probably a bit too slow paced for kids under 6 yrs of age. A bit predictable.,1
"Florida is full of so many fun characters and the film does a great job of bringing that to the screen. It's really a simple story, but also one that they need to hear at this age. Hoot was terrific. My kids particularly loved all the different animals, from snakes, to owls to alligators.",1
"Then, today, I rented it and watched it and really enjoyed it.",1
Unlike when he evaded the police. You can see this with Enron and WorldCom.,1
I hope you come away from this movie feeling as good as I did. Just plain fun! !,1
I highly recommend this movie to everyone.,1
thats what is great about this movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > I was pleasantly surprised. I read the book in a summer book club, and all of us there loved it. The characters were interesting, and the plot was cute and not too overstated. It was a kids movie that works just fine for adults or teenagers, too.",1
The acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see.,1
9 / 10 Its a pure rush of dark comic book action.,1
He kept us adults awake. The setting and music were beautiful.,1
I know a movie is good when I get goose - bumps in the end. I'd recommend it to any everyone. I have to get to get a Jimmy Buffet CD now!,1
"In my opinion this is a great family movie. Also, the photography of Florida wildlife spoke volumes without dialog.",1
But Florida is a lot different from Montana. < br / > < br / > This movie was pretty good. Plus the owl were really cute.,1
"So was FREE WILLY and look how well that did. Who cares if its predictable, and a little corny.",1
"Hoot is a film aimed squarely at families looking for a fun day at the cinema. It is great to see a film starring kids whose idea of "" acting adult "" is not engaging in sensuality. The young actors are spirited and refreshing. A positive message from positive film. The soundtrack by Jimmy Buffet is a perfect fit.",1
Plain and simple.,1
"This background shows : the film seems like a collection of fifty 2 minute arty commercials. Other skits are better, though. ).",1
I saw this at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival. 0 out of 10. Gustav Danielsson is the cinematographer. Roy Andersson directs. It's a nice movie but hardly worthy of an official submission for best foreign film.,1
"But whilst some may hail it upon an artistic throne, others will simply look on in confusion. The end result is a moving, if somewhat fractured tale about humanity in its simplest and most honest forms.",1
Not as easy as you may think! I enjoy the National Anthem. Someone asked me what it was about. Larson! Go see yourself.,1
But hey - - this is Sweden. Isn't everybody depressed? Running through them are various themes. Wives slam doors when their husbands start to practice their instruments.,1
This movie is positive. Great movie. Still the movie has aura of total originality.,1
"So corrosively funny. You, the Living ( 2007 ) < br / > < br / > Mordant. A startling, beautiful, odd experience. Let me look it up. Ordinary life is shown to be frumpy, ironic, delightful, coy, and depressing. Exactly.",1
At once alien and familiar. Shows us something I had not seen since his last film. This film is brilliant and life affirming. Andersson gives us something else here. It has taken him seven years to make this. It is powerful stuff.,1
Or is the irony of the opening scene's wailing Cassandra a more resonant reflection of our perceptions on individual existence?,1
"You can't really call Roy Andersson prolific, ( 6 films in 37 years ). That, and some rollicking music, ensure the time we spend with them is time well - spent.",1
"The majestic scenes from "" songs "" pale in comparison here. Minor Spoilers will follow. A work of visual splendor. In other words Roy Andersson is back with a vengeance. A very warm and humanistic film. There is no crowdpleasing.",1
"After this hilarious introduction, however, the mood of the film darkens considerably. < br / > < br / > The world of'You, The Living'is also blighted by selfishness.",1
"It simply is, and you react. < br / > < br / > Tomorrow is another day. This film isn't supposed to be funny, but it made me laugh. < br / > < br / > It isn't written as action adventure, but my pulse raced more than once.",1
"He makes Blade as deep a character as Michael Keaton made Batman. Hey! where the heck did Kris Kristofferson get acting talent? It had a script, too! Who would ever think that a comic book movie would be a launching pad for an actor?",1
< br / > < br / > Only one woman in the film appears to have any sort of understanding of what is going on. I really didn't see this one coming. And the web of egotism in this movie is truly hilarious. The very depths of egotism are plumbed.,1
It is a touching look at the human psyche. There is no plot.,1
"With all the misery in the world, how can we not get drunk? "" While there is no continuous narrative thread, theme of greed and desperation appears in several sketches. < br / > < br / > There is also a hefty admixture of irony.",1
"Look out for the Flying House in the beginning folks! < br / > < br / > So what's the score with "" You, The Living "". A short review without any spoilers follows. I'm so happy films like this are being made in our age of blockbusters. My initial reaction is one of wonder and happiness. < br / > < br / > Well, sorry for this ranting praising review.",1
"What most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by other people. But then again, what is perceived as reality here is not very much different from the dreams. The Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson's latest film You, the Living is not easy to review.",1
Viewers of original show may like this.,1
John Denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot line is great. It is difficult to try to catch it on TV all the time.,1
Angles! !,1
"That is why some people call it "" the children's holiday. "" This is a regular Christmas fare for my family ; I rate it 4 / 5. George soon meets a love interest in Susan ( Jane Kazmarek. ) George is trying his best to make this a special Christmas for his daughter. Were it not for grinch ( Renfield ) it would be an ideal time.",1
Thanks. I truly don't feel the true spirit of Christmas anymore but watching this movie helps to find that feeling again.,1
"And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first.",1
I was surprised to John Denver! Very cool as this is my home region. Just watched it on the Hallmark Channel. I'm sure it will be on again in 2007.,1
Enoy and tell others about it. Merry Christmas!,1
So this movie is very special to me.,1
All 100 plus. The choices were hard to make. I was there this year and it was wonderful. My Santa Lucia Choir was chosen to be in this movie.,1
Great gentle film for everything Christmas is really about. com for all those who wish to own it as well as on video. This is good news as it is one of my favourite films!,1
It was returned and put back where it belonged!,1
"Great values without sex, violence, drugs, nudity, or profanity. We love his movies.",1
He seemed so real. Disney needs to see this film and put him to work. The only thing I remember Christopher Atkins doing was Blue Lagoon. They liked the music and all the extras on the DVD. My kids love her! There wasn't much we didn't like about this one.,1
But ultimately it's the tremendously dynamic A bickering family also shows up on the premises to check out the hotel.,1
This is a quiet movie.,1
This is a movie for the classic movie goer.,1
"The film's scoring is aesthetically spot on with a good deal of it contributed by Tito Larriva, who also plays as band boss for the taxi dancers.",1
"< br / > < br / > This movie is strange, but then so am I ; no wonder I liked it.",1
A good choice of music rounds off the film nicely. The sets are also very authentic looking.,1
They have a little time to save London from total catastrophe. They are trapped into the barrier and dropped to sea. This is a catastrophe movie set in London. 000.,1
"< br / > < br / > Additional Info. < br / > < br / > Bad language : Some, strong. < br / > < br / > Sex / or nudity : Some strong, as well as innuendo.",1
"Gee, I guess that blue wall of silence is still rather think!",1
He was freed after the war and died in the East Germany.,1
I recommend this for anyone who is interested in military history. This was my second viewing of this movie in a few years and was captivated by it's realism again.,1
"World War II was the most graphic and bloody affairs to ever occur in world history. Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. < br / > < br / > The film follows the course of the battle. Much of the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan's battle sequences seem to have come from this film. Von Witzland acts as sort of the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi.",1
"They fight only because if they don't the enemy will kill them, and if the enemy does not then their own officers certainly will for refusing to fight. The visceral storytelling and harsh images though make it something more than a war film, even more than an anti - war film. Describing Stalingrad as a war film may be a bit inaccurate. This portrayal adds another layer to the suffocating envelope of trapped hopelessness that pervades the film. Yes it contains action scenes depicting bitter battles and terrible destruction.",1
"One of the best war films I have ever seen, if not the best. It is very hard to talk about such films as it is very difficult to point at any film mistake made.",1
"But I don't know, for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism. It helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere. The movie isn't always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague. < br / > < br / > The way this story is told isn't however the best. It also helps that they're being played by well cast actors.",1
"So, if you enjoy realistic, non - Hollywoodish, war movies : Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it! No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.",1
On a par with Das Boot. This movie does that.,1
"< br / > < br / > I'm surprised by the low rating on here! The plot of this film is ridiculous too. 7 out of 10 kids. I'd say this one is a must for gorehounds. What were you people expecting, "" The Exorcist? """,1
"Take time to watch it! < br / > < br / > The music is a blast, too.",1
What an uncompromising ending. A pie. Bloody marvelous.,1
"The NAZI's are all bad guys, I'm against them'( typical of German war movies ). By not talking too much about it, and just referring the war and the POW's. How? This goes for all the ranks, and in the end you see von Paulus giving example. Why do I say this? You easily see some of the German hierarchical relations, very different from the ones in US army.",1
This movie shares the cold with the book. A movie like this doesn't come along too often. Both will haunt me for rest of my life.,1
This movie shocked me.,1
"I just recently saw this movie in hopes of seeing an accurate portrayal of the bloodiest battle of the 20th Century. To make matters worse, the Russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the Germans. < br / > < br / > 1942 : World War II is in full swing. The Battle & Winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare but it also felt so real. Just to think I came across this movie by luck, before I had never even heard of it. A fateful move that ultimately dooms Nazi Germany to defeat. The battle soon turns into a blood bath of epic proportions, a nightmare for both the German & Russian soldiers fighting. < br / > < br / > This film is going to haunt me for a while.",1
Most other DVD'are multilingual. This is one of the best war films ever. Everything is accurate. Why not this one?,1
The acting is outstanding.,1
"No. So, what's so special? People are reduced to simple pawns, without power to change anything. < br / > < br / > "" Stalingrad "" is such a gem. The tragedy of the most bloody battle in the history is here. They do their duty and fight bravely. But underneath the splashy waves grow in silence, from time to time, less known pearls. But the real horror is elsewhere.",1
"< br / > < br / > Through the entire film, one feels the desperation of the entire battle. The film is about the battle of Stalingrad. Over 1 million people died in the course of the battle.",1
"< br / > < br / > The scripting, acting, direction and other film techniques in "" Stlingrad "" are of the highest caliber. Although filmed by Germans, "" Stalingrad "" is anything but a nationalistic apologetic film.",1
"The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The horror effects are extreme, terrifying, and unforgettable. It seems that a long - ago witch - hunt resulted in her suicide, and she was with child at the time. The lighting is excellent, and the set decoration is perfectly spooky.",1
"And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by repeating he is by no means a fascist. They are doomed to die ; it is clear from the very beginning. And “ Stalingrad ” is an exception. He also told me some anecdotes, not all he told me was gloomy. Probably when the lieutenant chokes back his tears at seeing Kolya ’ s execution. All that is shown in the film is quite different from what I ’ m used to. And to my mind it is true for spectators as well.",1
"The love story : that wasn't a love story. Death is the ultimate end to any story. I wouldn't necessarily call it "" anti - war "". ( Jarhead doesn't count ) The storyline is this. The fat cats weren't gonna go into Russia! Watch it as such.",1
"As a testament to the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the Eastern Front in the Second World War, it is a powerful one. There are a number of very powerful scenes in the film which help to capture the horror of war, such as the tank battle for instance. This is a film that I keep coming back to, for a variety of reasons.",1
"If you are a big fan of Karen Sillas, this is the film for you.",1
< br / > < br / > The story is fantastic. How far will Dave go to keep his secret?,1
"It's sad to say, but I think lots of men might feel this way. Definite recommend it! I thought it was an excellent movie.",1
"8 / 10. < br / > < br / > This was also based on true story which makes it all the more intriguing. Cole is believable and excellent in these roles. A fictional delusion, apparently.",1
"It didn't take long for Dave to find out that civilian life just doesn't appeal to him. The pressure of her nagging him got to the point where he just wanted to get lost and away from her and the kids. Davids actions are, even though unforgivable, understandable in the case of his depression over his marriage to Cindy. David then calls Alyson, who only met him once, and makes a date with her. But he should have sought professional David Bay & husband David Haywood. Back at Jackson AFB outside of Austin Tex. Gary Cole is very effective as both Master Sgt. Dave takes up the only job that he could do to support him and Alyson and their infant son Chris : using his skills he learned in the Red Berets to rob banks.",1
I did like this movie. It'a good rent.,1
At heart it's a haunted house horror but adds some gory deaths & a surreal feeling to everything.,1
"You could certainly do worse - - ever hear of the film "" Pod People ""?",1
Father Hood is an entertaining tale of an unwilling Father who is definitely a HOOD! His wife died while he was is prison and his two kids were put in foster care. Swayze is funny and rally does comedy pretty well! Diane Ladd plays Rita the con - artist mother of Jack Charles.,1
""" Father Hood "" is an overlooked little gem of a "" road movie "". It's worth the "" ride. """,1

I enjoyed this movie, but it was far from a masterpiece. < br / > < br / > BIRTHS : Richard Harris, Harold Pinter, Robert Atkins. It's Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail. In 1930, we are seeing many "" firsts "" but few "" bests. """,1
"Tyrone Power Sr. is the man leading the caravan, he is a rough and mean guy. The story is about the pioneers going from the Missouri to the west in Oregon.",1
"< br / > < br / > Today, it's unsettling to see the young Wayne carry a film, unencumbered by ego or mannerisms. They all journey together to blaze a trail for how movies would be made. The framing is limited to about belt - high and up - - no face close - ups.",1
"By time the settlers got to California I was exhausted. Ian Keith was a snake, but El Brendel is an acquired taste as the comic relief. No one said that in "" The Big Trail "" and I thought it would be a natural.",1
"Even on a television screen, the vistas were impressive. Subplots are few and simple. < br / > < br / > The Big Trail should be compulsory viewing. I first saw this film in video form.",1
"It has horror, action, and drama. Even for the eighties, this was an awesome film. What was up with all of those nasty "" B - movies "" she did?",1
Though I am not particularly a western movie buff. There is a sincere connection with nature.,1
"Nothing is overstated or overplayed. < br / > < br / > The plot of revenge and romance is played well. I have never seen wagons that were so real! The more I see big budget movies of the silent era, the more I like them. Every speck of dirt, every scratch, every splinter was there.",1
"Quite an innovation but also something that really stretched the talents of the sound technicians! < br / > < br / > As for the acting, it was pretty good. Unfortunately, CIMARRON isn't all that great a film and I actually like THE BIG TRAIL more due to the scope of the film. This was a major break for young John Wayne - - as his previous screen appearances were, at best, minor and unremarkable. My giving this film a score of 8 is relative to other feature - length films from 1930.",1
"The horses and mules have to be lowered to the river level and the wagons let down by ropes and pulley. < br / > < br / > Melodrama aside, this picture is as authentic in dress and style as they come and worth watching for that alone.",1
"Much of the film was shot outdoors, and the movie has a truly epic feel about it. He nearly steals the whole picture. The wagons, the clothing, every single detail looks and feels right.",1
"Very typical of Walsh are a number of shots towards the beginning, such as the one where a woman is chopping firewood. The extra width becomes just that extra. He makes great use of the wider frame to show off the Western landscape at its most breathtaking. Thanks to a recent DVD release we now get to see the widescreen version alongside the fullscreen that was shot simultaneously. It may seem logical at first, because it means that height - wise we see as much of the actors as we would in a fullscreen picture.",1
< br / > < br / > Thousands will fill every seat... many thousands will line Hollywood Boulevard to watch the gala festivities attending this world premiere!,1
"Later, Indians gather west of the train to combat them. One of the best westerns I have seen. The film is done in 70 mm widescreen at about a 2. 0 : 1 ratio ( in 1930! ).",1
"), burly and uncouth villain ( played by Tyrone Power Sr.!",1
i really liked this film. it features John Wayne in his first starring performance.,1
"The magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer. He robs them of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritance. < br / > < br / > Possible lesson < br / > < br / > 3. Something like : "" Is Killinggänget now taking off Nazism? "" < br / > < br / > 2. During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it.",1
"< br / > < br / > The acting is quite acceptable throughout. It's an awesome, amazing film. I just recently bought "" The Big Trail "" { 1930 }. Examples are the crossing of the river, the Indian battle, and traversing the burning Desert. Well, you have only half the team here, but the entire Myth is present.",1
< br / > < br / > It still takes my breath away. Certainly the finest film on that path I ever saw. that subject ever filmed.,1
And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! The text boards bringing the story along reinforced that impression I suppose. An amazing film to have been made with that technique and under those conditions 1930.,1
No studio product here with a backlot western set. And of course both films were done on location and show the expense in making them. < br / > < br / > But we're here to talk about The Big Trail. He wanted to make him the lead in a big budget western that Fox was planning to do.,1
"Slick cardsharp Ian Keith is a sophisticated bad guy. Silent movie character actor Tully Marshall is impressive as a wily old mountain man who helps guide the wagon train. Walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use wide screen. Notice during the crowd scenes, how everyone is busy doing real work, which adds so much to the verisimilitude of these sequences. Marguerite Churchill is fetching as a lovely Southern belle who slowly warms to the Duke's attentions. He fills the screen, every portion of it, with action.",1

"Debra Messing was adorable, and Candice Bergen was fantastic. Yes, the casting decisions may seem strange, but they WORK. Women will understand.

Let's face it Meg looks much better with long hair. I am a 58 year old man. It was great to finally see Meg Ryan looking super again. It won't disappoint. Candice Bergen is showing her age as is Carrie Fisher. The NYC scenes were nice to see. So I gave this chick flick a 9.,1
I would not compare to it totally. Just an enjoyable lighthearted comedy.,1
Most of the comments so far have nailed this one right on the head. < br / > < br / > The cast is composed largely of veterans who know their way around a well - written script. Is the premise wildly original? The sharp dialog is effortlessly and effectively delivered by these pros.,1

"< br / > < br / > I managed to watch the subtitled version of this last year and was pleased by the story and plot. Although not lonely, Sosuke is just like any other curious boy who likes adventure and allure of the sea. That coupled with his characteristic use of character development and often using girls and women as main characters. < br / > < br / > What does come across well is Miyazaki's very elaborate and magical animation and story that has elements of wonder and fantasy. Miyazaki has claimed that "" this is my last movie "" for many years but shortly after Spirited Away, he gave us Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo is no exception. This should not detract you from watching this fun film of growth, hope, and friendship. For the same reason Pom Poko is VERY "" Japanese "" and doesn't make much sense to US audiences, so too are * some * elements of Ponyo.",1
"It is far from it, and it can be easily described as a captivating, beautiful movie experience. It's just that good. He accomplished this perfectly, and he also didn't lose any substance along the way, which is the reason it gets a 10. < br / > < br / > Miyazaki has indeed another masterpiece. Ponyo is not too difficult to understand or comprehend.",1
Other than that the movie was great and I highly recommend it. The story is simple but fairly well written and played out. Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a beautifully animated film and a relief from the many heartless soulless CGI movies being made. The movie did seem to end abruptly though. ( The Radish Spirit.,1
Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo is such a film. < br / > < br / > Ponyo is a very rich film.,1

"The fanciful little goldfish, Brunhild, leaves her ocean home on a jellyfish. com ). Making her a loving, sensible, modern mother both to Sosuke and Ponyo. He cuts his hand when breaking the jar open to free the little goldfish. Miyazaki has created another strong, independent, female character in Lisa.",1
"She is a large goldfish who already looks like a pretty red - haired girl. But quite frankly, Ponyo's exploratory curiosity is as strong as her amorous nature.",1
< br / > < br / > ( No. Few would argue that master animation director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability. He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker.,1
"The effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to American audiences and Disney is getting close. < br / > < br / > "" Ponyo "" is the story of a bug - eyed childish - looking fish of the same name, the daughter of an undersea sorcerer, who longs to escape the sea and become a little girl. It's a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable, aiming for charm instead of conflict. < br / > < br / > But voices are of little significance in a Miyazaki film, which is all about visual creativity. When she does, she quickly befriends a young boy named Sosuke.",1
"Okay, you don't need to read any further now. They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with. Ponyo swerves away from many of the problems that all - age films tackle. Ponyo brings everyone back to that world.",1
"From the East end to the vibrant centre with its music scene as well as'special little retreats'for Londoners. Other than that, there are some great comments by Londoners and excellent shots.",1
"An age bracket much younger than that of Tonarino Totoro ( My Neighbor Totoro ). < br / > < br / > The fact that a villain is not present really surprised me, other than the father and maybe that crazy - ass typhoon. Also, I believe this movie is based on simplicity and creative animation ; straight - up grass roots Ghibli Studios style. And I believe the most simple way I can answer to this, is that it's a movie for a much, much younger age bracket.",1
"Stranded ashore, she is rescued by Sosuke ( Hiroki Doi ), a five - year old boy who, along with his mom Risa ( Tomoko Yamaguchi ), resides in a house on the nearby cliff. With Sosuke'help, Ponyo must pass a test to lift this curse and completely become a human. It's a straightforward tale that, though at times stalled by its tendency to ramble like a toddler, keeps in tune with its youthful pedigree to magically enthrall. """,1
"I wanted to live in this world and never leave. Where the film really comes alive, though, is in its tremendous artwork. The story is simple and cute.",1
"I won't give you anymore details, you'll have to see film for yourself. I loved it!",1
"Don't get me wrong, PONYO is not a bad movie by any means. He separates the pair and tries to talk Ponyo into staying underwater with him. His newest film, PONYO, an unashamedly family - friendly tale of a "" goldfish out of water "", is as lushly animated and alive with interesting characters as you would expect... and yet this is the first film of his which treads into "" lesser "" territory. The problem is that the story doesn't stay afloat to satisfy anyone eager for another engrossing, in - depth plot. As mentioned, it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as TOTORO and KIKI. Not really, but it is impossible to expect everyone of his movies to always be five star marvels.",1
It did and he named it'Ponyo'( Yuria Nara ). It is of the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. He then checks inquisitively to see if the'goldfish'is still alive.,1

"If you've never seen a Miyazaki film before, then it will probably confuse the heck out of you. There was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for the backgrounds. But, because it is so hard to describe ( and others have already done so ), I won't even go there. But, like these and many other Studio Gibli films, if you just sit back and watch you are rewarded with a fabulous tale. I have a strong feeling that what you think of this film will strongly depend on your frame of reference.",1
"However Ponyo is a whole different type of story and animation all together. can Ponyo really stay with Sousuke forever? I have recently watched this film, and have decided to comment on it.",1
"Two thumbs up, way up!",1
This is a must - see movie.,1
"Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "" Gake No Ue No Ponyo "" ( Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea ) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood. Ponyo is definitely not your typical goldfish and soon begins to adapt and take on human aspects ( she develops human speech and an appetite for ham meat ) by sampling some blood from a cut on Sosuke's finger.",1
"In any case, this movie is still must - watch for fans of anime or Miyazaki.",1
The movie's secret is brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters. but that makes them all more endearing. I find myself singing the cute theme song all the time as will anyone who sees this movie!,1
"Ponyo may at times feel so unique and fresh, it may feel alien like. < br / > < br / > In terms of audience age range, it is probably pre Totoro. Too often our judgement are impeded by our own limitations of cinematic and cultural standing. It would be a big pity for Wall - E to win over this one at the Oscars, and it probably will this year. It is perhaps comforting to know that good old fashioned hand drawn cells still work so incredibly well in this digital era where Toystory / WallE / Shrek / Cars generally triumph.",1
"Saying anything more would be to spoil the fun. And you can expect some moments of throwback to likes of The Little Mermaid, or Splash made for kids.",1
"However, two elements were lacking : a deep story and dramaturgy. As a long - time fan of Studio Ghibli and especially Hayao Miyazaki films, I went to the film right on the opening day.",1
"She meets up again with Sousuke in a storm and the story continues from there in many interesting ways. I gave the movie a ten out of ten rating. Joe Hisaishi, once again, provided outstanding musical support. There is a cuteness factor in this film rivaling and arguably surpassing that of Tonari no Totoro. Miyazaki, who shows no fear of having a busy scene, has outdone himself. There were literally hundreds of individually - drawn sea creatures of every imaginable size all in motion at the same time. The boy names fish Ponyo.",1

"So do what you can to take the time to check out this movie, I can almost be sure it won't be waste of time. So I decided to watch it. As a general comment... Then one morning when I woke up early, I saw that it was just about to start.",1
i believed it. this movie really moved me. this is what confuses me about critics and their opinion. the acting was top class.,1
I just saw this movie tonight.,1
The acting is superb throughout with special mention to a few. Sometimes all we want to do is end the suffering. Emotions don't need to be worn on one's sleeve to exist. The film is a catharsis for souls of those affected by the horrific event of Leland killing his ex - girlfriend's mentally challenged brother.,1
aka - Don't BE IGNORANT,1
Even for altruistic reasons? Leland is very perceptive.,1
"My vote is seven. < br / > < br / > "" The United States of Leland "" is a depressive and interesting study of a character.",1
give it time and appreciate a good movie. recommend as a buy or at least a rent. good movie.,1
"Wonderfully cast, no over acting or Cliché performance or plot.",1
"His motive of committing murder is left incompletely explained, and it makes viewers think. Acting was pretty much flawless, and the cast was very good, it contains many familiar faces.",1
"I highly recommend it. The supporting cast is terrific as well. He is intelligent, yettoic. I like the way that he narrates the film with his journal.",1
I just came back from seeing this awesome movie! !,1
"But the real flavorings come out when we immerse ourselves in the Pollards, the family of the retarded child. And the movie takes a good look at what goes into those choices, and the consequences of them. Spacey. The issue is not whether he did it or not Leland admits to it, straight away but rather, why. Even Chris Klein these < br / > < br / > And Leland features the required indie group of screwed - up people. We meet Leland's distant and egotistical father ( Kevin Spacey in an extended cameo ), who never seems emotionally stirred in any way by what his son did.",1
A sociopath is a person who is not completely formed.,1
His own father is an aloof man who couldn't care less about him. The ensemble cast does good work under Mr. Hoge's direction.,1
"< br / > < br / > Great movie. See it for yourself. I will not give the plot in this post, I think others have beat me to it already. 9 out of 10 stars I enjoyed it greatly and hope that you will too. I am still lost in thought, attempting to answer my many questions from the film.",1
High recommended. Chris Klein gives his best performance to date. You'll think and talk about this film for days.,1
"Nothing it solid, it's not definite, it's about what the individual viewer takes out of it. The movie personifies Leland in a way. There are subtleties in this film that I think a lot of people may miss if they're not careful.",1
"Don Cheadle was also fantastic. The film presented an interesting view on life and death. Before I saw this film, I read the comment of someone who wasn't very fond of it. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a film that reckless of whether or not you like it, you should see it.",1
I've read that the character of Leland was flawed. Ryan Gosling deserves to be talked about. I am no Ebert.,1
"There is a whole lot more to what happened then what is on the surface. Perhaps there is no simple question to be answered here? The film does not seek to rationalize what happens, but rather understand the why. This irritates many, I am sure. Well, that status - quo theme is kind of what the movie is parodying. I was looking at the external reviews ( Ebert, etc. ) I strongly believe people should view this film, with an open mind. They want blame to be cast and resolved. Somehow, Gosling is able to make killer of an autistic child sympathetic.",1
But Pearl also wants to understand Leland's motivation and takes him under his wing as a confidante in the prison. This is simply not a black - and - white movie.,1
There'big things for her in the future - I can see it.,1
"to say the least. But if you do watch it... you just might find something yourself. After watching, this movie, in my opinion, is definitely worth seeing. I read only the plot premise and became intrigued. < br / > < br / > In short, it is a well acted, well directed movie. I'd suggest skipping this one.",1
"His father lives in Europe and doesn't really care much about his son. All the problems depicted in story are very real. < br / > < br / > In this movie, there is no bad guy. Instead, we sit back, relax, and watch this boy's life unfold throughout the corse of the movie. 'There is a why, but we don't find out about it until the end. Leland notices things that people tend to ignore. Maybe this is something that just happened. 'he doesn't have an answer. This is one movie which will leave you thinking in the end, and wondering about how it all works. When pressured with the question'Why? There is no one you can blame for anything that happens.",1
"It'll be up to his loyal (.. and startlingly intelligent ) and fast - thinking dog Gromit to save the day. Here, we get a full feature with witty humor and some wild stunts featuring marvelous animation, not to mention gut - busting sight gags.",1
The plot of the movie is straightforward enough but the beauty of the W & G films for me is the background gags.,1
And of course Peter Sallis provides the voice of Wallace again and is a perfect fit. < br / > < br / > On the negative side this film is a little on the long side.,1
And suddenly no vegetable in town is safe! The business is a great success - - but Wallace proves a bit too clever for his own good. Greatly recommended!,1
"< br / > < br / > Wallace and Gromit are respectively master and pooch. For the record, "" The Curse of Were - Rabbit "" took five years to make.",1
< br / > < br / > The humor itself was very funny.,1
Have fun!,1
"? I was extremely amused to read some of the bad reviews on this movie. are normal themes, no harm done. Many people have also complained that it goes very very slowly.... And how can people complain about the jokes?",1
"In fact, she's much better. Anywhere But Here is my favorite drama. I cried. < br / > < br / > I loved this movie. The Matrix is my favorite sci - fi movie. She did a simply amazing job.",1
"What is interesting in this movie, is trying to identify : who is more entrepreneurial, Wallace or Gromit?",1
"But this one caught me by surprise. Great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun. Give it a shot! Going into this movie, I was a bit cautious.",1
"It's fresh, funny and amazingly clever. First, the voice actors do a great job. Much of the reason is that the film is fun and quite original.",1
"In this case they've invented a machine that can capture all of the bunnies that are eating up the crops all over a quiet English village. It'never less than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use, even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny "" ho - ho "" not funny "" ha - ha "" side ( a tired criticism but I'll say it ). Granted, the Aardman guys ( Nick Park and Steve Box ) have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material.",1
"They are doing a good job, but soon, there is danger afoot.",1
"Who can ask for more? Any film that takes 5 (! ) Maybe. Too many sex references? Too young. At least for the moment Regardless, W & G is a film well made. < br / > < br / > Too much adult humour?",1
You too should see it.,1
#NAME?,1
"I loved Gromit, and I think he is one of the coolest dogs I already saw.",1
"It's a hoot, and great for the whole family! The workmanship with the clay characters really stands out.",1
! Its tears that blend everyone around you together more! Being 15 myself I enjoyed this flick thouroughly!,1
"The animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful. Wallace and Gromit has not changed. Well done, Nick. Hooray, Wallace and Gromit. It is a well done film that should get an Oscar next year. But Wallace had an idea. It's up to Wallace and Gromit to save the day. As a fan of these two characters, I was impressed.",1
"The color was magnificent, too. < br / > < br / > The best part of the film, however, is the clever comedy woven throughout. This was very good, except for two things which I'll mention at the end. It's just a funny exaggerated look at the oddball "" Wallace "" and his silent - and - smart dog "" Gromit. """,1
"Curse of Were Rabbit is witty, English, and intelligent. The film is a lot like our two heroes ; simple and unassuming. < br / > < br / > Wallace and Gromit are very English. but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment.",1
"< br / > < br / > Nick Park, the creator of the animated team of Wallace & Gromit, is a genius. Crackin'Good Entertainment!",1
"The first is subtlety and observation, the flagship of which is the character of Gromit. < br / > < br / > Watching the movie you have to be aware of the entire screen. The comedy and the emotion is conveyed through the subtlest of movements and it works superbly well. This is what shows in his movies, and in through his most beloved characters. You can imagine that inside Park is the mind of Wallace.",1
"I really refused to see this movie. It came up on the screen "" Few "" as in a few tickets left. It was amazing. Then again, Were - Rabbits and WereWolves aren't actual creatures. I wont say anymore. It goes way above their heads.",1
"Thanks to the tedious process, it took FIVE YEARS to finish the film! This one is jolly good. I say jolly good, ol'chap.",1
"Helena Bonham Carter was terrific as the lovely Lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. THE MOON!!! "" < br / > < br / > The characters are crisp and hilarious. When word gets out about a "" Were - Rabbit "" eating all the vegetables in town, a frenzy ensues. It has an excellent Voice cast, humorous jokes and good animation as only Aardman could do! Vintage Aardman! ).",1
Wallace and Gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever crafted. This film will be a delight for both kids and parents.,1
"Charming, clever, fun and well made, what'not to enjoy? This is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy.",1
"< br / > < br / > It's a very funny and colorful story. Enjoy! ), will love this full - length movie. This is where W & G come in. Unfortunately the town is plagued by lots of hungry rabbits. It really completes ride.",1
"From my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year. Chicken Run "" had the more convenient, but also more "" storytelling "" plot. I saw it at a German press screening. Here, you are already able to know the two main characters. < br / > < br / Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more "" isolated "" feeling of the W + G shorts.",1
"Some wonderfully colourful local characters decorate the tale, and the film is pure delight. Imagine that, a real girl in a movie, whatever next? But are they being properly released? There he falls in love with alluring Macdonald lass, and she reciprocates the affection.",1
"They are given the task of building a rocket post box that will enable the islanders to communicate with the mainland. < br / > < br / > Fine cinematography and a brilliant central theme song sung in the local dialect round out this movie. < br / > < br / > Intelligent but undemanding, it is good for quiet evening in.",1
"As implausible as it seems, this film was based on actual story.",1
All in all I thought it was a pretty good movie.,1
"Nice eerily ambiguous ending, too. Strother Martin delivers a wonderfully wicked and robust performance as Doc Duncan, who's the gleefully sinister leader of the evil sect. Worse yet, there's a pernicious Satanic cult that's been abducting little children for their own diabolical purposes.",1
"! On the back of the pack it read, in so many words.... plant these seeds at midnight. on the front. < br / > < br / > Turn out the lights, put in the DVD, make a sandwich, and watch this movie.",1
"And I think that is great. < br / > < br / > A good film. Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to see the movie.",1
One hellva movie! What an actor!,1
"Not everyone likes this movie. It worked in this case, too. McEveety was seldom given a big budget but was often effective. Also, speaking as someone who actually KNOWS Satanists, the (poiler warning! )",1
"Jaime Mendoza - Navas'music is subtly sinister and gives it that extra sense of eeriness. To top that off, children are disappearing and adults are being murdered at an alarming rate.",1
< br / > < br / > The story is not that good. Still this movie does work. A 7. A family is traveling through the mid West. It'a quiet kind of horror that isn't made anymore.,1
"Beautifully shot film, too. The villagers behave very hostile and insist the visitors on leaving right away. I really liked "" Brotherhood of Satan "" a lot.",1
"offer solid support as the no - nonsense sheriff and his comic - strip aficionado assistant. ; luckily, the DVD has been re - issued at bargain - price - and I'm sure glad I picked it up! < br / > < br < br / > < br / > Anyway, this is one strange film, and a genuine sleeper : initially confusing but striking occult tale which manages to hit bullseye with respect to both its forbidding small - town atmosphere and the inherent eeriness of the sinister goings - on.",1
Seems like the children have been disappearing. And Strother Martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing double duty unbeknown to his fellow townsfolk. 8 out of 10.,1
The Acting is excellent!. This is one creepy underrated Gem with chilling performances and a fantastic finale!. Ther is a little bit of blood and gore. Strother Martin is fantastic here!,1
It is a truly humbling experience. The control of her emotions are so in tact that at any point in the movie she can tap into them and release an unforgettable scene.,1
"Given the IMDb rating of 4. I couldn't'have been more wrong. The scene where the men are discussing their plan of action in the sheriff's office is amazing. The unknown helps make for a far creepier atmosphere than most similar films. A lesser film would have tried to pull out all the stops and would, most likely, have failed miserably. Not here. What I got instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast I really enjoyed. We see all five men at once each doing their own thing as in real life. The ending is effective with its surreal imagery.",1
Absolutely recommended. Check out this forgotten gem of satani horror. What is the cause of hysteria?,1
I can't remember that one. Man! long live to him.,1
"< br / > < br / > The sound effects were amazing, the music was great, the theme song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful. B serve to protect New Texas from the evil Tex Hex and his band of outlaws. Something of which the same cannot be said about today's cartoons, sadly.",1
"The action scenes are stiff, almost too staged.",1
dk with'Himmelskibet'to get more info. I saw this film from 1918 recently at our local Helsinkian film archive.,1
"The spaceship's crew consist of seven thin guys and one fat slob. What a great movie! Guess which one cracks. Of course, the plot is simplistic. Even the Martians.",1
But I can't leave! Here's an idea : Go outside. It'A GOOD SHOW.,1
"The show then has 2 separate skits divided by commercials. As for Mencia being offensive he is only speaking his mind. I find nothing wrong with that. < br / > < br / > The show is not perfect. < br / > < br / > Mencia has no problem doing jokes about any race, religion, sex, or orientation.",1
"If you like Gary Cooper, this is one of his best roles.",1
Susan Sarandon. The movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral. She really acted as though she were Adele August. She made this movie for me.,1
< br / > < br / > This movie was made in 1950. Gary Cooper is a cool headed guy.,1
"7 / 10 Dallas stars Gary Cooper, Ruth Roman, Steve Cochran, Barbara Payton & Raymond Massey. It's true he isn't really asked to do anything more than be a laconic dude on a mission. < br / > < br / > It has ideals to being an A list Oater does Dallas, something it just can't quite attain. It's directed by Stuart Heisler, photography is from Ernest Haller & pen duties fell to John Twist.",1
Good entertainment.,1
"I could have sworn that they were my own family, no joke.",1
This film was great!,1
Weaver's and Hirsch's acting is believable and helps make the movie what it is.,1
"Enjoyed this film which deals entirely about an average family, so it appears.",1
"Highly Recommended. Grady Harp Secrets and lies, here, and the resolution of them is painfully dramatic. IMAGINARY HEROES is one fine little film!",1
"I found the move an insightful examination of tragedy. And, I'm glad I did.",1
He is a chameleon never the same. I have seen her in I did not even know who he was in this movie. Markerson who plays Nanny is also very good. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I never seen him play a bad part yet. Where is this mans Oscar? Halle Berry even produced it. Yes let's round up all the black folks in Hollywood and put them in one movie. He was in Shaft and he stole the movie.,1
"Downplayed just perfectly and understated. Unlike some others, I did NOT find this @ all predictable.",1
"Did his mom think so too? Ben's mourning was much more clear. She was born in 1949. Ms Weaver must be dancing a jig. The young man playing Tim was outstanding. Sorry. Still, a very watchable film.",1
"! gaga for it, even with all its plot twists... but the one thing i found really disturbing was the connection between the two best friends in Tim and Kyle.",1
A most meaningful film and a must see. A big bravo to all involved.,1
"< br / > < br / > After you've seen liked those, check out this one. Without intent perhaps, the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two aforementioned movies too much. Of note is Emile Hirsch who would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding "" Into The Wild "". Here, the writing cannot measure with that of American Beauty.",1
"In almost next scene, Daniels asks Sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday. This seems to have been the goal of director / writer Dan Harris. But "" Imaginary Heroes "" is a good effort. The script could have been sharper. So what is Ben looking at?",1
And the depiction of a disturbed family dynamic isn't depicted as strongly as the many other films out there with similar ideas. Michelle Williams'older sister Penny is underwritten and could easily be taken out of the film.,1
"Why This simple line of advice from Penny serves as the movie's central theme, responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure. The film focuses on Tim. Everyone who loves him hurts him.",1
"It's not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious films to explore. Each of the remaining family members copes with the tragedy in his or her own way. Ben, the father, becomes swallowed up in feelings of remorse and guilt, turning away from both his job and his family. Far from it.",1
The Kinks warned about media heroes. ).,1
"I never thought I'd watch it... nevermind like it. < br / > < br / > The story is based on a book, and you can tell. 110 minutes later I am still interested. How could this be?",1
"That's how this film fails to be a somber version of'American Beauty ', with a different focus. I am sure however that we will hear a lot about Dan Harris in the coming years.",1
Imaginary Heroes is clearly the best film of the year. It should be seen. The cast was amazing. I was riveted.,1
I can't wait until it comes out in theaters. Wow.,1
"This film is a powerful commentary on family life in North America today. I would be surprised if others didn't recognize it as such. Well done! < br / > < br / > Our imaginary heroes, through a myriad of innocent circumstances, often unwittingly, lead us down a path of sorrow, confusion and isolation. < br / > < br / > Clearly 10.",1
"Will try to see it again, time allowing. The movie is really in my head right now - - saw it this morning. This film is chock - full of little surprises, many of them funny. Very realistic.",1
"I thought the acting was excellent, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hih. Heavy film! Clever dialogue, and situations. The relatively "" uplifting "" ending gave hope for those affected by the initial tragedy.",1
"In this case, the censors seem to have exercised extremely poor judgment. < br / > < br / > Were my junior high - school class have been shown this film, two suicides may have been prevented.",1
Not since Doctor Strangelove has nuclear war been so hilarious! Recommended.,1
< br / > < br / > The art is delightfully raw. I love it. Thank you NFB for letting it be made.,1
"The wife leaves for a while to vacuum her bed and bathtub (! ) In this one, a couple are playing Scrabble. before catching her husband looking at her side.",1
I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. She sees that the mother doesn't get it.,1
What more could you want in a film?,1
This is a very strange little short film that initially didn't impress me. The film deserves kudos for both being unique as well as very funny.,1
"... the world may never know. Both are available on Expanded Entertainment's "" World's Greatest Animation "" compilation, in case you'd like to compare. ) That shot has never failed to affect me that way since.",1
"< br / > < br / > It is flawless... in every way. This film at first seems just like a simple exercise in cartoon slapstick humour, but it is far more than that.",1
"Darn tootin '. Condie loads this fella up with countless visual gags and memorable catch - phrases. And did I mention it was nominated for an Academy Award? Richard Condie is a Canadian marvel, and one that should be shared with the world.",1
This film is all about humans.,1
Blind to an inevitable apocalypse. This is tale of beautiful futility. Sheffield.,1
This is a masterpiece.,1
of course robin williams is excellent. this film makes you think.,1
"His death is tragic cliché almost always seen in movies like this one, but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this. Not great, but Anywhere But Here is definitely worth a look.",1
"It is what makes him very appealing to the people in the film and in real life. What makes him so appealing is his humanity and likability. His humour is like barbed wire, and yet it is cathartic.",1
"In addition to that, she quickly takes a liking to Dobbs. He's clearly the underdog in this election. < br / > < br / > It's an entertaining film, and it has a good message. ( Big Surprise! ) Think Daily Show With John Stuart. But, it never got boring. Overall I give it a 7 / 10.",1
Great Film! Our election process is unclothed and dismal. was refreshing or would've been when Clinton was President.,1
I really don't know how to classify this film. It felt like I was watching two movies.,1
Not every line in a comedy is funny. The script writers here could give Fox News some lessons in fair and balanced.,1
I enjoyed it and thanks to IMDb. Of course Hollywood uses movies with hidden or not - so - hidden agendas. Rent it if that doesn t match you.,1
Stop the Disney ending and putting a bow on it. Let us debate it.,1
It makes you laugh instantly and remain in thought afterwards.,1
Comedian to President - Elect.,1
Chick Flick? Yes..... Worth watching? Many times.... You bet!,1
Oddly the only person of honesty is someone not even elected to the position and tells the truth in the end. Leaves a lot for thought. Overall I enjoyed it.,1
And it was funny.,1
"But shockingly we wins and makes a mockery of the office. "" - * * * The two seem to have a great chemistry and work off each other.",1
Would we elect comedian? The movie has heart.,1
"So much of what we see and hear in regards to any election is such a joke. I encourage anyone who thinks our process is fine to go see this film. In this movie they show us that the truth hurts, not that the truth is funny.",1
I completely disagree with the other comments! Robin Williams is in top form.,1
"I always wonder how some people are film marketers when I see how misleading their marketing campaigns. "" I kind of wonder in this case if the marketing was done on purpose since this film addresses pretty serious issues in - between its comedy routine. < br / > < br / > I really liked "" Man of the Year "" even though I was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious film. One day on his show, a fan from the audience raises the idea that Dobbs should run for President of the United States.",1
So is Letterman. Leno talks through his punch lines. I never got a single email.,1
Nope. She basically steals the film. And the same goes with Dave. There's a couple comedians who can do dead - on impersonations of Jay. I'd rather they had Norm McDonald play the part.,1
Letterman and Leno themselves had objections. I remember this movie getting a lot of flak from reviewers when it was new. < br / > < br / > They could have done more with Johnny's role in all this.,1
They seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family.,1
"Once you realize this, then much of the machinations in the film become irrelevant. And David Letterman is not. The hard and simple truth is exactly as one NBC exec stated in the film "" Jay Leno is the funniest man in America. "" This is a clever and entertaining film about the backroom battling that went on to choose a successor to Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show.",1
"After the five minutes it fills the screen properly, left to right. As if.",1
"< br / > < br / > The performances are also very good. I suppose if one has not watched David Letterman or Jay Leno, The Late Shift might not ).",1
"Watching him really was like watching Letterman. His whole "" look "" seemed fake, and he just didn't seem natural in the role. The book is certainly stronger than the movie.",1
"I respectfully disagree. This was Johnny Carson! Overall, the movie is hilarious, and I wish that it were shown more often. The relationship with Kushnick bordered on something akin to domestic violence.",1
"Nonetheless, the piece is an excellent one, as far as television and video are concerned. Two - the distribution of the foul language. I only have two minor quips about the film, as subtle as they are.",1
Clearly there's no business like show business. And by the way Rich Little was terrific as Johhny Carson his portrayal couldn't be matched.,1
! The story is what counts. There should be sequel!,1
9 rating seems unfair my opinion.,1
"If this should ever be released on DVD, I would certainly add it to my collection.",1
"Bates commands the screen in one of her best, if not so well - known performances as venomous Hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast.",1
"as a former TV editor, I can say this is as authentic as it gets.",1
Captivating tale of backstabbing behind the curtains. < br / > < br / > John Michael Higgins ( Letterman ) plays his part to tee.,1
I visited Loretto Chapel. NM.,1
Excellent story with supper acting by all of the cast.,1
"William Petersen is perfect, as always. I really would love to see it again. This movie left me speechless and in tears. Is that possible with television movies?? I saw this movie when it aired on Lifetime back in 2004. !",1
< br / > < br / > Just a wonderful story.,1
99! I have to keep writing to get this posted.,1
"I have always liked Susan Sarandon, and I think she is grossly underrated. Clashes inevitably ensue, and they are engagingly presented. it is as if I am living their lives, feeling what they are feeling.",1
The accent came and went unfortunately which I found more than a little distracting. Lots of special moments.,1
Then see the staircase in person! See movie - it is GREAT!,1
"But the storyline, and it's several plots, of how it came to be is what most captivates you. The screen play was excellent, as well the supporting cast. I subscribe to Dish. For you who have seen film, you know what I'm talking about. an angel?",1
But altogether recommended ( but not for kids ).,1
That alone makes it worth your.,1
Eastwood and Malkovich are superb. Russo has a way of getting your attention.,1
"This goes for both his acting and his directing. Editing and cinematography are good. Eastwood tends to be great, sometimes excellent.",1
9 / 10. This film succeeds on several levels.,1
"This is a Hollywood film. Russo is a calm, capable agent who is able to go toe - to - toe with the quick - witted Horrigan in friendly banter.",1
"Unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost dooms the President, which is an authentic touch. With Eastwood, if he lifts an eyebrow by a millimeter, watch out! My'guardian angel ', whose name is Vigil, enjoyed this movie even more than I did, but then bodyguard movies are very much his thing. What a good'un. This film was made when both Eastwood and Malkovich were at their peak. I wonder if anyone else noticed the humour of those noises having been added. Of course, he is the master of the super - cool.",1
"I don't think it was the script writer's fault. 7 / 10 Bethany Cox. All in all, watchable certainly but maybe more for an older audience.",1
"7 / 10 This is one of his good films, focused and playing director Petersen's game. Pretty much as you'd expect but well - handled.",1
"It has Rene Russo as the'love interest. Don't miss! 'It has twists and turns, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. This one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller! I really love action / adventure films and this is one of the best.",1
< br / > < br / > Clint Eastwood is no one special me. Malkovich is a tremendous actor and incredibly versatile. You have to wait for the build up and the ending and it will pay off in the end. The characters he plays are simplistic and one - dimensional.,1
"Thrillers don't get much better th this, don't miss it.",1
What a movie! Wow!,1
"It felt like a true story. To sum up, I love this film because it has a mind.",1
"Yet, it's not an excellent movie. There's a reason why he got an Academy Award nomination. The stakes? They're never at the best of their abilities.",1
"John Malkovich earned a deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. < br / > < br / > But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He calls Eastwood throughout the film and taunts him. And after a while what Malkovich says and does causes Clint to get real personal. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency.",1
"This is one more example. Now there is an intense actor! The climatic scene, in particularly, had too many holes in it.",1
"Eastwood goes to town to make himself a great presence in the film, however, and under the circumstances the character seems tailor made for him.",1
"She is one of most talented actresses I ever saw, and so is Sarandon. They really look like mother daughter. The movie is incredible.",1
I give this one 10 Stars! ).,1
Thirty years later another anti - social lunatic wants to assassinate the current president.,1
"He looked good in the tuxedo he wore near the end of the film, though. One thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines. As for Leary ( John Malkovich ), he was a sick man who loved to toy with Frank by phone.",1
He gives pompous speeches Who could? Clint's acting range by now is pretty familiar. We know from his newfound resolve that given another chance he would take the bullet this time. He's tested again halfway through this movie.,1
"Who will die? Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat on the President by a "" wacko "". But one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious. It's a race against time to save Pres from a chameleon - like enemy who can get to anyone. My favorite Secret Service movie and as good a nail biter as any. But this killer has turned the tables on Horrigan and now he's the hunted one in a life or death cat and mouse game.",1
Top notch movie. Eastwood and Peterson should team together more often. Clint Eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993.,1
"! Quite simply a well - made, well - written and wonderfully acted movie.",1
Wolfgang Peterson ratchet up the tension and we feel every turn. In The Line of Fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse. He questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this riveting film.,1
I absolutely LOVED the film! Portman was also excellent as Ann. It would be a shame if they were overlooked. I think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman.,1
This was a great movie.,1
"However, the film doesn't make him a depressed, brooding, and obsessed character. Why? It's fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it! He even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth. - It's GOOD!",1
It is somewhat unlike any of the typical Lewis films.,1
"And I'm not joking! Be careful though, you might die laughing. If you only see one more comedy in your life, see this one.",1
"But even more interesting and important, he does it in a very un - American way.",1
"A sick man Carleton Hendricks ( Dee Snider ), cruises the Teen Chat lines as Captain Howdy. He poses as a teenage boy and invites other teens over his house to party. < br / > < br / > The acting varies. Four years later he's released... totally cured. He captures the daughter of cop Mike Gage ( Kevin Gage ). I give it a 7. I was cringing away from the TV during most of the scenes. There's no humor and the ( muted ) screams of his victims sound way too real. But a lynch mop ( led, amusingly, by Robert Englund ) attack him and hang him. Dee Snider is very scary as Captain Howdy - - his attack scenes are not pleasant.",1
Recommen for fans of Saw. My question is ; why? I think this movie is pretty good.,1
"This is the one thing she knows how to do without fail. < br / > < br / > Adele, who is solidly portrayed by Susan Sarandon, did not come off as a very likable character. I did enjoy the movie, but was probably expecting too much. My one - line summary hints that this is not a good film, but this is not true.",1
I didn't really think this movie was bad. The make - up artist did a great job. Capt. I enjoyed Strangeland.,1
! Dee Snider was inspired to do a two part song by a horror movie.,1
"Honestly, this is one of the BEST horror movies I have ever seen. < br / > < br / > As a big horror movie fan, I highly recommend this film. I was captivated by the story, petrified of Captain Howdy and on the edge of my seat for the whole ride. I don't really understand all the negative reviews. By the second act, however, things have changed a little. It is terrifying to find yourself cheering for "" bad "" guy. It is the first horror movie EVER to give me nightmares.",1
"And it * does * happen in the real world. Which is what makes this movie such a sensitive subject for many. I personally loved the movie, and everything about it.",1
"The acting here is wonderful. A lot of people give this movie a lot of crap, and all of it's really undeserved. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out.",1
I liked the plot of the movie. very well used plot line.,1
"The performances were quite good, especially Andrew McCarthy in a more mature roll. I enjoyed the film, and the fact that it aimed rather high in dealing with some sophisticated material. That's not how life works. I also enjoyed the look of the film which gave it a mysterious, forboding air.",1
This film was different.,1
"I was pleasantly surprised. The struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition. < br / > < br / > Personally, I enjoyed the film. < br / > < br / > I like suspense movies, and this one was no exception.",1
"The question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot, who changes? This film is certainly about the daughter, but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that Mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter. I am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also. More importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over Portman'portrayal of the daughter.",1
She is SMOKIN'hot and a great little actress to boot! The others are clearly not in her league. But you must see this just to watch Lisa Erickson as Julie.,1
"A man named Jerry comes into possession of an ancient Aztec doll. I liked this low - budget horror movie and you should too, if you are into 80'horror genre. 8 out of 10.",1
"She really hates that! He tells Stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his "" Aunt Martha "". He's been forced to skip town and move to a suburb in Miami. He's tragic, but also elegant. He could have really built his career on Martha.",1
"It took guts, nerve and guile to make this movie, which amazingly appears to have stood the test of time. Martha looks about as feminine as the sailors from SOUTH PACIFIC's supporting choir in their coconut bikini tops, yet somehow nobody seems to notice - - or care? Haha, what a great little movie!",1
"This film is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract. The working title was : "" Don't Spank Baby "".",1
"And trying to remember name "" Gracie, "" he tells Skipworth, "" Hmm. Oh, Gracie. """,1
"He's marvelously subtle and underplayed, and draws laughs from lines that in another actor's hands might not even have been heard. < br / > < br / > Charlie Ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as fussy banker "" Pinky "" Whinney.",1
"He is everyone's foil. / 10. Gracie's funny, quite, but she can also get tiring. Also, his comedy partner, Mary Boland plays his wife, Flora.",1
"The Studio finally agreed and began preparation of Fields'first solo starring feature, YOU'RE TELLING ME ( 1934 ). At times in the film she tends to go a bit over the top, but it's difficult to dislike her. Finally, he executes the near miraculous - he gets Gracie to shut up. Her heart was obviously made of solid gold. He felt he had now arrived at point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics. From beginning to end, they are a delight. They were a perfect team - she the strident lioness, he the nervous rabbit - and they dominate most of the screen time here. Three zany couples, all SIX OF A KIND, become entangled in a madcap search for stolen bank loot. Only Fields demurred.",1
"Being a freshman in college, this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mom. 8 / 10 It is very touching, I was moved by the movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > A real classic comedy from the thirties, not to missed. But back then we didn't delve into such things. They get Burns and Allen and a monster of a dog. All six of the featured players here are on the screen 99 % of the time, so they have to be good. To share expenses they advertise for someone to share the ride.",1
GO WEST with the Marx Brothers had Buster Keaton write the script as a gag man. < br / > < br / > But SIX OF A KIND is an example of six film comics who worked well together. Fields ( usually a single act ) was paired three times with Skipworth ( TILLY AND GUS and IF I HAD A MILLION were other two times ). As for Burns and Allan they manage to effortlessly involve themselves with the put upon Ruggles and Boland on their cross - country trip by car.,1
I'm surprised with the amount of negative reviews on this film. You won't be able to stop watching if you start.,1
"If you're in mood for comedy, Married To The Mob is a keeper. Hell, I still have the VHS of this film in good condition. He later falls in love with her after he realizes that she is innocent in all this.",1
"From there, despite 1980sness, it feels about right. The only problem with Married to the Mob is that it is not funny. Extremely glitzy.",1
"It's got some depth to it. It IS funny, but a lot of the humor is off - beat. < br / > < br / > Here's the trick - - - the film is not meant to be just a comedy. < br / > < br / > Matthew Modine is fun, but more important, he's a major hottie in this movie. Hot, cute and sexy.",1
But don't take it too seriously...,1
"A nice little flick, though not for every taste.",1
You'll be tickled by his screen time. But there are enough likable characters to sustain interest. < br / > < br / > Meesa Says : A good film to watch while folding laundry or eating leftovers.,1
"Once upon a time, long ago, Oscars were handed out to actresses for comedic roles such as this one.",1
Why does she work so infrequently? This is a damn funny and well - styled film. ( And I never trusted clowns anyway. ) Ouch!,1
"Dean Stockwell, in a sendup of John Gotti, is hysterical.",1
"The soundtrack is perfect. This is a fun movie with subtle intention. I know, I know, she was still young... ). Its off - beat comedy is hilarious to me, unfunny to my friends. Not so. I am so glad I bought the used VHS at a flea market. Jonathan Demme does a great job bringing to life the entire company and their respective roles.",1
"She does find her prince, but he's not that handsome. < br / > < br / > I wish IMDb linked to reviewers'other comments. Instead of a castle, at least initially, she gets a tiny walk - up in Manhattan.",1
There aren't any dead moments or cheap shots. I was wrong. And Matthew Modine? It's the ultimate judge. Why did I think back then that he didn't have any chemistry with Pfeiffer? Time does extraordinary things.,1
"You could tell it is an honest love story. This movie just felt very true to life. Well done. Namely "" the holidays. """,1
"Treading Water is a very beautiful movie. The actors, Angie Redman and Nina Landey are quite good.",1
7,1
Hilarious! Plus a great cameo by Little Richard. In all a fine and sadly misunderstood movie. I say to hell with everyone on this.,1
If all goes well we will get our ending!,1
Farscape totally rules!,1
"There have been other very successful shows that used multiple episode story arcs and complicated characters. This for me is one of the charms of the show. They have stated that the cancellation was based on sagging ratings. < br / > < br / > Unfortunately, the shortsighted people at the Sci - Fi channel have canceled Farscape's 5th season. Help save Farscape! Yet just few years ago it was their top rated original series and a critical favorite. < br / > < br / > Hey, don't take my word for it, watch the show, watch the re - runs and make up your own mind.",1
< br / > < br / > The acting is top notch from both of them. They seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes. You can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual movie. This film was a new direction for Natalie Portman.,1
"The next closest thing I can think of is Babylon 5 during the shadow wars episodes, but this tops even that. I am always itching for the next show. The overall plot is both original and thoroughly entertaining. The acting is also great, too many shows nowadays use only the American market of actors for their shows. Remember the first time you saw The Matrix and you said, wow where did that Agent Smith come from? This isci - fi. These Aussies are great and it comes through in this great show.",1
This incredible plotted and enjoyable TV - installment comes along as a positive birth - fantasy. The crew even has to go to the toilet. ).,1
I hope the rest of it is as good. I hope that they revive this show - with the same actors in either a movie or another series.,1
"Yes, even Buffy. There is also an extensive fan - based movement to bring the show back.",1
"The blue girl - Zahn - was cool, but not'sexy '. ? In fact, the exact OPPOSITE is true. It has NOTHING to do with the quality of the shows'slacking '. They kept getting better and better! Before it was sort of chaotic, slow, and rather aimless.",1
"Well, i got these episodes of Farscape "". < br / > < br / > I watched another 3 episodes thinking that 3 eps were not enough to decide i like or not since. ! < br / > < br / > I highly recommend it!! I have to tell you I've been a fan of Star Trek TNG since i was a kid.",1
"Okay, a few others have skirted the issue, but Farscape did it the best. This series is vastly underrated.",1
< br / > < br / > But Farscape is so much more then plain and simple Sci - Fi.,1
"Subsequent re - watches, however, have made numerous flaws apparent to me that I missed initially. "" I was immensely impressed and satisfied with "" Premiere "". Of course, there is Crichton, played well by Ben Browder. From here, the characters and story line for the Farscape series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed manner. When I first saw the Premiere Episode of Farscape, I had no idea what to expect. He's lost and has no idea how to do much of anything. In "" Premiere "", Crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the Peacekeepers.",1
"It's sexy. < br / > < br / > This series has it all. No really, she is. I can assure you, Sci / Fi as you know it, will change forever. It'Farscape Zotoh Zhan, who's a plant.",1
"< br / > < br / > I gave this one seven out ten. < br / > < br / > Could be better, could be worse. It pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure.",1
"I must admit, at first I was worried about Farscape.",1
"The visual aspects of the show are more than adequate, and well budgeted for a first season. These have also added some comedy to the show, something I would gladly see more of in "" serious "" sci - fi. There have been some science related topics explored as well as character secret / weakness revelations.",1
"I haven't heard dialogue this good since "" Blake's 7. "" < br / > < br / > Everyone, enjoy!",1
"Let me warn you, it is something that is absolutely irresistible to watch. < br / > < br / > As with any TV series, there are episodes that shine and those that don't. What I'm talking about is the growth of the main characters and their love for each other.",1
i happen to love this show. Its a refreshing take on some older sci - fi feels and styles.,1
Highly recommended viewing and well worth setting time aside to watch. Buy and enjoy! Maybe one day we can all enjoy a season five. 10 / 10.,1
"< br / > < br / > Roll on the second season! Gripping stuff. Ok, here goes!",1
The interplay between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is riveting. Real chemistry there.,1
Top marks. The characters are rounded and interesting. This is entertainment at its best.,1
And I have to mention Rygel - what a gloriously irreverent character! I first caught it - entirely by accident - whilst lounging in a hotel room.,1
"Wormhole theory, Time Travel in true equational form... Magnificent. They ran out of ideas pretty quickly + kept rehashing them!",1
It was the daring adventure of it all that stayed in my memory ever since. Where do I send my request?,1
"Life should be so simple and beautiful. I discount the 1980 version entirely as being fluff. This film, "" the blue lagoon "" had that effect on me. has it survived?",1
And again it was the young Jean Simmons.,1
Someone should bring it out on VHS and DVD. She certainly was beauty.,1
"< br / > < br / > This story was filmed in Great Britain, in 1923, just after the novel was written.",1
What a waste indeed! I remember coming home of an evening all full of wonder at what I had seen. I've spent a lifetime chasing the opportunity to get hold of it one day and nobody knows anything about it. I'm doing my best to make myself understood.,1
Therefore I WOULD recommend it for this reason alone. Anything that Dunne is in.,1
The police little to investigate the crime. A MUST SEE documentary. The camera goes with McGuinness to where Brenton was questioned.,1
She truly is one of the great character actresses of all time. ( Hester has been living there for a while. ) Who won the best actress Oscar for 1933? < br / > < br / > All the young cast are excellent. There is a very subtle suggestion in the film of Robert's sexuality.,1
< br / > < br / > Yet this reviewer finds Frances Dee's performance the best of all. Irene Dunn is stellar in her role.,1
I really felt the movie was ahead of its time. Her need to control her son's lives was neurotically evil.,1
"Then she finds out "" her "" room is down the hall from McCrea's, and his room adjoins mother's room. But mummy has a tight hold, faking illness and forever boasting of her sacrifices. Terrific acting by the 5 stars makes this one a must see. As boys run after her, mummy shouts from the window for boys to come back and get their coats! < br / > < br / > A neglected gem for anyone who But something seems wrong. Dunne is also excellent as she tries to maneuver the course without losing McCrea. Dee falls through the ice and is rescued.",1
Joel MaCrea is certainly in the same league as Cary Grant and Randolph Scott in the handsome and lovable stakes. It would have played like the VIRGINIA WOLF of 1932. Yikes! Some verbal barbs leveled at him again would not get past Code office if made later.,1
"The film drags on quite a bit, is ultimately predictable, at times far too melodramatic for sake of drama itself, but is genuinely powerful in the end. Ariana Richards'performance is of the daytime soap kind, but she is the strongest in the entire cast. Together, mother and daughter fight to put Kurt Ansom behind bars.",1
"I thoroughly recommend seeing movie. Ariana in particular put on an extremely emotional performance, with facial expressions to match.",1
"So, do see it if you get opportunity!",1
"There is also David Simonds ( Kurt the accountant from Amateur ) as a compulsive, homeless gambler. The final shot is spectacular. As usual, he creates a tone that is jaded and world - weary but at the same time, vulnerable, open, and honest.",1
But it happened & you will too.,1
If only there were a lot more movies made like this one! Could we all spend some time in Nanny's house?,1
"There is also David Simonds ( Kurt the accountant from Amateur ) as a compulsive, homeless gambler. The final shot is spectacular. As usual, he creates a tone that is jaded and world - weary but at the same time, vulnerable, open, and honest.",1
Definitely worthwhile ; clever and funny without overdoing it.,1
The interaction of Jesus and Satan provides some hilarious scenes...,1
Hilarious film about divine retribution.,1
"< br / > < br / > This movie is actually part of the French "" 2000 As Seen By. "" But overlook this flaw, and you'll be treated to a fine film.",1
One of my favorite Hartley movies.,1
"After all, we're already paying attention to the actors, and the writing is alive. It was as if Cheney had gotten the whole idea from Hal. < br / > < br / > If you like Hartley films of course, you'll like it. Or three.",1
"For Brenton Butler the consequences of this system could be devastating. But do they get it? This is an extraordinary film. Every citizen has a right to justice, whether a perpetrator or a victim. The film is well paced, understate and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.",1
"Donovan is well cast as Jesus, lending a benevolent mien and One of the many speculations about Y2K was that the world was going to end at the stroke of midnight on December 31, 1999. Do they deserve what must befall them? The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is intriguing and stimulating, as is the effect of their presence upon those they encounter during their corporeal stay in the city.",1
Hartley gives him excellent dialogue and a chance to use his resounding voice to full effect. Martin Donovan is astonishing as Jesus.,1
"I wish would come out on DVD. The kids seem to enjoy it, although, they wish it were in color. I was surprised at how "" up to date "" the story line is. Although, references to "" reform school "" are outdated.",1
"< br / > < br / > Sad to say, there aren't that many young - people's orchestras today - a sad mistake. The fee he received in that era was unheard of. Can you believe that Walter Brennan ( "" Prof. Lawson "" ) of all those western movies was the man running the school?",1
": - ) ). < br / > < br / > All in all, great movie for everyone! I really enjoyed this movie, and I'm not a classical music fan. The owner of the school didn't think it was important to notify the police about finding a missing boy, but let him live in the basement indefinitely? Bathe?",1
"It is the listener who should be moved, not the artist. These are juvenile complaints which reflect a limited historical perspective. If you want blatant emotional posturing, go to a rock concert. In was still an era not totally overwhelmed by the lowest common denominator tripe we get today. < br / > < br / > As for Heifetz being wooden, I could not disagree more. Color can, in fact, get in the way of a good storyline, or the music.",1
!,1
"She had a nice soprano even as a child. First the film is a homage to Jascha Heifetz, considered to be the best violin virtuoso of the past century. < br / > < br / > But it's Heifetz you see the show for. I think Samuel Goldwyn was trying to accomplish two things in this film.",1
"< br / > < br / > What is not surprising is how good the acting is. For many years, Samuel Goldwin tried to bring his friend Jascha Heifetz to the screen. And the movie, originally titled "" Music School "" was born.",1
Art imitates life imitates art.,1
Joel McCrea and Andrea Leeds were ideal fits for their parts. He convinces a famous violinist to sponsor the school. < br / > < br / > The acting is a study in contrasts.,1
"David Lynch shot his first film,'Erasurehead ', over several years, adding new scenes each time he managed to raise a little bit more cash. Such a figure is Mark Borchardt, the subject of this hilarious documentary which chronicles his attempt to make a pair of movies over many many years. But $ 30, 000 is still a hell of a lot of money to raise if you work as a cleaner in a cemetery. And like a modern day Ed Wood, he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of fellow losers, his genuine affection for whom is his greatest redeeming feature.",1
< br / > < br / > Such is producer Smith's skill that Mark appears more sympathetic than otherwise. The humor comes from Borchardt's Ed Wood - style belief in his own genius. He is so confident he can't fail that failure is guaranteed.,1
"Jesus told me so!!! "" To tell a story, ( no matter how simple and unrealistic ). Chicago Rules. Rugged Individualism materializes in every art form. Man, these people are hilarious. Let's face it, lot's of bad movies are made all the time. It's okay!... None of them serve as models of the filmmakers we know and have worked with. American Movie captures the raw spirit of independent film - making.",1
"I highly recommend this fine film, worth sitting through any hellish screening.",1
Go to see this - - you'll end up wishing it was longer.,1
"< br / > < br / > I haven't seen a documentary this honest since the movie on R. Crumb. The supporting "" cast "" ( Mark's real - life family and friends ) are all great.",1
"Let everyone now start talking about "" Southern justice. "" < br / > < br / > The police made absolutely no effort - and they admitted it! He must havehrunk, reversed his age by 5 - 10 years and changed clothes.",1
"Who knows? < br / > < br / > That's where I learned about "" American Movie. """,1
I rented this movie for two reasons. He once gave me a table that he made.,1
This may actually the finest film of 1999. < br / > < br / > The film is about maverick artists and their passions. < br / > < br / > And what a great subject he chooses. No I'm not kidding.,1
"But then, miraculously, I got married, and had kids. I enjoyed this one, because I can relate to it. For this reason, there is a hopelessness about him. And man, what odds there are! < br / > < br / > Mark hasn't faced up to that reality as yet, and so, in that sense, he is a retarded adolescent. Yet he trudges on, much like Ed Wood, apparently without any semblance of a clue. That is what an mature, responsible adult does. I realized that being a struggling filmmaker was, in all likelihood, not going to feed my family. Mark has kids and an ex - wife and bills to pay, but the film depicts him caring basically only about pursuing his "" artistic vision "".",1
"What gives this movie its personality is the knowledge, in the end, that it is all true. < br / > < br / > B + ), it does seem to get a bit long towards the end.",1
"There's a scene where an actor has to have his head break a cupboard, and it's just not working. A lot of humor sadly comes from Mark himself. Is he aware of this? He talks incessantly about leaving some kind of mark on the world, and he sees filmmaking as a way to do this. This is a very very funny documentary.",1
I absolutely loved American Movie. In Mark we discover a young man filled with contrast.,1
You just found it.,1
I must have had it on for an entire day.,1
It is a great film. But he'also a charismatic guy.,1
Walking the night is scary business. Very good film. They need to be drowned. < br / > < br / > I'm just in shock.,1
To call this film depressing would be something of an understatement. High recommended.,1
"The main characters name is Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick. All he has on him is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. This makes Tamura think and even more scared than he already is. There, he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of Japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church. But since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed, he begins a long walk. Comparing this movie to other World War 2 movies, it is not typical at all. This is typical for He does not hit him.",1
"Its a jarring sensation. This isn't to say its not horrifying, it is at times, but its also darkly comic. This is a bleak tale of the destruction of the Japanese soldier. How could it not be? Its a bleak journey with no hope in sight and only death and man's inhumanity to man at every turn.",1
"But at his best, he was as good as any Japanese film maker at the time. The soldiers are defeated and starving to death. This is that rare film - one which will refuse to erase itself from your head, even if you want to forget it. No really, its seriously hell.",1
Ichikawa died February 2008.,1
"this small affair of humans will end soon, earth seems to be saying, but I will survive and barely notice it. He doesn't manage to do very well on any account, slowly starving and eventually committing some fairly repellent acts. < br / > < br / > The Phillipines, 1945, and the situation really does seem hopeless, for PFC Tamura and everyone else. < br / > < br / > Ichikawa's film is as brutal, uncompromising and intense as any war film I've seen.",1
"Two of the populous comes back to get some supplies, and Tamura sneaks up on them. It's a film about the men in this war, or perhaps more universally in wars in general, who lose their humanity. It makes Stone's Platoon look like a picnic : at least they had certain things, like food, after all. < br / > < br / > In film Tamura just wants to get some medical care. It's an ex Tamura's path in Fires on the Plain is told in vignettes, little stories like when he comes upon a seemingly deserted enemy village. Kon Ichikawa had lived through world war two, and saw what its effects it had on his people in Japan.",1
"See it if you can get it. If I had to compile a list of ten greatest war films, this film would be on it.",1
"Fires on The Plain ( 1959 ) * * * * < br / > < br / > You don't see films like this anymore. 'Fires on the Plain'is an incredible depiction of the lives of the soldiers of the Japanese Imperial Army. He takes the boots, replacing them with his old ones.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film'opening, with the two - way discussion between the two Japanese soldiers, prefigures and reechoes the events. Like Germania Anno Zero, by Roberto Rossellini, a story emerges from the environment and the conditions associated with it. Though good films may have the ability of universalizing their subjects, which is often a hard thing to do ; great films have the ability of universalizing their unipolar subjects, which is what this film does.",1
"War is horrifying, bloody, destructive. Ichikawa, reveals what the Germans called the "" war life, "" the plight of the common soldier. However, what is fundamental about "" Fires on the Plain "" is its unapologetic look at the Japanese soldiers. My only regret is that I was not able to see this 1959 film sooner.",1
"The characters defy moral judgment because they are creatures beset by a great woe, a woe that does not permit questions of a moral nature. It is in that shabby excuse of a hospital that one of the most harrowing scenes of the film takes place. War and survival. Nobi cuts deep, it's ugly, tenebrous and bleak as few things ever committed on celluloid will ever be. Which it does. The loser is simply removed from existence.",1
"They euphemistically refer to human flesh as "" monkey meat. "" We like to think that every Japanese man was ready and able to fight to the death, right up to the day we bombed Nagasaki. "" Every American who thinks he or she understands World War Two should see this movie.",1
"By the way, I had attended a Kon Ichikawa retrospective at London's National Film Theatre in September 2002, but only managed to catch some of his work made between 1960 and 1973. Surely one of the film's major assets is the stunning cinematography of the unforgiving and desolate muddy landscape.",1
"This is one of the most anti - traditional war movies about was I have seen. The story concerns the Japanese who are stranded in the Phillipines after the US returned in late 1944 - early 1945. Horrible but great. Plus, there is a case in the movie where a soldier DOES try to surrender but is gunned down. You simply couldn't have made a better film of this type.",1
"It follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another, and eventually to death.",1
The atmosphere is very melancholic. Fans had changed their mind after that and were waiting for it on DVD.,1
And there's mildly surprising epilogue. The camera work is pretty solid.,1
This is a tale. I LOVE this film!!!!,1
"While watching Giorgino don't try to look for some hidden symbols ( though there are some ), better look for thoughts expressed through characters and their behavior, and do learn from them.",1
That's certainly not the best film ever. But that's certainly worth seeing for people with a special kind of mind.,1
"Giorgino is a long, excruciating journey from bad to worse in the life of protagonist after whom the movie is named.",1
That's a shame.,1
! Bravo for little guy!! < br / > < br / > Bravo for justice!!!,1
"I was delighted to find that the story brought more than I expected. Yet, all of the supporting actors fit well with his character.",1
I found this film rather brilliant. in their boat. it added to the fear factor.,1
Grace Pat & Adam end up stranded on a tree in the swamp with Pat hanging on for dear life on the capsized boat. You wonder right from the start who in the end would survive the crocodile attacks and eventually live to tell about them. The ending with the crocodile vrs human confrontation was about the weakest and most unrealistic part in the film.,1
< br / > < br / > Watch this movie and you will not disappointed.,1
"Also again I just don't think some of the characters actions were realistic. The plot is actually somewhat original, and will definitely keep you intrigued with it. Black Water "" is a movie that in a way surprised me, and definitely exceeded my original expectations. "" It really wasn't. And sure it's not perfect, but that doesn't mean it's not worth a shot.",1
"i liked the action, suspense.",1
I give it a 7. First - rate film - making.,1
This is as much a crocodile film as OPEN WATER was a shark film. Go and watch this very beautifully shot and acted suspenseful film.,1
You rock!,1
"Like most, I thought'another crocodile movie '.",1
That is true faith. Back to the movie. old and was raised to be a bigot. She is 81 yrs. Scary.,1
"That happened to the first 3 victims but not to Lee. Croc's will spin around and around to dismember and drown the prey. She ends up with her hand in his ( her? ) The basic plot of this film has already been detailed in several other comments so I won't bother. This is essentially art for art's sake. Based upon what I have seen, croc's attack and continue to hold on until the prey stops struggling.",1
"This was an impressive achievement. Added to this there was some fine camera work and the directors pulled it all together admirably. I put this movie on not expecting much, other than a B movie gore fest.",1
"Just a croc and a piece of meat. < br / > < br / > All in all, this one'a winner. < br / > < br / > There is no question that this film gets off to a slow start. Have fun, fellas! No CGI, no animatronics, no miniatures. How much more realistic can you get?",1
One of the best horror / suspense movies I have seen in a long time. < br / > < br / > I had tears in my eyes at the end. Very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it.,1
< br / > < br / > Love it!,1
We laughed in ROGUE more than anything.,1
The whole movie is about their survival while the crocodile is lurking below waiting to strike.,1
She may prove to be quite discovery. It not about the characters so much as about the human condition. Never mind what the actors would do... what would YOU do in their situation?,1
"), their boat is capsized and the guide killed by an alligator so our luckless adventurers take refuge up a tree.",1
No. This little nail bitter has very little blood and guts. Gore hounds beware... this is not your movie. For hours and hours he swam around tree and shook the dead body still in his mouth at the friends in the tree.,1
"I just saw the movie, through Netflix. The cop told him, to go on, keep sucking on that cancer stick.",1
"This is what drives the film's chaotic adrenaline, and in which it lasts ( even when its kept buried ) through to the very end. Sound FX is the key, and at times the lack of any just eats away at you. Smiling would be the last thing on my mind. The way the night sequence is executed is immensely chilling and pulsating. What we get is a patient survival tale than just a bloody, all - out creature feature onslaught. Sure some moments felt unlikely, but never does it get in the way or distract. In certain patches the notch goes up, with pressure induced suspense and startling images.",1
High recommended. This low budget crocodile movie really delivers the goods.,1
Apparently based on true events.,1
"My vote is seven. However, in the muddy water, their boat is flipped and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water.",1
"Well, I put it in, and almost immediately I was sucked right in. You can not tell me that doesn't freak you out just a little. This is a very appealing movie. The story is about a boat ride down a river in Australia.",1
The situation they were in was quite terrifying and I really felt nervous for them. While many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic I really connected with it.,1
"I try to see a mixture of classics, mainstream, art - house, and other movies. They crammed in Star Wars and Jaws in the last few minutes, when they were two of the most important. It's a very professional, polished documentary, and it's even financed by IFC films. It became like nothing anyone had ever seen before.",1
"com. So materialistic! A Decade Under the Influence "" documents the precise moment at which that change took place. After the seventies, the FBI agents were all incompetent and the best a cop could aspire to was to ignore their foolishness and his superior's corruption and uphold justice in his own idiosyncratic manner.",1
"Or, as Peter Fonda observed in Easy Rider, "" We blew it. "" Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Former Warner Bros.'head John Calley recalls that when he first saw Robert De Niro in Mean Streets he assumed Scorsese had secured a psychopath's day release for the shoot.",1
Fascinating stuff. 7 out of 10.,1
"I will watch it again and again. "" Lackawanna Blues'is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban Blacks during the 50s and early 60s.",1
"'It was - traumatic,'one guy says. The footage of an audience coming out of a daytime screening of the Exorcist was priceless.",1
A surprisingly good documentary. and the film clips well considered.,1
"The way the clips and directors / actors pop up, edited together in a flashy and quick style, is also fascinating.",1
The decade was marked by the end of the Viet Nam war and the turbulent finale of those years of Jimmy Carter's presidency. < br / > < br / > This documentary is must see for all movie fans.,1
"Working long hours with short pay. Sometime with a clutch of extras. Especially Julie Christie and Dennis Hopper. Or go straight to HBO and rental. Perhaps not. The 1970s opened the door to the largest, most diverse era of film in the history. Shooting a film in under a month.",1
"< br / > < br / > There are also many fine excerpts from Al Pacino's break - through film "" The The film is rich with interviews and opinions of filmmakers. Unfortunately the documentary logging in at 138 minutes is too short! This summarizes the other areas of this period of film - making in American history.",1
"Larry Nehring IS George Washington, and he is perfect for that part. The narrative to the camera, also work fantastic.",1
< br / > < br / > Grahame Greene is magnificent as the presenter. < br / > < br / > BRAV! ! Kudos to the producers of this epic!!!,1
Visceral yet low - budget action sequences are interspersed throughout. THE STUDENT NURSES is not a typical sexploitation movie.,1
"A real sleeper. Moreover, four attractive and appealing female leads all turn in sound and praiseworthy work.",1
What an incredible piece of work.,1
* High * recommended.,1
John Leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller.,1
John is REAL talent.,1

At least in Freak he does. But his stuff in Freak showcases his genius and when he's in the spotlight he's without peer.,1
"The tableaux keep moving at a steady paste, so the film never gets tedious. As you can see, I haven't revealed the ending. A proper viewing for Christmas or Lent.",1
"If only child birth were that easy!!!! It helps to appreciate the crudeness of early cinema. Again, where others might be bothered by the cudeness of them, I was quite charmed.

"But after watching this program, I surely wish I had. Could we possibly take such a theory that leads to such consequences seriously? However, if we are to describe the universe in terms of string theory, there is a very big price to pay. How can we unify all these forces that we know together?",1
"It was very understandable to anyone who is just being introduced to this subject. My local PBS station WHYY Philadelphia recently showed "" The Elegant Universe. """,1
The Elegant Universe brings to light many ideas of the universe and existence.,1
"The killer was scary in his own demented way and the end is very unexpected. I cannot believe someone gave this movie a 1 rating!! ! The story is fresh, there is some nudity, and it is very campy.",1
"It just does not jump up and grab one, hard enough. < br / > < br / > But it does get going and has it's moments of originality. Bit of a curate's egg, this one.",1
"A solid and satisfying shocker. David San Jose's moody score likewise does the trick. Terrific whammy of surprise dark ending, too.",1
Your enjoyment of this film may ultimately come down to your acceptance of the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot. Moments in time relived and a killer who continues his work seemingly from the grave.,1

"Deja vu ""? Congra! The plot is simple but efficient.",1
"There are scenes in this film that take comedy to a new level. However, there is a fine line between plain awful and absolutely hilarious and believe me this film is the latter.

Welker makes the film. Knotts and Welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty. This may have been Knotts'last good outing.,1
"Knotts is an accountant for a Podunk city hall that is good for swindling the citizens. Such actors as Frank Welker, and Pitt Herbert add to the mayhem. Fun for anyone, especially nostalgia buffs, but just about anyone will love it.",1

We are given little information as to how this date was calculated. I have systematically attempted to view each of the films that I have missed. It questions the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise. The clips, especially those from the 1950's, seemed a tad unnecessary to me.",1
The End Of Suburbia ( TEOS ) is a very useful film. It's also important and provocative.,1
"The ambivalence lies particularly in each respective viewers critical analysis of the film. It's a bleak outlook on our inherent way of life. This is bound to happen. This is the prescription that is laid out for suburbia, and the film focus's on the singular idea of "" Oil "".",1

It gave the viewer a sense of a mechanically lived life. There was a lot about Little Vera that was strange to me.,1
< br / > < br / > Little Vera is shocking and disturbing in nearly every way. It is the implosion of a family set against the implosion of an entire social order.,1
"Tensions escalate until Vera'father drunkenly stabs Sergei. Most interesting, however, was public reception. While many wrote hate mail to the director and star, the film was wildly popular. < br / > < br / > Unbearable in almost every imaginable way, Little Vera masterfully captures and communicates the inescapable void left in social life after the collapse of communism.",1
"< br / > < br / > Forget your stereotyped, cold Russians of spy movies. And her prospects for the future are not much better.",1
"This relationship leads the family to a tragedy. Sergei moves to Vera's house, but lives in conflict with her father. The cast has great performances and the actress Natalya Negoda is very beautiful.",1
"Really good. The opening scene shows the bleak industrial town of Zhdanov, nearly a hell on earth. And as the movie shows, there's not much faith to be had in it. For example, there's Viktor ( remember that "" victor "" means winner ).",1
"It is difficult, today and in the US, to understand this movie. Then suddenly this. One says it was groundbreaking because it contained real sex. It needs to be viewed that way or you will not understand the film. People were stunned. This was life in the Soviet Union for most people. Then the film was exhibited freely in Iraq. They simply don't compare.",1
"Is this how the Muppets really started? "" Steve Martin's amusing bit as a rude waiter is probably best.",1
I am very glad I didn't. I gave this film my rare 10 stars.,1
I recommend this DVD to any C & T fan. I would guess about half the shows broadcast are included. The Captain and Tennille have released a very good 3 DVD package with minimal editing. Hopefully those issues can be resolved and a Volume 2 can be released sometime in the future.,1

"Although it may not be Cassavetes'best work, Minnie and Moskowitz is almost perfect in all its endeavours. In this case it's inconsistent. I gained an affection for this film that I lacked on first viewing. This philosophising - - a tradition in Cassavetes'films - - is what made the film for me. I find the plot to be unbalanced. But one or two scenes, unfortunately, just don't work. I assess that most of this film was improvised, and most of it beautifully.",1
that's a kind of hero. sad love. mad love. true love. real love. i want to be that kind of man.,1
"Moskowitz nearly drives us mad, let alone Minnie. Our egos play Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, delivering startlingly pitiable people, are hardly likable. Minnie and Moskowitz is the most pathetic and ungraceful love story I've ever seen.",1

"Why, its a experimental unit inside a maximum security prison.",1
"They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm forget romance... OZ doesn't mess around. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid.",1
"Being that Oz is mostly black, the Homeboys have the most soldiers of any gang inside. < br / > < br / > There are about 10 gangs shown on Oz. The Sicilians pretty much have the most substantial say in how any illegal activity gets conducted in Oz. As a group they are not so much anti - white but rather anti - injustice. In this group, one character who is acted terrifically is Simon Adebisi.",1
He Oz is the TV show which is intensive non - stop adrenaline. These two reasons are why he is one of the most powerful inmates inside of Oz. There are many different ethnic groups which play a somewhat equal role in being represented. Hes also very physically quite large and solid.,1
"This show is easily one of best shows on television. Don't be a fool, go watch Oz. This show has everything you could ever want from a prison drama. There are twists and turns all the way till the season finally.",1
What a great show! I think the best character on the show is Vern Schillinger.,1
"However, the character that MADE Oz OZ was CHRIS KELLER ( played by Christopher Meloni ). * Karl Metzger ( guard ) gets killed and no one investigates. The transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is amazing. * Drugs getting in oz * Everyone in the rehab group used or sold drugs and sister Pete never helped anyone in six years.",1
"And most of all... the don't have no remorse for their actions. Overall... Oz is amazing show, the best one out there. Why?",1
"In short, precise strokes, we are introduced to the major players as well as some of the minors. And if there ever was a moment in which he demonstrated this, Labyrinth aside, it is 1979's Muppet Movie. Hence, everyone had a favourite. A great light in the world went out the day Jim Henson died. These were not just a bunch of felt puppets with singular personalities who combined to put on a show. When Animal appeared behind a drum kit and attempted to eat a cymbal, I knew I had found one of mine.",1
Brilliant show which has the balls to show what other shows are taking away from us ; realism. I admit that I almost gave up on watching TV shows. Why?,1
< br / > < br / > Oz have an amazing plot and an outstanding cast! OZ is an old TV series released by HBO.,1
This show just literally blew my socks off...,1
< br / > < br / > * * WARNING SPOILERS INSIDE THIS REVIEW! But still a golden glove. And now i just seen the episode 3 of season 6. It is a really good series!,1
"I do recommend it. If there is anything I will always remember about this show it's them. Thats why, when the ends come for them as well, it almost hurt to much. I love seasons 2 - 4. This is a hard show to watch. Oz is a brave show. People get screwed over, raped, tortured and die like flies.",1
There's plenty of racist comments flying in here but it's for all races. < br / > < br / > I give it a 10. Guess I gotta sell it all online.,1

There was the hardcore stuff of course - some plain evil but essentially Oz had soul. < br / > < br / > I first caught Oz towards the end of the first series and from then on It was an unmissable watch.,1
"the best word to describe it is "" genius ""! Oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time!",1
The acting by the entire cast was excellent.,1
"Sure it'gratuitous language, but that is REALISTIC. Prison life isn't PG - 13. < br / > < br / > Guess what?",1
( Steve Martin's has to be the best one. ),1
"This is as good as gets. It was a brave, risky first entry and with it HBO hit a grand slam with it. It is a show that no matter how brutal it is get through, one cannot take its eyes off of.",1
i wish it would come back for one more season. Sopranoes sucks huge compared to OZ.,1
Prime Suspect is Tom and Jerry vs The Simpsons. But why all the male nudity? No contest.,1
"Every interaction has some machination working in the background. Oz is a great series, one of televisions underrated shows.",1
"It tells the story of confrontation, cruelty, violence, hate and survival at any cost. Oz is set in Oswald State Correctional Facility. This show may seem shocking at first but to truly tell it like it is, such a thing is necessary.",1
"He is an amazing actor. The case was seemingly airtight against Ray, the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys. Without "" Cassie's "" personal history about the ex - husband that nearly killed her, who, not surprisingly, shared similar traits with Richard Hayward, she never would have pursued her instincts about Justin and Richard. Enter Sandra Bullock's character, who it seems most people didn't particularly appreciate. I didn't see that as the case here.",1
< br / > < br / > The story is told in a nice way. We all know this crime will not turn out perfect. I liked this movie. You also get to know the two detectives hunting them. The scenes between them are the better scenes in the movie. You are starting to get to know the people involved. The killers are two high school kids.,1
That'what I intend to do! Thank you Jim Henson. I can still sing along to my heart's desire.,1
"However, all arelievable. I enjoyed this movie very much.",1

imdb. < br / > < br / > Like I said : reasonably entertaining and watchable. There are no shortcuts there. The two creepy troubled kids are portrayed adequately by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. Just don't use this as required viewing for detective exams. '.,1
Just to play and jostle with the cops? Loved the acting of all but Sam. So the first crime they commit is murder? She sure made me believe she was one angry cop. This whole concept is really hard to believe. He had no get - up and go. Hmmm.,1
!,1
"Naturally, Cassie will stop at nothing to find the murderers. That said, the cast is great. Assigned to help her is fellow officer, Sam ( Ben Chaplin ).",1
"Enter Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case. They play their characters convincingly and with just the right amount of malice. It'still an entertaining movie, nonetheless. But, I digress. But Sandra has a feeling that all is not as it appears to be. The boys have planted evidence, created alibis, and cleaned up after themselves so well that the cops fall for the whole act.",1
"Then a bunch of false leads are planted that point to an innocent bystander. All others are pretty flat. I gathered from the ads that it was a thriller. Two teens decide to commit a perfect murder. It'll cost you eight bucks to find out. ( IMDB says that she's FBI, but I don't remember that.",1
"Otherwise, there are just too many of these murder plot themes.",1
And that is what this movie is about.,1
What the film does instead is concentrate on the purposes of their killings and if they have what it takes to commit the perfect murder. Cassie Mayweather. Sandra Bullock plays the heroic thorn in the way of their plans as Det.,1
"There are interesting turns in "" Numbers "". Bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character. The movie is not so much a thriller, but rather a character study of Cassie. < br / > < br / > There are many entertaining twists and turns throughout the movie. Everything is done very competently. Though Chaplin does the bewilderment thing very admirably. However, it is just not inspired work. Sandra Bullock and Barbet Schroeder deserve a lot better, and so do we.",1

Take it to bed. ).,1
"I also liked the style of animation used - and the theme of the episode. < br / > < br / > Available YouTube. Porky is a nice edition to the episode, though it was not vital for him to be there. The way Daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing, yet highly amusing at the same time. I liked this short quite a lot ( despite the other reviewers on here ).",1
Instead I was flooded with childhood memories of watching this short.,1
"All sense of subtlety, so effectively conveyed hitherto, is lost, as the implicit point is heavily and noisily made. Miles and Shaw are wonderfully subtle, and we see more in their'less'; never once are these actorly, showy performances. Agit - prop surely has no place in this sort of delicate period drama. < br / > < br / The political point is heavily over - egged by this bombastic, rather dingily operatic ending. Your distance from ever fully sympathizing with any one true character mirrors the dormant'difference'that so dooms the central relationship. They are fittingly Stanislavskian interpretations that create the impression of these characters having life outsides the confines of the film.",1
"This is a superb performance by Robert Shaw. What? "" It's not a war film! "" She is lost and lonely.",1

She practically grimaced every time they were together. fly home to their Midwest town and try to resume, or create, civilian lives. As I said, it was fashionable.

"Wyler's direction, especially of the scene where Andrews The clever plot line was the experiences of thee "" couples "" after the soldiers ( three being spotlighted ) tried to return home to a'victory culture "". So many great talents were utilized in "" The Best Years of Out Lives "", the result has to be somewhat miraculous.",1
"Also later in the film we find out that their marriage has not always been a bed of roses. But the talent of both these men was focused on achieving a perfectly crafted movie, understood in the good old American sense as a great story. < br / > < br / > Wyler is a director whose force lies in being true to his work without feeling the need to boast. With a perfect cast and great dialogue Goldwin and Wyler produced a movie that will forever be the template for any other returning home movie.",1
"Very well done. The Best Years of Our Lives "" was probably the best example.",1

And they paid mine as well. Each had problems directly related to the war. She had seen a great deal of action. What a statistic we have to live with. ) I oppose all war. It is hard to know what value individual life may have. They never should be.,1

"Despite its near three - hour length, it does not drag for a minute. The script by Sherwood features very human characters and great dialog. WWII veterans return home and find it hard to adjust to civilian life.",1
The theme of human desires is timeless. I disagree. A must see movie for any true movie fan. The cast was uniformly wonderful.,1
"Thanks to TCM On Demand, I was able to watch it uncut and commercial free. < br / > < br / > We have the Air Force officer, who was a veteran of the early European bombing campaign.

"No wonder, it certainly must have deserved. This movie is a masterpiece. Seven Academy Awards? Sometimes, but very rarely, a movie tells a story so well that it almost becomes difficult.",1
Polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile facade with a longevity of ice cubes in boiling water!! ! America is on top right!! Theresa Wright has become painfully aware of the fact that she is constructively selfish!!,1
"< br / > < br / > At almost three hours of length, film never seems long and drawn out. Not a performance rings false, though the standouts are those of Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry.",1

They all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them, Boone City, Iowa. < br / > < br / > Harold Russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the Pacific.",1
I would recommend this excellent film to anyone who loves movies.,1
"Three men return home from war and try to return to civilian life with great difficulty. I watch this movie every time it plays on TV. It's the scenes just off camera and the unspoken dialog which resonates the most loudly, however. A simply brilliant film.",1

Old things become new and new things die.,1

"Nevertheless, it is a remarkable piece of cinema which is as timeless as a rare work of art. < br / > < br / > Mon Oncle Antoine is - in every sense of the word - unforgettable. It will leave lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived in - or visited - Québec. Go watch action / adventure / romance / comedies to be amused. A coming of age story, yes, but far more than simple memoirs of adolescence in 1940's Québec. A classic.",1
"A poor box - office performer when released, this film has been largely forgotten today. I've seen Jimmy Stewart in all the regular roles, but the "" Spirit of St. Louis "" was reported to be one of his favorites. Lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the U. S., and Stewart seems determined to keep up appearances.",1
One of Stewarts finest roles and this film can deliver time after time. It well edited with flashbacks over Lindeberghs life.,1
Billy Wilder created a somewhat conventional biopic about the Charles Lindberg flight. to make an enjoyable film that has aged better than most films from that time.,1
"< br / > < br / > This is the best movie with Muppets by a long shot. I saw it at the drive - ins here in California in the late 70s. Of course. I'm sure this was meant to relate to some of Jim Henson's own personal or spiritual experiences. If I rate the film maybe a bit high, you can blame it on sentiment.",1
"So how can there be any suspense or intrigue in this film? Well, there is.",1
"And the look of the plane itself was great. Stewart's age didn't bother me at all in this movie, although he was portraying a much younger person.",1
No student of film history should miss seeing this one.,1
"He IS a pilot BEING a pilot, that's enough. What is it below? Yet, I can only just its impact on me.",1
Very good! It was nominated the Oscar for Best Special Effects ( the only award it was ever nominated ).,1
"< br / > < br / > But never mind that. Some of today's viewers will find some incidents corny if they think too much about them. That landing at Le What's the alternative. St. Louis, Missouri, is the home of the partnership that sponsored the flight. It's an impressive film. ( Even in 1927, money talked. ) Observing the unities? And he can't sleep. Anyway, the movie HAD to have multiple flashbacks and Stewart's narration. The atheist Stewart is saved twice - - once by a fly and once by God.",1
The story is well told and the performances are also good though not outstanding.,1
"And his next two were "" Some Like it Hot "" and "" The Apartment. "" What run!",1
"< br / > < br / > In what at times threatens to become a monotonous film, Wilder keeps it ticking over by using flashbacks to Lindbergh's life. 7 / 10 This is the story of that flight "".",1
"For those of us who actually fly, flight can be hours of boredom punctuated by moments of terror. < br / > < br / > This movie is not for everybody but it certainly is for me. I hope they make it on DVD soon so I can replace my stolen version! This is a great story. I wouldn't have wanted to see the flight shortened at all. < br / > < br / > Some have commented about too many flashbacks but I don't know a better way to keep a long flight interesting. The oppressive need for sleep and the drone and surrounding loneliness is part of the story. ).",1
"It certainly isn't his nor Stewart's best work, but it is a gem of a movie. Overall, it is just plain good.",1
< br / > < br / > See it. You won't be disappointed.,1
This is classic movie that should be viewed by all. I appreciate the fact that they didn't throw in a lot of fluff and just let the story tell itself. And he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before - - which is amazing!! Well done throughout.,1
"Even the typically muted and problematic WarnerColor adds to the film rather than detracts from it. Maybe because they thought they knew the story or that it was just going to be one guy stuck in a cockpit for two hours. Once the film is airborne, it's both surprising and suspenseful, finding genuine drama in his attempts to stay awake and to navigate without proper instruments. In 1982 it was Blade Runner.",1
"The story is an interesting one and for Stewards'fans compelling to say the least. In 1927, it was believed no man could fly the breath of the Atlantic Ocean. * * * * Such then is the heart of this movie called "" The Spirit of St. Louis. "" Many had tried but failed and some even gave their lives to the effort.",1

"Their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable, but with a anti - climax and let down to end it. This is a match i'd recommend watching. Typical Undertaker fare. It can hardly be regarded as classic wrestling match. < br / > < br / > Shawn Michaels and Edge open up for Raw. It has its usual highs and lows, and i loved the ending, in particular the Vince McMahon entrance. Watch if you're a fan. Raw's match is a pretty dull and boring affair, which is a pity as i'm a fan of both guys involved. Its also a casket match. It's hard to sum up without giving away the winner. < br / > < br / > The next two matches are the title matches. Two from Smackdown and two from Raw.",1

"That's how I'd sum it up! The main actor here ( who is as I've been told very popular in his homeland France ), is perfect in his role here. He's the spy with number 117 attached to him.",1
5 and recommend.,1
"The true comedy of the film is in its blatant disregard for political correctness. I just saw this film last night, and I have to say that I loved every minute. All in all, I thought this film excellent. If taken in the spirit of a parody of Bond - esquire films, it's truly superior.",1
"The man behind "" la classe américaine "" comes back with a really fun and clever sequel to those old - fashioned OSS - 117... Seems like M. Hazanavicius is back! It all starts in 1955 with a British spy disappearing while tracking a Russian cargo full of weapons in Suez. He just looks like an unfrozen Lino Ventura, with something like 40 pounds less, which is perfect for the role.",1
"Surprisingly, it's neither. The women and the music are beautiful. Just saw the movie, it's actually pretty good.",1
"The Muppet's are very, very funny. I can't wait to see it. I have always loved The Muppets. So Kermit takes off for Hollywood. I mean they are all very funny.",1
This is probably one of the best French movies I had seen in a very long time! Some references to today's world are very subtle. Wait and see. I just hope this movie is released on DVD in the US...,1
< br / > < br / > Definite worth seeing. Wonder how it will be appreciated in US?,1
Jupiter sends down a hungry stork this time whose frog lusty eyes devour the town's residents. This film features a few beautiful crowd scenes of dozens of puppet frogs.,1
"So, to teach them a nasty lesson, he makes an Egret the king and one by one it starts eating its subjects! They appeal to their god, Jupiter, to give them a king.",1
That alone should tell you what to expect here! Jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork.,1
"Irritated, Jupiter sends them a stork. - - was a dark political satire variously known as "" Frogland "" or "" The Frogs Who Wanted a King. "" < br / > < br / > The political tumult of the Russian Revolution caused Starewicz to move to Paris, where one of his first productions - - coincidentally?",1
"However, in the end, he cannot abide by his selfish decision. THE ASCENT is a very worthwhile addition to recent re - releases from the Soviet Union.",1
The moral ramifications are staggering. I can truthfully say that it was horrifying. Be it mental or physical. I missed the beginning of the film.,1
"Their allegorical performances, under Shepitko's sharp direction, provide a memorable and thought - provoking take on a familiar story. Her untimely death, in a car accident, made this Ms. Shepitko's final film, unfortunately. If you happen not to like black - and - white "" foreign "" films, you may still enjoy "" Voskhozhdeniye "" ( retiled in English "" The Ascent "" ).",1
What courage.,1
The laughs and gags are classic muppetism.,1
"Both men betrayed their allies to the enemy, and were forced to watch them executed. Is he wrong to do so? Shepitko pities Ryback as the Bible pities Judas. < br / > < br / >'The Ascent'draws its emotional power from Shepitko's astonishing pursuit of realism.",1
"Or, even worse, watch the Italian war movies. If you have a chance, see this Russian ( how should I call them : gems, masterpieces, hidden treasures?",1
"The greatest success of the film is its vivid sense of place. On their trip, they are spotted by German soldiers, who wound Sotnikov. It was probably not the choice, but the film is framed 1. It's not quite fair. Fantastic Russian WWII movie. 33 : 1, which gives the film a sense of claustrophobia. It's also dense in its symbolism.",1
"< br / > < br / > For me, the religiosity isn't overt. This is a movie that will mark you for life. But compared to the total experience these are quibbles. And final scene is a bit ambiguous. In fact, though not episodic - - the story flows - - this is a movie of memorable scenes.",1
"The Ascent ( 1977 ) < br / > < br / > Larisa Shepitko is a name very few are familiar with. Her last film, The Ascent, is widely regarded as one of the finest Soviet films of the 1970s. That has now changed thanks to the folks at Criterion. Not wanting to return empty handed, they continue on deeper into enemy territory. The second half of the film is filled with moral dilemmas.",1
"But none of Shepitko's films, as far as I can tell, have ever made it to video or DVD in the United States.",1
The German's arrive and the two partisans escape under fire. Its just too emotionally strenuous.,1
"Everything is reduced to a matter of survival. What Russian soldiers are left hide under cover of forests, but are forced to send food expeditions to neighboring farms. ! Like CRANES ARE FLYING ( 1957 ), this features a Russian army in retreat, a traumatizing shock early in the war when they were nearly wiped out.",1
A remarkable piece of work.,1
< br / > < br / > I suppose this is just as well given the difficulty of ever seeing a print.,1
An absolute must see.,1
"However, this is not a weakness of the film, but rather one of its greatest strengths. The Ascent deserves a second watching, as well as a third, and a tenth. In captivity, the attitude of the two men toward their fate differs greatly. Larisa Shepitko's last film is one of the most beautiful war films in cinema history.",1
An unlikely love blossoms.,1
This movie is a gem!,1
together. 'is all it takes to make a solid marriage?,1
: ) This actress is wonderful as this character and it is a poignant tale. I love foreign films and this is among the best.,1
Only Croft has come close to Hensen's genius with puppets. Half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actor / actress still alive????,1
"The final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy. See this movie, it will warm your heart.",1
"See it! I recommend movie very much. He is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers Juliette.",1
"The film isn't a preachy morality tale, but a wonderful story that will keep you hooked until the last. But its always the French that seem to show us how effortless this all is! The gorgeous Daniel Auteuil learns about true loyalty and love when his life threatens to crash around his ears.",1
asian - movies and 2. Highly enjoyable.,1
"It moves along at a great pace and is truly enjoyable. That really surprised me, due to the sheer conincidence!",1
Leaving plenty of corpses in it's wake. < br / > < br / > This film has some really impressive action scenes.,1
Also confusing is going from present to past. Mary Steenburgen does the best job of the cast. This version of the Gulliver stories is definitely bizarre.,1
Still a good show and i rate it B +. Even her son can see thru the bastard. Danson is outstanding as the title character and edward fox makes a wonderful villain.,1
Fact. ),1
"'Tis indeed what movies are made of. Full of love I suppose you might say. A zest. Anyway, I'm sort of semi - repeating myself here but I really liked the sense of family the movie had. Really, I feel like it's quite simple. Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. Hmmm, nice question! The cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance. Like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about happiness being ( like ) Let's see. Who doesn't love the muppets?!",1
But the segregation - integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at Nanny's boarding house. I always felt that Ms. Merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills. < br / > < br / > The story could be set in any major African - American community of the 50's and 60's from Atlanta's Sweet Auburn to New York's Harlem.,1
< br / > < br / > Definite a movie that could've been seen on DVD. < br / > < br / > The special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating. I felt that Ashton did a great job in the Butterfly Effect. Some of the scenes were just not believable and didn't have enough story line support.,1
"The matter is far beyond that and I would like everyone to expect that. So it is not recommended to judge of this movie, just by itself.",1
"Lemuel Gulliver ( Ted Danson ) is a doctor who goes missing at sea, leaving pregnant wife Mary ( Mary Steenburgen ) behind. It's simply a treat to watch, and it's almost amazing considering that it was a made - for - TV film.",1
This was a truly epic production that had all the elements that one would want in a fantasy film.,1
"I remember when this NBC mini - series aired when I was in high school. Law, but don't do well in a costume drama. Gulliver's small son, whom he has never met before, reminds him of the Lilliputians. I love the way his present situation reflects his flashbacks. After reading the novel, I thought I'd check out some adaptations.",1
"The Lilliput scenes suffer worse here, with the feeling that the home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive setpieces - this has to be the only version where we don't see Gulliver pulling the Blefescu fleet behind him. The England scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels, elements of which occasionally spill over into the real world.",1
"Some roles were exemplary. But the film has all the book sections within one long voyage. It becomes a natural part of this story. However, I think it will bring many readers to the book. If you have not read the book, enjoy this movie then go to the source. And I had to start it again as I began reading about this film. O'Toole's little emperor is doddering delightfully toward senility.",1
I first saw this when I was a teen in my last year of Junior High. I was riveted to it!,1
Well - filmed and acted.,1
"Mary, despite strong fantasy element in the story, is a very believable character. Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver. All great actors who create a strong supporting cast that complement Danson's superb acting ability.",1
"Still, it's dripping with satire, black and uncompromising. < br / > < br / > This movie remembers, however. Gulliver's travels criticizes everything. < br / > < br / > Swift's book is omnipresent in school libraries. Giants too, some of us may recall. Liliputians. It's a real treat. Children can read it.",1
"And have you heard voices? Great entertainment for all ages. Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, And rainbows have nothing to hide.",1
"It is a remarkable performance by a man most known for his role in Cheers, a TV comedy sitcom. A rare treat cinematography and direction. The difference in perspective between giants and midgets, all acted by real actors is beautifully captured.",1
"Lucky kiddies! The frame - story has a theme about absent fathers that many children will relate to. < br / > < br / > The same applies to this movie. I hate special effects, but here they are used to carry the story forward instead of just dazzling us. I encourage audiences to recognize a good thing by getting this movie and inspiring others to watch it.",1
"George, thinking it has developed the power of speech, drops the gnome in shock! Eventually seeing through George's lies, Mildred insists that they celebrate their anniversary at a swanky hotel. Shame. Have a good one! Instead of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke retaining their roles as writers, Dick Sharples was brought on board as the writer.",1
"How else can I say it, except, I thought she was unredeemingly awful. Riegart is juuuust right. Drag queens would kill for the glitz and glamour on display here.",1
"I'm not a big fan of movie musicals. "" But I LOVED this.",1
"But I love Bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this. and I for one think that is a good thing. I've just never been a Rosalind Russell fan although the original was my favorite RR movie. and although I missed it, I was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copy.",1
was loosely based. I was disappointed with Rosalind Russell's portrayal in the 1962 movie version.,1
"Watching this on Comcast On - Demand. < br / > < br / > This interpretation is, for me, magical. < br / > < br / > Stephen Sondheim is the King of musical theatre. < br / > < br / > The Tulsa / Louise duet / dance is on now. Fabulous.",1
"Peter Reigert is a fine Herby, if not a great singer, and Cynthia Gibb is a straight forward, natural Louise.",1
That frontier is discovered for the children. This is easily one of my favorite musicals of all time.,1
so BOO - YA for jim Henson!,1
This is one of the best TV productions of a musical ever.,1
It doesn't get any better than.,1
"It's my opinion that Midler has the volume, vibrato and presents that Merman once had.",1
"See this movie. Her singing is, simply put : MAGNIFICENT!",1
If you got the chance to see it go for it.,1
Everyone is a suspect.,1
< br / > < br / > I gave it a 9 out of 10. along with the rest of the cast. And it certainly is worth seeing. Rose McGowan was the biggest name actor / actress at the entire festival.,1
"I must tell you the truth. However, the film was very good too.",1
< br / > < br / > 9 / 10 But once it kicks in you can't turn it off.,1
"Jim Henson as Kermit, Dr. Teeth, Rowlf and Waldorf. It's such a nice movie. < br / > < br / > Charles Durning and Mel Brooks.",1
What makes this low budget production one of my favorite movies? One way the catastrophe is nothing but the end of a chain of coincidences. It has something of a Dostoevsky tale. Some try to be good.,1
The only problems I had with the cast was Rose McGowan. And he didn't let me down.,1
"That's why Mark Malone's The Last Stop a mystery thriller with blatant slasher overtones, instantly intrigued me.",1
"Must be part of his directing style to allow the actors this much room. Beside them, the movie also features Myrna Loy. It works out extremely well for this movie. Also obviously the reason why this movie is longer than most Columbo movies. Of course all really fitting for the'70's.",1
"It takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide. Alex has been having an affair with Jennifer Wells, a girl in the orchestra ( not his first affair, one suspects ). And there's even a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy films. < br / > < br / > Enter Columbo and guess what? ).",1
A. I love watching Columbo with his beloved dog who he never names in the series. Anyway I disagree with anybody who criticizes against this film.,1
"Chopin "". < br / > < br / > I know. "" Music is their job and passion, they know it well.",1
"Then when Columbo appears on the scene, it gets even better. This time he's at the vet with his new dog. As far as we learn, the dog remains nameless. ) Too bad for him our rumpled detective, Lt. Columbo ( Peter Falk ), is on the case.",1
"Now I can really feel ancient. Where's the man? "" This is another of my favorite Columbos. Everyone in the cast is great. She's sick of being back street.",1
). Some parts of the film are just kind of odd. < br / > < br / > Kermit the Frog is just an awesome character.,1
Worth seeing.,1
4 stars.,1
Values? being offered a king - sized challenge was exactly what many guys wanted. It did not work out that way. I haven't seen this fine movie in 50 years but I'm entering a comment on it anyway.,1
No explosions or bloodshed or hip soundtrack or sex.,1
Semper Fi!,1
"I actually found this movie tame by 1957 standards. If you feel this way, watch'Full Metal Jacket'with R Lee Ermey.",1
"We want smarter recruits, not meaner. Hey there Army Sgt. And yes, I am "" qualified "" to say that. How will me hitting someone make a Marine a better Marine? You are not "" qualified "" to say anything about my Marine Corps. But then again, what do I know. At least that is how I feel.",1
Right and wrong are clear and easily defined.,1
"I have the DI in my collection. A lot more. I graduated boot camp in Parris Island, SC in 1964.",1
"is the language. The only thing missing in "" The D. I. "" I think it's his best role ever.",1
"But it is memorable and every time I think of a puppet or muppet, I will think of this film. Excellent and spectacular, one of the best films of the 70 '.",1
"You can't kill the enemy if you're dead. in 1957. I. PFD. I saw "" The D. I. "" Semper Fi!",1
Well let me tel you there are nothing but sand fleas at the camp. I have been there and can appreciate it. you must watch movie to appreciate what I am saying.,1
I knew a lot of Drill Instructors and a lot of recruits. was shot.,1
Have not seen this movie on TV at all and would love to own it on DVD.,1
"Sorry, you were in the real buildings, not the sets. and Pvt. Owens ( Don Dubbins ) were not in the Marines. That is how it was done. To the best of my recollection, The Capt.",1
"The "" Ribbon Creek "" event at Parris Island had not yet affected boot camp, at least not at MCRD - San Diego. Also, he really did enjoy throwing knives. The idea of using real Marines in the movie was a great idea ( I believe they were all real Drill Instructors too ). I have often wondered if he is still alive. I. Peter J. O'Neill. He often demonstrated his skill to us that summer in boot camp. Moore's "" stiffness "" around his girl friend. As good an actor as Jack Webb was, he just couldn't "" call cadence "" like a real Marine Drill Instructor. Sgt. He was a great Drill Instructor, and I thought he did well in his bit part.",1
"I had never even heard of it until I saw it sitting in the discount video bin one day. Great stuff! THE D. I. This is probably the best work Webb has ever done... far and away better than his one - note "" Dragnet "" performances. Even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked.",1
No one has done it better than Jack Webb...,1
"< br / > < br / > Only Jim Henson could pull this off. Brilliant. In many ways, the perfect movie.",1
Extreme entertaining!,1
"< br / > < br / > Webb and Don Dubbins were serious and businesslike. Never happen for a host of reasons. When the DI was made, cursing wasn't allowed on screen. That was before I realized that DIs have to have some acting genes to get their job done.",1
Here's hoping they consider making some more episodes of same caliber. This is one of the best Non - English series I have seen.,1
"The mysteries aren't extraordinary or particularly byzantine. I'm on episode 7 of the first season, but I've already bought all four seasons and am in for the long haul. First off, I'm an American - - I haven't seen any comments on IMDb about this series yet from a U. S. viewer. Secondly, I work in the television business in development. "" Unit One "" features stand - alone cases that are committed, then solved, each week.",1
"The love story made the movie so incredible. Instead, it has become one of my favorites.",1
"But'The Muppet Movie'isn't just another jokefest, as the rest of the diminishing - return Muppet films would become. 9. ( One can only wonder what Henson would have made of his family's management of the company after his death. )",1
"Watch it with someone you truly love. I keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. Instead let's focus on how the story was told. When it comes to morality I agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence. The locales in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters. < br / > < br / > I must admit rarely have I seen such a wonderfully crafted film. Why do It's an admixture of flashbacks and the present. What I found out was a cinematic delight and should, I repeat'should'always be watched with an open mind.",1
"There couldn't have been a better actor for the job. He wants this woman but he cannot have her, Fiennes brings the human - like qualities out of Almásy in way absolutely NO OTHER actor could. < br / > < br / > Many will criticize this film based on its so called "" glorification of adulterers "", but those who do know nothing.",1
Thanks Ondaatje thanks Mingela. i don't believe so.,1
"First and foremost, why, oh why are the modern films so long? It makes you think. He is the strongest link here. This is not a film for relaxation. Ralph Fiennes is a smashing superb actor. It is obvious, terrible, and bloody. War is here, too.",1

"), then you can appreciate "" The English Patient "" as a throwback to the intelligent, layered, sweeping epics of David Lean in the'60s.

But by the end, everyone should realize this is a big message piece of art. The hero talks about how a new car, broken - down car, fast car, etc. Frankly, some of the intense displays of love were laughable and seem to be on the edge of parody. I think the film could've been made even better than it is.",1
"This film is about aging Geisha in post war Tokyo. That they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece. If you have a region free DVD player, you should attempt to find the two Naruse box sets released in England.",1
One could weep for cinematography this magnificent.,1
"< br / > < br / > That's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The English Patient "" contains very much of what made those films so powerful.

He was true to himself but thought about his audience.,1
"< br / > < br / > The fact that his name does not sound like he's English plays a key role in what unfolds. The film makes clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living, or worth dying for. The film is beautifully photographed, and like'Lawrence ', is set in Northern Africa, but during the second world war.",1
"Yet, the war is raging relentlessly. Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Meanwhile, Hana herself falls for a Sihk man in the British bomb squad.",1
"Juliette Binoche is the posterchild for vulnerability and childlike enthusiasm. So much was promised with this film, and so much is delivered! She simply must be THE best actress since likes of Deborah Kerr.",1
"Well, for those who are interested, watch this film. Okin doesn't have any children, but the other do. Very good film indeed.",1
"A worthy winner of so many awards. It is "" multi - layered "" ; there is so much to see and appreciate. I like this movie above all others.",1
; - ) enjoy... < br / > < br / > I give this movie 4. I for one think that is a good sign.,1
"I've seen a few movies in my time, but this one is exceptional. It combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics all in one.",1
"And though he survives the crash, he is severely burned. Slowly, however, under prompting from Hana, Almasy begins to remember bits and pieces of his life, and his story begins to unfold.",1
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Ulrich Thomsen does a great job too. It is about true love and friendship.,1
"This was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn't be a story. < br / > < br / > As a TV movie, thanks to Colin and a strong script, this is a well above average TV movie. Hence the title. Her lies sink her deeper and deeper into a self - loath hole, causing her to make a bad situation worse.",1

"Luckily the child didn't die, but is seriously injured and in a coma. < br / > < br / > The thing about this movie is that you don't choose sides. Joanna is very much a good role model, even though she's made some wrong choices. In the end, I wanted to see more of her.",1

"Furthermore, each character in this film represents either a past leader or event. Babs Johnson grew up in a very non - typical home. Chicken, is a 1970's slang term for woman. Some view Hitler as a genius, others a mad man. Another coincidence is Edith's obsession with eggs.",1
There is one couple.....,1
"Meanwhile the moneylender is herself unhappy, despite her fortunes. But the film is full of good points.",1
"Believe what you hear, it is trash!",1
They long to outdo her in being the filthiest person alive. It's a film that's fun for the whole family. ( well depending on where you live? ),1
"The film has a soundtrack from 60'rock and roll artists. Enjoy. I was disgusted but for some sick reason i enjoyed it. I found "" Female Trouble "" a little more fun.",1
It expands films. But just see.,1
I laughed. The acting is horrific. Pink Flamingos is awesome.,1
Easily perfect 10!,1
Just read his biography Shock Value. It discusses the lengths he went through to get this film finished. Waters possesses. It's getting you nowhere.,1
Rating - 10 Classic Waters!,1
I loved this thing. Says a lot about us ( us being people ) doesn't it.,1
I'd give it 15 out 10 if I could. The infamous dog - scene has to be one of the highlights of cinema. The film that gave us John Waters is one of the funniest films ever. Mink Stole is hysterical.,1
"Maybe he should have kept them intact. This doesn't mean innovative editing in the way Godard would introduce it with "" Breathless "" in 1959, but quite the opposite. In this sense the film was comparable to Ozu's and Mizoguchi's work, but somehow even more subtle. < br / > < br / > I feel that Naruse's editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films, elevating the stories significance beyond the obvious. Unfortunately I haven't yet the feeling that Naruse was able I found the story itself to be rather conventional.",1

"Trust me when I say that this film is not one to be quickly forgotten, especially the end scene in which Divine eats dog crap off the sidewalk. Divine ( a fat guy in drag ) is an unbelievably vile human being, who actually becomes painful to watch.",1
"The film ends with Divine, Waters'300 lbs.",1
"I always rate, so I just figure what the heck? You know the saying "" Curiosity Killed The Cat ""? My God, this movie was so weird! Through the grossness of this film, you have got to give John Waters some credit, who the heck would ever think of this movie over 35 years later?",1
"< br / > < br / > This film is very much NOT for everyone. It's disgusting but, in a way, not unwatchable. It's a in your face no holds barred assault in bad taste. The film shows their attempts to outdo each other.",1
"It is like a form of assault, albeit a funny one. It is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really aspire to be like any other movie you've seen. The people in his films are completely in tune with one another. What's there to say about "" Pink Flamingos ""?",1
"A very strange, disturbing but intriguing film.",1
Even some of the lines are rather mind - blowing. Because you know that only John Waters can do that.,1

The characters and plot line keep holding you. The ending was superb.,1
I stumbled upon this movie by chance.,1
They should play it on history channel or something. It was more or less an original concept that really grabbed your attention. Yeah I watched this mini series with My Mom and dad as a kid. I would imagine not.,1
I've watched it several times since then and I still enjoy it. I would love for film to be released on DVD.,1
com Thank you very much for you help. This is one of the best TV series that I have ever watched. my e - mail address is yurets777 @ hotmail.,1
"If you haven't read the book, you should really find a copy. I gave it a rating of 10. This was a great film and an even better novel by Robert Fish. I can say unhesitatingly that it holds up even to this day.",1
"< br / > < br / > I don't know why so many people are comparing this film to "" The Castle "" though they have similar themes running through them, Take Away stands in a league of its own. to me it looks like somewhere between Ivanhoe to Bullen, though I am not 100 % sure on that one. < br / > < br / > The Cinematography could have been better, more shots of the local area would've been nice, from what I can see it was in Melbourne, but where in Melbourne? The ending was hilarious even though I have found many who disagree with me on that one. I highly recommend it. When I watched Take Away, I must say that the sun did shine in my house.",1
"Subtle, delicate, touching. Religious traces and a pantheist vision.",1
< br / > < br / > Wirey Spindell is a great film with great dialog.,1
Give this flick a chance. It's sad that this movie is so low - rated.,1
"I was, as many of you, also sucked in and watched the entire film. But I bought in... and enjoyed it immensely. I was hooked, at first, by the literate dialogue and wry sense of humour that the film is rich with. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect.",1
An example of genius filmaking. The acting is outstanding. I thank him.,1
I disagree with the imdb.,1
"This kind of ending is something that Hollywood would probably change if it was their script. He is utterly heartbroken and feels no worse off in the Russian labor camp. Overall, a worthwhile movie.",1
"It also has some strong visual special affects. The younger guy is quite naughty, that is cute.",1
Ill get sources if needed In a spit. Not at all Biggles.,1
"I replied, "" Thank God! "" If you appreciate beautiful and understate acting, see this one.",1
I highly recommend this film. The pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against Nazi pilots.,1
"Not the mention it's one of the best films I've seen in all genres. I might have written this for No Man's Land before, but now I think this one's better. That really didn't fit into this adorable film. < br / > < br / > Briefly, this film is a total masterpiece and every single individual should see it. But it's pretty much the only flaw I've noticed.",1
"A solid production all around. It's always interesting as an American to see a new point of view on familiar events in history. This is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema. Still, it is compelling all the way through.",1
they find that all his clothes have been stolen. His gay companion is sexually excited. On returning to the beach.,1
This is such a beautiful movie! I definitely recommend this movie to all people.,1
The Czech pilot who played piano gives a mellow touch to the story.,1
"Absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all times on so many levels. There are a few subplots, all of which are worth careful attention. Easily a candidate for any aviation enthusiast's personal DVD collection.",1
"< br / > < br / > Dark Blue World also works quite well outside the arena of the war film as being a story about human relationships. < br / > < br / > This may not be a film for everyone. Dark Blue World instead ventures into the world of refugee soldiers fighting in exile for their occupied nations. This relationship is extremely well acted throughout, developing into almost a father and son relationship at many points.",1
"When he can't pronounce a word, he ridicules the lesson. This movie would make General Patton weep. Don't say I didn't warn you. And if you are a dog lover, you'll use up half a box of Kleenex.",1
It's entertaining in spite of the'sad'premise. ( So it's a foreign film with English language and includes British actors. ),1
"However there is a bond of friendship that goes beyond merely being friendly. Remember they were not the winners, the defeated the Germans only to be invaded by the Russians.",1
"I'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon. Watch for the feelings, not for their objects.",1
"To all people who want to see great movie... this is the one! This is without any doubt more than dark chapter in our history, although the fact that those brave men we're able to go through all this and recover afterward is amazing. It's worth of it! )",1
"If all war films were like this, we'd never have to fight again. < br / > < br / > Did I mention it's worth watching? enhances, rather than detracts from the whole.",1
And then immediately'we'need to jump back into combat mode and focus on survival. I've been a devoted IMDB visitor for a few years. ).,1
I would recommend it to everyone.,1
"Without doubt the most brutal, direct, and frightfully swift air combat scenes ever replicated for film. If you love flying, see this. < br / > < br / > But back to the film.",1
"There's even a nice little cameo role for the apparently famous Czech musician and actor ( and Kevin Kline lookalike ) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays on the piano the title theme song, Dark Blue Sky. Excellent! But best of all is the sensational musical score from Ondrej Soukup, as good as anything from Hans Zimmer yet all in the tradition of the late, excellent Ron Goodwin who scored the original Battle of Britain film amongst other classic English war films. Also, the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language ( though made easier here with the great stalwart Anna Massey ).",1
"Movie is half in English and some actors are Britons. But if you like happy ends, DBW is not for you. It's first big - screen movie about Czechoslovak WWII soldiers since "" Nebesti jezdci "" ( 1968 ). But greatest thing about this movie is it's pure existence. He wrote this theme when he lost his eyes... < br / > < br / > Leading characters are older and wiser Frantisek and young Karel.",1
"Finally they fight gallantly in the Battle of Britain. < br / > < br / > In terms of romantic sub - plot, this is very similar to the Hollywood production Pearl Harbour. Highly recommended. However, Frantisek and Karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman. Honza is severely maltreated by his Communist countrymen and dies.",1
I absolutely loved this movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > Well, forget it. The movie starts with a little black humour, and then gets started. Everything becomes simple and basic, life is without nonsense. This does have a great impact on the movie, according to me it makes it better. It's horror, but you can't feel but sympathy for the little mute. But this movie doesn't let you go.",1
< br / > < br / > Writing and direction are magnificent!!!,1
"It's all about getting what you want when you want it. Such a movie with such a cast only comes around, after all, once in a... ummm... blue moon. < br / > < br / > Most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn't relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue.",1
"Enjoy. Don't miss this film, it is great entertainment by great veteran actors.",1
Humour at anytime and very subtle. A film for men too confident with women.,1
"Apparently nobody thinks that Cooper can buy the total pair and sell half to Colbert. She is seen as quite mercenary towards Cooper - selling herself to him on her terms. This film reappeared on channel 13 in the 1990s when they did a series of comedies from Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. So the sale is not allowed. But he only likes to sleep in the tops. "". What if Brooke sells them each half? That is Communism!!",1
"Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were enchanted. I think this film can be considered as the return of Ernst Lubitsch. It looks like a catastrophe. The clerk says he must buy the pants too. Of Course, Lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process. I thought "" The Taming of the Shrew "" was very funny. But he sleeps only in the tops. < br / > < br / > I got this information from a book.",1
"Of course Cooper is an American and Colbert of the cast is the only one actually of French background. Herman Bing has the best supporting role in the film as that selfsame, flustered detective. Sounds like what we now call a pre - nuptial agreement. She'd like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get it. But Cooper's a good sport about it, he always settles with his ex - wives for a $ 50, 000. < br / > < br / > Of course Claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels Cooper takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage.",1
Claudette Colbert is only terrific and gets great backing from Edward Everett Horton as her impoverished titled father. The film is full of sight - gags like this balanced with verbal wit which makes it just about perfect.,1
"The film kept my interest wonderfully. I found myself laughing almost constantly. Leonard Maltin disliked it. Enter Claudette Colbert, one of thirties cinema's most beautiful, charming, and talented personalities. and Pauline Kael ( not a great surprise ) blasted the film in her scathing review.",1
"If only they had made this show about Islam in America without the terrorism, it would have been first rate. < br / > < br / > If only the Moderate Muslim scholar had been the main character of the show.",1
Everybody should see this show!,1
And that'why I hate it so much.,1
"Terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, anytime. The most chilling drama I've ever seen. A well respected business man, who pretends to be Jewish and a Frenchman who has converted to Islam, but has clearly taken the word of the Koran to a whole new level.",1
This show is not 24 or any of the cop shows on TV and is not trying to be anything either. This is an extremely well done show. I have found this show by accident and was surprised to find out that nobody I know has ever heard of it. It is genuine and unique.,1
"To the uninitiated, there is much to be learnt about the Muslim faith here. People in the US have known for a long time that Showtime is the new HBO, they are making far better cutting edge, powerful shows and this is no exception.",1
"Smartly written, well acted, intense and suspenseful. It tries to present both sides of Islam.",1
I give 7 of 10. And more intense with a FBI's infiltrate. Also I hoped more definitions about characters stories.,1
Would it happen? ).,1
"It wasn't until episode four ( "" Scholar "" ) when I was well and truly impressed. < br / > < br / > I read the synopsis on the DVD cover and I was immediately intrigued. No way, this is a first! The main protagonist is Muslim? He's very charismatic and authoritative. It's clever and open - minded I would like to commend on the great writing and also, superb performances from the actors.",1
"This was a touching, heartfelt film with a wonderful cast. < br / > < br / > The first half of the film is virtually non - stop music. As played by Merkerson, character of Nanny simply radiates love.",1
24 is a cartoon.,1
"< br / > < br / > I'd be curious to know what went wrong. I enjoyed this series, but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording / mixing.",1
< br / > < br / > The writers know their material and it shows. Ren this series at once!,1
"Having been married to a Muslim myself, the atmosphere created was quite realistic. Somebody give Fehr more juicy roles like this one and let him run with it. Despite that, it is a raw gripping series that will make you think.",1
"It'a sure winner in my eyes, and I have no problems stating that this series is on my list of all time best. Highly authoritative and extremely cunning.",1
"< br / > < br / > Success but no happiness here. Ms. Vinson, as the 2nd wife, is also quite effective.",1
"), and the music is awfully hokey.",1
< br / > < br / > This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry.,1
"Well, this film came on on a workday at 230am.",1
"The film is beautifully written, acted and directed, and I highly recommend it. Tom's ambitious wife Sally was responsible for all of Tom's success.",1
"Astonishing! She does most of the scene without dialogue, which is where her silent acting experience gives her edge, even over Tracy. Then I saw her fabulous silent comedy work in films like "" Ella Cinders "" and "" Orchids and Ermine "". Then the disappointingly sombre talkie "" The Scarlet Letter "".",1
I have been looking for it. I don't think @ all that it was a bad movie.,1
"You know you've become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who has somehow gone on to live a This is intimate in setting but not in tone. In that last part, there's another brave step taken as we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast. This isn't a problem but an asset : we need a few little visual seg - ways to go between these interviews.",1
"< br / > < br / > It's charming, delightful, sad, funny, and everything in between.",1
"In the spirit of the Great Space Coaster, but a few years earlier. They would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it. < br / > < br / > No one else I know remembers it at all.",1
"This educational show focused on emotions, interactions, and relationships. Wow, the memories that resurfaced!",1
"Right On! "" There was always a moral in every episode. We would always see more Seymore.",1
My favourite story from'tales from the crypt '.,1
"With him he has a companion, a young hare hit by a car. The hare falls ill and they must return to Helsinki to see the vet. The bestseller is one of the best books I've read.",1
"An old hangar is used as film location. Mute Witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody. And a very cool one, I may say. Some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end.",1
Jäniksen vuosi is one of Jarva's most political movies.,1
All Risto Jarva's films are worth of seeing.,1
"Adventure and technology. < br / > < br / > I did not know what this concept of a "" pilot "" was. < br / > < br / > Back then, would I understood what so many people hate about the movie now? I suppose it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it is. I doubt it because I don't remember it as such. Not really for to understand the story, one must not see it from their perspective but rather from that of the characters in the movie. Do I understand now?",1
It was a shame it did not make it to a series. If you liked this feature the other one is worth a watch. Yet different. Also known as Doppleganger. I just picked up The Stranger off of eBay on VHS.,1
2 out of 10.,1
most of the actors are pretty decent in their roles. brrr.,1
Is it Slaussen? Is it Davy? The mannequins??,1
"The capper is a great impalement by pipe with blood dripping out of the end. Co - star Tanya Roberts ( a brunette in this film ) is okay in support. As night falls, the kids get picked off in record time. ( It should then come as no surprise that TCSM art director Robert A. Burns repeats that duty here, and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy. )",1
This is a VERY good movie. I give it a 10.,1
"Of course, the VW Thing has mysteriously died at that point, so odd Mr. Slausen ( Chuck Connors ) offers his help. Tourist Trap "" is among my favorite late 70's / early 80's horror flicks. And who is Davey? 7 out of 10. At any rate there's somewhat of a twist to this and kind ( but weird ) Mr. Slausen is not exactly what he appears to be.",1
They pay dearly. I really really liked this one. These aren't the anorexic broads from today's horrible horror ; they look awesome in booty shorts.,1
"A horror movie without a good setting isn't very fun, not here. Which makes it creepier.",1
"Once at the creepy roadside attraction, the friends are stalked by a mask - wearing lunatic who can bring the museum's dummies to life through the power of the mind.",1
beware. Even after so many years the movie hasn't lost its charm and thrill.,1
From then on I would never judge a film based on it's rating again. This is most likely what happened to Tourist Trap. ( Director David Schmoeller talks about this problem on the DVD's commentary track. ) 9 % of the horror films that have come out of Hollywood lately. The'heart burst'scene alone should be enough for film to be slapped with and R rating. If you don't believe me see Darkness Falls or They. When the film opened in 1979 it was given a PG rating by the MPAA. That alone was enough to guarantee Poltergeist success. Or how about the pipe in the back with the blood running out of it. ),1
"The wax figures look "" so real, "" one of the teen's points out.",1
"Those elements are usually used to cover the lack of thrills in a film. Here, the scares are merited and effective. A classic scene indeed.",1
"Face it - the damn things are scary enough, without the music and the script. It doesn't matter.",1
"< br / > < br / > Well worth repeated viewing, but not on dark nights when you'all alone!",1
This movie is a Masterpiece. This is fantastic!,1
"It was memorable. Hell, dolls are creepy! Pretty good company. And what about the magnificent Twilight Zone episode "" Living Doll "".",1
< br / > < br / > One of the most under - appreciated horror movies of the late 70's!,1
"After awaiting for Eileen, Becky and Molly go to look for her. Tourist Trap "" is a bizarre, great horror film from the'70s. Mannequins are creepy to begin with, they're so lifelike yet they really aren't. Well, it is. < br / > < br / > Sound similar to the 2005 "" House of Wax "" remake?",1
"I highly, highly recommend this film! ) < br / > < br / > "" The soup is very good. "" It feeeeeeeeeels good! "" Everyone should own it. com. < br / > < br / > "" How's that? "" I mean, who was possibly better?!",1
"< br / > < br / > The youngsters'curiosity gets the best of them and they go exploring. The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget. < br / > < br / > The seemingly telekinetic abilities of the killer to lock bolts and animate the wax dummies, is used to great effect. Slausen has one warning for the youngsters : Stay away from Davey, Slausen's reclusive and disturbed brother. The trap is sprung!",1
The mannequins look very sinister and the climax is horrifying.,1
"Slausen's Lost Oasis... a place for food, fun... and MURDER! Can the friends escape or will they fall to the same fate as their lost friend? It's nothing, however, that would detract from the effect of the film.",1
Slausen brings his freaky assortment of uncomfortably human - like mannequins to life and picks off the kids one by one so he can add them to his ever - growing collection of victims. < br / > < br / > Five teenagers traveling through the desolate California desert by car get hopelessly lost.,1
Chuck Connors is great as Mr. Slaus. I love this movie!,1
A number of the film's sequences are quite memorable.,1
"The fast pacing and the groovy killer - icon caused this "" Tourist Trap "" to earn a spot amongst my 5 favorite slashers. The plot twists aren't always original and the acting is pretty lousy but, seriously, who cares? A bit surprising is total lack of nudity, though. Don't you just hate them slashers that never seem to get started? is spoken. Plenty of it AND constantly from start to finish! Tourist Trap "" isn't like that!",1
"There is very little gore, but the violence is quite strong for PG - rated horror film. 9 out of 10. The mannequins look very sinister and the climax is horrifying. """,1
"There are very few things in cinema that can be frightening by simply being there - but wax statues are definitely one of those things. It's not the acting that's the star of the show, however, and as you might expect - the creepy atmosphere takes that prize. On the whole, this is a very good film. While Tourist Trap might not be absolutely essential viewing ; it'well worth seeing and I can recommend it.",1
They has a cat and it murderously disappeared. When they do they use it against her.,1
"Go rent The Hills Have Eyes or something along those lines. The monsters are unique and believable. Not the kitty, noooooo, why?",1
"Troll "" & "" Don't Be Afraid of the Dark "" come to mind. The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.",1
The family cat also disappears. 7 / 10.,1
You are stuck to the movie from the beginning to the very end.,1
I loved every minute of it.,1
A lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures to China.,1
A very enjoyable film.,1
"Light as a soufflé, but I enjoyed every minute.",1
< br / > < br / > My rating / 10. It's one of my top bad movies.,1
"00 each for them. The snake was cool, but I guess it does borrow a little from Conan. I think Ator is cool!",1
And very original. I love this movie!,1
This one features invisible attackers and samurai.,1
"For a lower budget movie, this film does good in terms of setting and the fights are most of the time believable. The movie climaxes in a most unusual way, quite anachronic, but breathtaking : the deltaplane sequence.",1
I can't say I recommend buying this film. ).,1
"His introduction you prop it explains ATOR's origin to us with images of the first part. Never it becomes boring. lacking mas violence and blood, but this one well. Expectacular THE ATOR's second part!!",1
< br / > < br / > What can I say? - all in all this movie is a veritable delight!,1
His choice of theatre leads to an inevitable conflict with his father. Therefore Jews are presented as part and parcel of American society. Nobody in this film has a Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee appeared in very few feature films. The synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice. The Jazz Singer ( 1952 ) is no different.,1
?,1
"However, young Mr. Golding has quite a zest for show business. If anything, this is glossed over. < br / > < br / > This time the Cantor's son was played by Danny Thomas. < br / > < br / > At this time, he meets Peggy Lee, an aspiring singer. His singing is up to par as the film ends on a positive note.",1
I swear. That all turns into Chaos.,1
What lies beneath - over hyped and crap.,1
The cast was well picked.,1
Pauly is Funny.,1
"i'm not going to reveal the end, but i liked it. when travis decides to propose, becca needs a distraction.",1
"And I think she thought there was more. The movie never showed them actually become a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. They never even actually kissed at any point, although there was one part where they almost did. Well they never really show a close up of the ring ). When her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts him on the spot. Crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. That was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand.",1
"The rest of the cast does a fine job, especially underrated Carla Gugino.",1
Tomfoolery?,1
"There is a plenty of comic relief, too. ).",1
"He is one hell of a culture shock. Not bad, not bad at all.",1
"If you have a chance, see this movie! A couple of scenes had me laughing almost uncontrollably.",1
I love Pauly Shore. It seems some people don't agree. I love it!,1
One of our all time family favorites. Pauly Shore is brilliant! This is fun for viewers of all ages.,1
One of those films I have no problem watching when it is on TV.,1
William tell is the Swiss version of Robin Hood.,1
He is secretive and avoids friendship. The camera work is also excellent. His life is dominated by order and regularly. The film unfolds to us in a similar way.,1
"Eventually he does respond to Magnani - he has to do so or they would be no film. With an imagination that good the friend should be WRITING not Dreaming. We ' Dream or not SOMEONE, and the obvious candidate is director Paolo Sorrentino, has created a very watchable world in which Tony Servillo makes stillness a Fine Art.",1
Except for the sister. I enjoyed the acting in this movie. The guy falling out of the exploding car?,1
"The movie does have problems. Still, worth catching. Still, they turn in OK performances.",1
"Instead its more a movie with its own style, that does things its own way. < br / > < br / > It's hard to place this movie under one label.",1
"You will not sleep through this lecture. Both had wonderful music and riveting performances. Both dealt with love between a man and a woman. < br / > < br / > But film is not mere comedy. Both had the main characters living in a "" hotel "".",1
"Meanwhile Tittas phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to speak to him. From the title you might expect a Bergmanesq dissection of a relationship. < br / > < br / > Consequences of Love is that kind of film. He once had it all, but now is now living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel.",1
"Just brutality and business, and no more. !",1
"Love kills. Am I a sad case? I look forward to your next film. Thankyou Mr Sorrentino. I've seen this film so many times, It's that good. As for the story of the film, I'm bias.",1
His wife realises this is but a pipe dream. The husband is constantly dreaming about recovering his lost wealth and making a grand statement to the world. This nicely counterpoints resignation of Girolami who sees no way out and does not seek one.,1
"I still have yet to talk to anyone who has seen this. Tony Servillo is superb, as is Magnani. It outwitted me at every turn and I was constantly surprised by the story.",1
I rate this movie 9 / 10.,1
"This is, without doubt, one of my favourite horror films ever! By a series of events, she finds herself accidentally locked in, and stumbles on the filming of a snuff movie.",1
< br / > < br / > Go and see it.,1
But it's the only little mistake. I'd like very much the lighting work on it. One of my favorite Italian films.,1
"How? Now, Titta knows about their squabbles, their love, the man's cheating, his apologies to his wife, and his whining.",1
PS Toni keep on acting like this we need an encore. Definitely a must see for people who enjoy the European / Italian cinema.,1
"There are not you'average clichés and it's definitively worth seeing this one. The actor, Toni Servillo, is superb, he excels this "" quiet man "".",1
"Many compliments to director, and thank you, cinema needs these movies.",1
He's a tax expert gone wrong who lives in a hotel. Don't see this if you're an action - buff. < br / > < br / > I won't spoil the rest of the film.,1
"It does indeed reveal Di Girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. At one point in his non - life, Titta decides to feel concern about appearing "" ridiculous "". The first half of the film may be described as "" slow "" by some. He says : you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth.",1
"So watch it, then decide. Don't expect a $ 10 million film. cuz you'll be disappointed. Movies are meant to entertain, and this movie sure does that.",1
One of my all - time favourite movies. Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time.,1
But that doesn't make the film any better. I own this movie.,1
"Who killed the replacement girl and why? < br / > < br / > I wish I taped it though, I'd like to see it again. < br / > < br / > This would have given the viewer a sporting chance at figuring out the solution.",1
"< br / > < br / > Anthony James plays one of his classic TV bad guy roles. It's also interesting to note that Gerald McRaney had a role in this Rockford file episode. < br / > < br / > The gender of the victim was changed, the surviving spouse is one of Rick's "" old flames "".",1
The crime bosses responded by killing Karen and substituting another woman into Jim's car. ( 2 ) What did Karen actually see at the hotel that made the mafia kill her? This episode shows a side of Jim Rockford that is usually ignored. ' This is personal for Jim Rockford.,1
< br / > < br / > Really good episode in a Class A series. Easily deserves a 10.,1
"To be sure, the eventual explanation is a little far - fetched.",1
"This is a very noir kind of episode. Frankly, they were right, though I prefer later Lt. Chapman to Lt. Diehl. And I'm smarter than you! "" She looks terrific here. So of course that makes Jim an immediate suspect. This time, its Vincent Minette who Rockford helps apprehend. It also goes a long way to show that Rocky isn't just some clueless old man either.",1
"When the "" second honeymoon "" cruise Gardner inveigles Granger into leaves the trio ( and Granger's dog ) marooned on a south sea island ( were there other survivors? < br / > < br / > Reason ( which Granger considers his strong point ) reigns and frustration reigns supreme - for a while.",1
"Not the best of movies, but definitely well worth watching.",1
Bergman and comedy don't quite go together. Some of his comedies are so naff you almost wince.,1
"The shock, fear, horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the film. Even though there are many new faces their performances were top class. U never know when they will get killed or what they are up to. I don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long. so it is all the more tense. Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock.",1
Bergman is a sublime comedy director and writer.,1
"the master produced some of the richest, warm and touching movies I have ever seen. But the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary, you almost wish it not to end. May he rest in peace!",1
< br / > < br / > BT My Heart is still racing...,1
"He was right - I was hooked immediately. He insisted that I give two episodes a shot : "" Once More With Feeling "" and this one. So I went out and bought Season One boxed set. < br / > < br / > Both of them are why I am a BUFFY fan today.",1
"This is a good episode, but it's not my favorite. Anya claims that Xander won't really talk to her. So they steal the voices of everyone in town. He's a commando and she's the Slayer. Giles ignores It really is a classic. < br / > < br / > "" Hush "" revolves around the entire town losing their voices.",1
"The Gothic scenario of final battle against "" The Gentlemen "" recalls the environment of "" Dark City "". My vote is ten.",1
Also number three of Joss'personal favorites as well. That should tell you something. Unfortunately it didn't win.,1
"Not a hands - down fantastic episode, but a solid concept with more horror movie references. Episode No.",1
"Besides, what really counts in this episode is the wondrously sinister truck and its virulent attacks. It's Dean's behavior towards Cassie sheds a whole new light on him, in fact. To a certain level I agree with the racism debate, but it didn't bother me that much, really.",1
Aweso e episode.,1
"But don't worry. And, oh boy, she did a wonderful job. < br / > < br / > The plot get twisted near the end, possibly misleading at one particular moment. Such delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy - / girl - / friend.",1
"His daughter Cassie Robinson calls her former boyfriend Dean and asks him to investigate the mysterious accident. < br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) : "" Rota 666 "" ( "" Route 666 "" ) My vote is seven.",1
FAITHFULLY!!,1
"Return to Lonesome Dove was to me, almost up to the quality of the first of the series. The next 2 follow ups with James Garner as Call just didn't make it for me. And that Lorena marries Pea Eye? That was a total mismatch of characters.",1
"Do yourself a favor and check it out, Ol'Gus would be proud! Upon viewing'return'I can honestly say it's a worthy successor.",1
High recommended.,1
"I wasn't expecting it to measure up. But so what? Louis Gossett jr. deserves special mention as horse wrangler Isom Pickett. After watching the first episode it was clear that this is no "" Lonesome Dove "".",1
"Great cast, great story. He is Captain Call. Most definitely a close second to Lonesome Dove.",1
"Call. The story, acting, production, cinematography are all top - notch. How wrong I was. If Tommy Lee Jones wasn't playing Capt. The story isn't all roses, it has it's surprises too. Of course the script isn't as colorful as Lonesome Dove but it has it's moments.",1
"A rich experience is to be gained from watching this film. Firstly there is a real depth to the communication between him and Choi Lam. It becomes clear that she genuinely likes him, and it's mutual. The student, Choi Lam, draws pictures of him during class, significantly, one of him with a flower coming from his mouth. He is married with two sons, and things at home seem normal. < br / > < br / > Recommended without reservation.",1
"The movie is very dramatic and touching. It is slow moving, but stay with it. It is worth time to witness and just be there with her.",1
A beautiful and moving story.,1
"Hats off to Ann Hui for the direction and Ivy Ho for the brilliant script. Again, excellent. Might be a good double feature with American Beauty as well.",1
"Hummmm,... ANOTHER Keystone comedy set in the park!! Things get complicated when the mother'watch is stolen. ! Fatty finds it and gives it to Mabel as a gift,... and MANY problems result.",1
But this picture works the other way around.,1
"Either way, this film makes you look forward to seeing more of their work. This film is an excellent example of what an independent film can be.",1
< br / > < br / > The action and drama are worth every penny. BUT Two Coyotes is an exceptional film.,1
"I was very impressed with this film from newcomer Dir. The cast was excellent. "" / Writer Jose Reyes.",1
"< br / > < br / > The filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out. There will be no mistake you're watching a movie made for grown - ups. The plot twists and turns unpredictably. The horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage - slasher pic. I mean, Alec Guinness is in it, briefly, and you know he didn't NEED the work! < br / > < br / > And a teen - slasher pic it AIN'T.",1
Don't expect any kind of religious experience.,1
Ackroyd and Matthau play off very well off one another. A lost 80s gem.,1
"My expectations dropped even lower. * Then I figured out that it had something to do with a mental institute and a patient escaping. < br / > < br / > Burns escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist, and drives to O'Hare. People love him! """,1
"A lot of people don't think Dan Aykroyd is funny. This movie proves otherwise. "".",1
"< br / > < br / > Jeff Trust me, its fairly accurate.",1
But I think the Couch Trip is probably his best and funniest. Any guy will love this flick check out. 50 shipping fee. Dan Ackroyd is plain and simpley hillarious period.,1
7. Charles Grodin throws in a good supporting performance too. 2 from all the IMDB voters.,1
"I wasn't expecting much, so it came as a big surprise that I loved it so much. < br / > < br / > This is the type of film that Dan Aykroyd seems to love to make. ! A chance for him to'ham it up'and not take things too seriously.",1
Then the story gets more and more outrageous.,1
"But "" The Couch Trip "" uses this as a springboard for everything else. First, "" The Great Outdoors "" and now this. It's criminal they haven't used him more often. He gets strong support from other great comic actors. Richard Romanus plays Grodin's slimeball lawyer to perfection. Now, a dumb comedy would just be about this.",1
"He'the man! It had everything, man! And I almost forgot! Uncle Jimmy... Oh! He's always funny.",1
"< br / > < br / > Opinion? A Great show. Mel Gibsons "" Safety videos "" were a highlight of the series as well.",1
Love the gang of actors!,1
"Each show is excellent. Oh, yes! When is it on? All time. Some people actually like to laugh and not have to think afterward. Please learn a lesson. Shame it got canceled.",1
They should put COMPLETE SAVAGES on NICKELODEON more than what they do! Iknow that they can and they should!!!! ! I say that you should give them a chance to do more episodes. It is one of my favourites!!!,1
Teen Deviyaan is a great film. He eventually opts for Nanda. etc.,1
Devanand played lead character and has fully justified his contemporary romantic image. Ultimately he goes to a astrologer and asked him who he loves most. He asked for few days from all of them.,1
"< br / > < br / > A must see for any Hindi film buff, I will rate the eternal favourite 9. Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda. 5 out of 10.",1
The question is which one is the'One'for him. The music was wonderful and Dev Anand as a city bred looked and acted his best. But we were in for a pleasant surprise. If you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact. What makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too.,1
"Firstly, it portrays the atmosphere of the whole movie perfectly. < br / > < br / > * End Scenepoiler * < br / > < br / > I have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. She hears a noise, looks in a room, and there is her partner in a pool of blood. Here, in "" Mute Witness "", we find a prime example of this.",1
"To some extent, this might even be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses. For all intents and purposes,'Teen Devian'might seem like just another lightweight Bollywood musical.",1
but the rest is way different. this flick is strange but i liked it a lot. Sienna Miller is really good. ! like get to see James Franco in a wig. its weird yeah!,1
we all really loved it a lot. !,1
This movie rocked!!!! good date flick David Carradine plays cowboy and he is good. James plays a jerk but you end up liking him and the end of the movie is really good.,1
I loved it!!! ! I hope it comes out soon - does anyone know when?,1
"He has nothing to be ashamed of. Others have revealed spoilers, but I won't. There have been movies with with similar setup e. g. "" Ghost "". I like him as an actor and also thought he did a terrific job. I loved it.",1
But a twist soon turns the tale upside down.,1
There seems to be no creativity in Hollywood. < br / > < br / > This movie is a welcome change.,1
Really great movie! Super original.,1
The Psychopath ( 1973 ) A trip down memory lane. What happens next is priceless. Pretty violent for a P. G. movie. < br / > < br / > Recomded.,1
If you enjoy suspense this movie has it.,1
It gives the ordinary guy / girl the chance to be on television singing as their favourite stars.,1
There is lots of action and lots of blood. The acting isn't great but its passable. A good popcorn movie. I have certainly seen worse.,1
"Brilliant comedy, excellent stuff! 1 Damon Wayans should make a come back!",1
Great show for the family.. Great p 13 rated show.,1
"Michael, Jay, Claire, Junior Kadie... we love you! Beautiful & talented. < br / > < br / > - George O. Gore II : perfect for the paper. Let's see : - Damon Wayans : no commentaries. Se has a perfect timing and always get the point of the joke. It's one of my favorites TV series. < br / > < br / > - Noah Grey - Cabey : this boy have future, i'm sure of it. < br / > < br / > - Parker McKeena Posey : impossible to not fall in love for her.",1
My wife and kids is a good and funny series that truly shows the worries and problems that happen the most even in the best families. She has many problems with her parents because they invade her privacy too much.,1
When it's bad it's REALLY BAD. This show was crap when it first came on.,1
There are many episodes that I enjoyed.,1
"HE was real local. Yes, I'd love to see this on DVD. Of course, that was before the show hit.",1
"The plot flows well, and the atmosphere and tension are spot on.",1
was most unfortunate and ( apparently! ),1
"We will never know if this could have been a great series. Thank You. I think that "" Key West "" might do well as a DVD.",1
It was an excellent show and let die way before it's time. What a shame.,1
Keep the faith! Agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show. The singer was Bankie Banx - saw his name come up on the credits.,1
I hate reality television.,1
"One of its actors is Meg Tilly. I then read this entire thread of reviews. I am right now watching "" The Big Chill "" on DVD.",1
Thank you for memories of it. 'every time it would be yet again taken over by a baseball game broadcast.,1
Fisher Stevens... perfect. Wish they'd post the Hurricane one.,1
"This was post - modern television, a valiant attempt to visualize magical realism. But be not downhearted!",1
"On the contrary, I really liked it. Compared to this, Tarkovsky is a speed freak. < br / > < br / > Compared to this, Bela Tarr is MTV. But it was a chore. ).",1
anyway see it. Optimistic. WITH DEPTH!!!! MIND FOREPLAY. IT'S A MUSICAL!!! That's it! Weird.,1
"Underling this is a humorously wicked black streak. One night Billy gets locked in the movie studio. For me, the soft ending they decided to go with just didn't feel right. In the long run, it probably could have done without. It's just a great suspense builder and mostly everything clicks into place! That's when she stumbles across a woman being brutally murdered, while being filmed.",1
"Hope you like The Hole too. it's about a guy and a girl in an apartment complex. Not sure if the film would break down into a series of submissive gestures, I felt a little un - easy recommending it, but then I saw the ending. worth a look.",1
"An incommunicability that here is taken to the extreme limits. ! It does it displaying us the story of two persons living in this world, a man and a woman. by the musical digressions, only apparently meaningless, that speckle the movie.",1
One can take this piece as torture or as a therapy... < br / > < br / > The topic at the surface? And ask - why is it there? Or is there some more magic? Is it for the atmosphere of the movie.,1
"See this film. The final scene is extraordinary. A plumber attempts to locate the source of the problem, then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor.",1
"It ought to be a cult classic, if nothing else. < br / > < br / > The script is quite brilliant. Tsai's direction is simply beautiful. They're always effective and never tedious. Eventually, they die. < br / > < br / > The Hole is a film that begs to be seen. ).",1
"Things don't get any clearer after that as the lunar sequence turns out to be the dream of Alice, a troubled woman. Upon her arrival, she is surprised as the people she meets seem to already know her. Footprints certainly isn't your average run of the mill Giallo, and that's no bad thing. After several things go wrong for her, Alice decides to go to a mostly deserted former tourist spot named Garma.",1
Stunning visuals... OK...,1
"The only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel. Psychological thriller "" is the most appropriate description I can think of. The female protagonist, Alice Cespi, discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days.",1
Very smart. < br / > < br / > This movie was MUTE WITNESS.,1
"She also has no recollection of the last three days except for a torn photo of the Garma hotel she finds in her apartment. < br / > < br / > FOOTPRINTS is a classy case of "" Guaranteed 100 % Euro - weird "" but not for everyone. The locations mirror Alice's unstable state of mind ; the island of Garma, off - season, with it's Arabic influence and ancient ruins, is a lonely, almost mystical place unwilling to give up its secrets. Blurring the distinction between dream, reality, memory and movies, the disturbing story is beautifully photographed by Oscar - winner Vittorio Storaro with a pensive score by Nicola Piovani.",1
"Having watched FOOTSTEPS for myself now, I can see where that reviewer was coming from in that both films deal with the psychological meltdown of their female protagonist. ).",1
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! She can not explained how this has happened to anyone.,1
"It was so esoteric, & yet one of a handful of movies that remains with you for a long time. Or horror, or even suspense.",1
"As a viewer, you crave to help this poor woman understand the things that overcome her, but you simply can't. Footprints ( on the Moon "" ) is almost certainly the strangest, most convoluted and most atypical Giallo ever made. Meanwhile, even the poor girl's nights are restless as she has reoccurring dreams of astronauts hopping on the moon surface and an uncanny scientist called Dr. Blackman. "" Fans of tension - driven and stylish Italian cinema can't afford themselves to miss this film, really.",1
"A very insightful psychological thriller! But the all cast is a treat, as well! And Klaus Kinski in a surprisingly disturbing cameo!",1
Klaus Kinski's role is too small though. The plot takes some nice twists and it's really hard to figure out where it's heading.,1
"The only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel. Psychological thriller "" is the most appropriate description I can think of. The female protagonist, Alice Cespi, discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days.",1
Very atmospheric and effective. She spends the majority of the movie trying to make sense of her visions.,1
"It is infinitely more complex and intriguing than that. Don't be deterred by Force Video's synopsis on the back cover. ? The fact that Klaus Kinski is top billed, but is only in small parts of the film, means little to me. It relies on visuals and emotion, much like Bava's "" Lisa and the Devil "". ( Though several comments expressed disappointment in his rather limited screen time. )",1
"its worth it. if you get the chance, watch this film. a change from the b - grade movies he has been doing since the early 90's. this a haunting piece of work.",1
"The end is very sad, but beautiful.",1
"Should be required viewing for all film majors. He is mysterious, yet approachable. His words conjure familiar feelings and thoughts from the audience. Rutger is amazing.",1
He shows how affected he is by music and his disappointment when it goes away. Mattijn Hartemink is also effective in the flashback scenes as young Harry with a silent role. A very good effort.,1
< br / > < br / > See this film if you!,1
You better watch out fool. Do I have a booger hanging out of my nose? What are you staring at? Who knows?,1
"They loved it too. There, or near abouts. You'll love it!",1
"This is obviously something I can appreciate now that I'm 21 years old, but speaking from experience there is no way I would show to my kids!",1
"The kids playing Tom and Ella are good. In the Wizard it is "" We're off to see the wizard. "" No, these aren't blatant likenesses but hear me out.",1
"The 1978 adaptation had all the ingredients of a potentially wonderful film. 7 / 10 Bethany Cox. Hi - Cockallorum is an example of a song, that is like marmite, you either love it or hate it. It is based on an absolutely charming book by Charles Kingsley. All in all, certainly not a terrible film, but could have been better artistically. The voice cast is also commendable, especially Jon Pertwee, voicing charming characters in their own right.",1
The first I described above. This may be the most tension - filled movie I have ever seen. She plays a cute and wholesome makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker.,1
"In 1850 in Yorkshire, a boy chimney - sweep is falsely accused of theft by his crooked master and runs away. ! It really is two films in one, which somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole.",1
We watched that scene over and over. There should be more films like this. I LOVE it. It is questions like these that are just eating at me! ( But what is up with the gay seahorse??!! ),1
I hadn't been that excited ina long long time! < br / > < br / > Great classic kids film! And watching it back now the animation is terrible!,1
"Slip Slide Adventures. My only real gripe is a plot hole caused by a deleted scene. Let's hope a restored version appears in the near future. Ariadne "" is the water baby voiced by Samantha Gates. A. K. A.",1
"MAN, I love IMDb! My older sister vaguely remembers it. I can't seem to find it anywhere! Thanks!",1
It has a sweet sensitive story. Something children can appreciate.,1
He accepted that. I enjoyed animation. ( I really like him! ),1
"This film IS easy to get a hold of, try play. Its completely suitable for children of all ages! I read the above comment and cannot believe it!",1
"Personally, I love The Suite Life and I'm a big fan of Ashely Tisdale. When I first saw the ad for this, I was like'Oh here we go. All in all, a pretty good show. But he really annoys me.",1
"I just finished this movie and my only comment is "" OH! "".",1
All of the performers are great. !,1
< br / > < br / > Seriously. 9. And a mighty good director.,1
All in all I found this movie superb and so much alive thanks to Gary Cooper charis. All the actors are above average. The plot is quite elaborate and clear. City Streets is amazingly modern technically speaking for a movie made in 1931.,1
Brilliant acting helps too.,1
"He was just that beautiful. It's nice to see her in a role with a harder edge than many she was given - - so often she looks like she's afraid she's about to be hit by someone. < br / > < br / > There are lots of familiar faces in this film, including the wonderful Wynne Gibson.",1
"If you get the chance to see this little gangster flick, don't let the chance go by.",1
gritty look at New York City and dock workers.,1
"Enjoy! It showed up again on TV about six months ago. If you are a fan of film noir, this is a must see.",1
"He really goes out of his way to befriend the newcomer. However, its racial theme is ground - breaking for the time. Everything is done on seedy New York location, without the usual movie extras.",1
"Tyler, a black man, brings his friend out of his shell and introduces him to his family and a new girlfriend. < br / > < br / > At the end of the movie, we are left with mixed emotions.",1
rare gem.,1
"Not that it's subject is that controversial now anymore though. But on top of that, he also was a great actor.",1
This is a powerful film which seems to have never re - arisen after the Joe McCarthy censorship period. ).,1
"It's the story of a troubled man, Axel, who has a mysterious past that gradually comes out during the film. T. T. teases Charlie and gives as good as he gets. < br / > < br / > The film leaves open what happens to Axel. Whatever does, he's a different man now.",1
Call me sentimental. It is film worth watching over and over again. I highly recommend this one! I cry at a lot of movies.,1
< br / > < br / > He makes this movie breathe and alive. His acting is forceful and delicate and subtle at the same time.,1
I wish it were out on DVD or VHS. < br / > < br / > Catch this one if ever possible. And it's all hard earned money in that job. It's another story about the docks and the code of silence that rules it.,1
"< br / > < br / > "" Edge "" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. There are other ways that they could have shown this. Cassavettes, as Axel North, while very good, does not seem quite right for the part. Poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written.",1
"< br / > < br / > Cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows grit in his portrayal of a film. With the backdrop of tenements, the right mood is depicted in film. Am surprised that Montgomery Clift didn't get this part.",1
"He is at the bottom of the heap. I've been in fights like these myself, although no one got killed. John Cassavetes is on the run from the law. This is an anti racist film, which, at the time, was much needed.",1
"! Recommended highly!! in it, and she positively shines in this.",1
"Martin Ritt's first film offers an exceptional existentialist answer ( three years later ) to Elia Kazan's more conservative "" On The Waterfront. "" This film should be required viewing in high school or college history classes across the country, yet one can only find it on obscure late - night TV, if ever at all. Only most jaded viewers will not realize what a radical and entertaining film "" Edge of the City "" ends up being. < br / > < br / > What's most disturbing about this lost classic : how it sadly remains unavailable on any format, for reasons that remain quite cloudy.",1
7 / 10 They very quickly become good friends and Tommy does his best to help his friend.,1
"< br / > < br / > Playing Rockne, Pat O'Brien gives an impressive performance. Knute Rockne led an extraordinary life and his story is told rather well in Knute Rockne All American. It's unquestionably O'Brien's movie to carry and he makes the film and the character his own. It's a brilliantly - played scene, chock - full of emotion. Produced in 1940 the film may at times seem a touch dated and at times downright hokey. All makeup in the world wasn't going to make that believable and the effect is rather jarring. And the filmmakers do lay it on a bit thick at times as Rockne is glowingly and lovingly portrayed.",1
"Albert Basserman is Fr. The answer to both questions was simply, Notre Dame! He was a "" walk - on "" football player. ND is tops on both lists! Newland, Chemistry Prof and Rockne mentor. Yeah, love'em or hate'em, but you sure don't ignore, em. < br / Callaghan, C. S. C., Notre Dame President. Gail Page appears as the Mrs., Bonnie Skiles Rockne. It was about 10 years after that the film was released.",1
Enjoy.,1
But he is probably best known for his motivational locker room speeches. Pat O'Brien is incomparable in his role as Rockne. Do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version.,1
"He was an ambitious man who had a vision about how the game should be played. Luckily, he went to give his beloved Notre Dame the glory he was after. The result is a vibrant picture about the man responsible for the legacy of the collegian sport, Knute Rockne. Donald Crisp makes a good contribution as Father John Callahan who was Rockne's mentor at the university. In fact, he doesn't change much throughout the film, but he is fine as Mr. Rockne. """,1
< br / > < br / > Rockne knew how to work the media also. < br / > < br / > Rockne's first impact on football was as a player with Notre Dame not a coach. Those well publicized pep talks of his were not just to inspire his players.,1
"He is a coach for all seasons. ( Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn to be exact. ) < br / > < br / > He motivates his students. The film is great. From humble beginnings, Rockne entered Notre Dame as a student circa 1910.",1
It almost makes me a Fighting Irish devotee. They had some pretty wild plays back then with a lot of laterals. O'Brien is the only actor with a large role in here. This is one of them. < br / > < br / > What this film does nicely is balance the personal story with the football.,1
"Now available on DVD, it's kinda fun to see a comedy that would have cost $ 100 million to produce had it been made in 2004. The problem is that what DIDN'T end up on the cutting room floor probably should have!",1
< br / > < br / > I like the concept with the poetry and the fantasy. I watched the movie about 13 yrs ago while living in Airlie Beach Qld Australia. I still don't have it but will one day.,1
"The Beat was an exciting movie about a couple of young punks trying to survive in 1980's New York. Rex showed them the beauty in Rats, Disease and Murder. Rex showed them beauty in angry music.",1
Simply caring and friendship make things a bit better. Not your typical person meets inner city kids and saves them through knowledge film at all. It wasn't clean and polished but it was better than that. She refused to let me do it. I even tried to preform one scene for my high school drama class. But I love this film. Not only do characters get drawn into his world but you do too. < br / > < br / > The story was original.,1
"< br / > < br / > 9. He pulled it off brilliantly. It's in the mindset of a Dangerous Minds or a Substitute, but much better. Usually actors fail at that role. And they refrained from playing any really dateable 80's music. And his Mutant theory is, to my knowledge, original.",1
"Why? There is a SINCERITY in each of the actors'performances that makes the characters they play endearing. I won't spoil the revelation behind Rex's name, but please don't get too excited, O. K.? That said, the acting does NOT detract from the film.",1
"Milland is also excellent and very funny. Of all the major 30s star actresses, Miriam Hopkins has been the most bizarrely overlooked and underrated. Hopkins was famous for her dislike of Hollywood, and the results has been a bad rep - - undeserved.",1
"Inevitably, her true identity is discovered and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong with whom. Miriam Hopkins, one of the great 1930'- 1940's actresses is delightful in this film. They were endearingly precocious, and were really the jewels of the film. Honestly, though I am usually not remotely a fan of child actors, I really enjoyed the two young girls who played Susan's nieces.",1
"Hopkins is efficient but brittle, lacking the warmth and sexiness Rogers would have had. Even more refreshing are Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby playing the little girls. < br / > < br / > He also had the good sense to cast this movie properly.",1
"He also has a good beard. I bought this a while back, during a massive martial arts movie phase. All in all, I would recommend this to kung fu and general Hong Kong action fans.",1
"< br / > < br / > It reminds me a bit of Dick Van Dyke in "" Cold Turkey'where Van Dyke played the local minister. ( Used zoo animals anyone? ) will appreciate those scenes.",1
Not this movie! I am a huge fan of the $ 5.,1

This film is about landscape.,1
Sean.. who? But I must say I really liked his acting from this movie on. I knew Jason from other movies and of course Robin of Sherwood. Thank goodness not all Dutch people are that ruthless. It was really good!,1
"The relationship has become fairly strained, with Jason even threatening to change his name. < br / > < br / > And all this has nothing to do with being the son of Sean Connery.

Sally and Saint Anne is a very funny movie.,1

A nice good family film that came from an era when life was a bit more simpler.,1
"All - in - all, this is a satisfying movie experience. Too bad.",1
I loved it. This nice humour style is much missed these days. Its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh.,1
Daily again fleshes out a ballplayer in a completely satisfying manner. I heartily recommend Pride of St. Louis to baseball fans everywhere.,1
< br / > < br / > In the 1937 All Star Game Dizzy started for the National League. He was never same pitcher and his refusal to accept that is part of the story. Because of that Crenna isn't given much to work with. He'd broken a big toe and put too much of a strain on his arm. After all part of the Dean story is that early end to his career.,1
It was simple but somehow very addicting. ! Fred was such a great show.,1
"Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island! "" I don't think this could be funnier. is a hilarious show that is on Saturday mornings on WB.",1
I highly recommend this film to fans of the genre.,1
A £3.,1
"At another hand, I like the music in the film very much. I think this time Aaron ( JD ) has shows something real to us.",1
"Im a CELEBRIDEE!! "" Every one who i no who watched it loved it!",1
i loved it! !,1
notorious big budget flop when released.,1
"They watched it twice! This is a really cute movie. < br / > < br / > Sort of a gender reversed "" Notting Hill "" set in high school.",1
"There is something for everyone. A sequel would be cool. I kept thinking that I liked a lot of the people, and wonder if I will see them again? I think even my little half sister who is 6 could see this.",1
This guy is really talented... Time will tell... < br / > < br / > My advice to you?... I LOVED IT. Seriously... It's a very romantic film...,1
"This movie is so bad, it's actually good. Well, I have to say, this movie was probably the funniest movie I have seen all year. I would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for good laugh.",1
"Once you get over that, you can really start to enjoy it. I know it was mine, to be sure! Very well made film.",1
Problem is J. D. isn't good at math. !,1
com so e - mail me if you wanna. ! i so wish i could sing as good as he could. I LOVE YOU AARON CARTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
This film brought me to tears.,1
"Lou Pearlman and company have been known for over - exploiting their pop protégées, you remember Justin Timberlake's foray into TV movie Model Behavior? Where's the line? Like it or not Aaron has seen more success in his young life than most people could ever dream of having, so it only seemed natural for him to do a movie. The only reason Britney Spears'dribble Crossroads got a higher score is because she has boobs. Accept this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be.",1
"Yesterday I found it. The Old Fashion episode is priceless. One hated it, the other loved it.",1
"Rebel is a blind drag racer, who nearly runs down the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he is not using any headlights. The confrontation between Bond and Fox played by Richard Moir adds tension to story. It is not speed, reaction times that make a great racer.",1
"You actually start sympathising with the car! A genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars. ), this doesn't mean that the car isn't the main focus of this film. Whatever floats your... car, I guess. Car porn! There's no denying the importance of transport on cinema. And holy holy, are these cars something!",1
< br / > < br / > ( shes a 351 right? ),1
"You could get out if you wanted, but the shame of losing has taken you... BANG! Your car lights on fire.",1
But the following scene with the mum was cut. The main reason is that the film was shot widescreen ( 2. Cowards! The DVD is actually a reasonable version of the film. The latter had over 10 times the budget of ROE.,1
"Then this movie is for you!!!! Living dangerously, living fast and winning at any cost is their obsession. I really loved Fox's car the most which was a worked Dodge Charger. They don't turn back, the don't give.. and the don't ask for help. I remember watching this movie many years ago on VHS at a friends place. So of course I grabbed it while I could as it was the only copy there.",1
"Also there is a really cool song sung by Terry Serio the main actor. Yeah so the acting not the greatest - it was never made to win an oscar. This movie features 1 of Aussies greatest muscle cars, the XYGTHO. The car action will keep you comin back for more and more.",1
!,1
Could they make films like this in the West? It also provides food for thought.,1
"They were films loaded with atmosphere but short on actual horror. Uzumaki, to me, seems clearly influenced by these films. p. s. All the people criticizing the acting... pullleasse... in this genre?",1
VERY memorable comedy. It was just meant to be FUNNY and it is!,1
< br / > < br / > a It fails at being a competent horror movie.,1
"To be honest, I thought this movie would be a Japanese drama. The overall coloring of this picture makes for a somewhat demented story. It tells the story of a town that is cursed by the Uzumaki or The Spiral in English. I was dead wrong. It has just enough wackiness and insanity, it touched me. Sort of like atwisteddrama.",1
"I watched it for the first time last night and I was blown away. < br / > < br / > Simp stunning. This is, indeed, a "" Weird Tale "" par excellence.",1
"< br / > < br / > This may take a few viewings for it to sink in. During certain parts, was it just me or did you see vortex visual? A great trippy film.",1
"The most original film you will see... not just this year, but probably ever. Possibly as psychologically damaging as "" The Ring "". Recomded!",1
"My Rating : 7 / 10. Throughout my viewing, I felt like I was watching a cartoon.",1
It is a great horror film that is not actually scary or suspenseful but somehow... eerie. This is a great movie if you are looking for a looker with out too much substance or deeper meaning.,1
"Don't watch it as a horror film in the "" traditional "" western sense, but more like a Grimm's fairy tale.",1
"rather than to jolt. Why? A bizarre image. taking over you and trying to kill you, force you to kill others. Uzumaki prefers to creep and crawl ( like a snail might! ) I cringed and curled my toes.",1
The inept robbers are a hoot.,1
It also makes a good point.,1
"It uses it's wild style to tell a somewhat non - exist story. But, unfortunately, the story somewhat falls flat.",1
"I just saw this movie on the Sundance Channel, and it really is bizarre. But it looks like this is the first film for Kirie and Shuichi's portrayers. Wow.. She was also pretty in a classic kind of way. < br / > < br / > Very bizarre, but very imaginative and unique movie. < br / > < br / > The ending was odd. I must say, if they really are debuting here, they do a pretty good job.",1
).,1
"As with a lot of Japanese films though, the ending is the ending, and did anything get resolved? My favorite was the father with spinning eyeballs, personally. Hey now, I have never laid eyes on a Manga comic, but apparently this movie is based on one. Ah well, such is life. 8 out of 10 stars.",1
"Couple of other points, main girl is quite pretty and cute, and the song that plays at the end is good too. What it reminded me most of however was early Cronenberg ; films like Shivers and Videodrome. Sound silly? Firstly, the good stuff. I felt the pacing especially initially was a little slow. * SPOILERS * below. < br / > < br / > The acting wasn't great, but not too horrible either. Direction was top notch, sure a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and stylish. I rated it 7 / 10.",1
"This film reminds me of eerie indiana. Another great horror from Japan, get yourself a copy.",1
"There is a PLOT, it's just that it may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer. It'simultaneously provocative and fun.",1
"Despite of some hiious scenes, the overall tone of this film is pretty dark. "" Uzumaki "" is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is top - notch. They go nuts over vortexes and spirals. 7 out of 10.",1
"Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway, this captures JMV at the peak of his 70's performances. In the local café he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. Mr Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine'Raider'could still be so innocent.",1
That's not true in Japanese horror. This film shows it happening to several groups of people.,1
Hats off to Sekhar. He is underestimated in Indian film industry.,1
"Anand is one of those low - budget but well taken movies. However, it does have some massala of it's own. His father accidentally kills her parents in a car crash anyways, so why not pay her back?",1
"The beautiful lyrics by Veturi. ! < br / > < br / > 2. < br / > < br / > Cinematography, deserves a mention. < br / > < br / > This movie is great because it tries to be different, when all Telugu movies were composed of 6 songs and 4 fights.",1
And he starts making Roopa feel comfortable and secure. ! Kamalini mukherjee as Rupa has given a marvelous performance. Highly recommended! Anand as Raja has done well too.,1
I would recommend everyone see this documentary. See it if you get chance.,1
Through their reminiscences we glimpse two lives tragically cut short. Through the laughter and the tears ( and the sweat ) we see the power of hope and honor and love.,1
Some actors did great job. But Mikko Leppilampi was so lame.,1
!,1
The ending was also wonderful.,1
I have a feeling that Finland has only like five actors. I enjoyed it and Louhimes'directing was again very solid.,1
I have it on my list of ten favorite films of all time. It's an amazing piece of work.,1
"More so than Kaurismäki, to say least.",1
"Every emotion was captured brilliantly in the movie. The character development in the movie is first rate. First, during the sequence of one event leading to another I felt that the coincidences were too rapid and forced.",1
I would rate it a 7. This is a very good film. This film has very interesting and strong characters.,1
"I loved every minute of it! It'll have you laughing, crying and biting your lip.",1
8 / 10 Cold climate changes us. For Estoninans Finland sometimes seems like a land of dreams. The acting is great as well. Jasper Pääkkönnen has become one of the top Finnish stars.,1
Correct me if I'm wrong ). And a good one at portraying the point.,1
"Hola! Oh gods, I feel as tho I've just written a love letter to this film - but there it is.",1
The audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive. Character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth.,1
"That's what being in the Marine Corps and WWII did to him! Hedge incredibly floors the big cement headed buffoon knocking him out cold with one punch! """,1
"The best that Miguel Bardem has ever made. Well, he's the MAN.",1
"Miguel Alexandre, a veteran actor, is also good as Manco. He is an actor's actor. As Federico, he does what he does best.",1
"In fact, these are what make the film outstanding. I highly recommend it. < br / > < br / > Federico's only known weakness is Pilar ( Victoria Abril ), his former mistress and partner.",1
Would love to see it again. No idea why. Got hold of a short clip via BBC cult website.,1
To regard the film as nothing more than a documentary about skateboarding would fail to recognize several important aspects of Dogtown.,1
It just goes to show how much alike we all were during those wonderful days.,1
Soon came Skateboard Odyssey Mission Viejo. An indoor park with every scenario imaginable. They delivered.,1
"I think you should buy this movie if you are a skater. That led to Skateboardings first real start in Dogtown. They started it by skating in drained swimming pools. Soon, the Zepher Surf team was formed. That's just a bit of the story behind it. Even if you are not,UY! This movie was awesome.",1
"I don't know if I actually want to see the movie, but who knows. From that point on, I spent my free time trying to find the movie. Sean Penn does a great job of narrating the documentary.",1
This is a pretty good documentary.,1
"It's pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by Jan at such a young age. I wish this movie was available, cause I would love to see it again. I watched it at the time, and didn't get it. It wasn't until years later when I saw the movie and actually understood meaning of it.",1
The acting was great.,1
Does anyone know the story on that? I never knew that.,1
"Good, entertaining and accurate era - feel to most scenes. Right there. Old skatekey skatewheels were used on plywood cutouts to roll down sidewalk waves.",1
"While I This suddenly transformed into the film I wanted to see. I hate films about sports. I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. He was sincere ; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project. I wanted to know the men behind the myths. I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now.",1
"And I teared up, again. It still does. Brilliant.",1
"It also focuses on the history of skateboarding. The Zephyr Team originated from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards. Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of Santa Monica, California. The documentary stars the members of the Zephyr Team and is narrated by Sean Penn.",1
"Jay Adams, at the time of documentary, was serving time on drug related charges. With their low pivotal style, they embarked on a Larry Bertlemen influenced journey that would lead to countless successes and a couple failures. Most with a common theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as Riding Giants, Sk8 TV, The Bones Brigrades, and Lords of Dogtown. All of the original members except Jay Adams and Chris Cahill are still well and surfing / skating. Chris Cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in Mexico.",1
"< br / > < br / > from Andy Frye at MySportsComplex. com < br / > < br / > Dogtown puts chronological perspective into skateboarding, and the up - from - the - bootstraps history you never knew it had.",1
"Altman's prediction hasn't quite come true. I highly recommend "" Dogtown. Well, I wouldn't put such an expectation on Stacy Peralta, but he is a skateboarder who has made a good movie. This is all good. The whole effect is post - modern in the best sense, but that has been done.",1
A must see!,1
commercialism co - opts another kid birthed cultural node. few come out on top.,1
"Just saw Baby Blue Marine again after 30 years. If you're looking for action and adventure, the same applies.",1
"Marvelously narrated with delightfully easy'n'breezy nasal nonchalance by Sean Penn. The other dudes are very colorful and personable as well ; charismatic ball of cocky and defiant fire Tony Alva in particular comes across as one arrogant, yet impressive piece of furiously assertive work. The terrific rock soundtrack likewise seriously smokes.",1
"This film to me deserves a lot of praise, because even though I am not a surfer or skater, I remained inspired throughout the whole documentary. This resulted in a better picture to be drawn. As well as failures such as injury or burning out. Without the urge for them to retort to recent footage of the more famous surfers and skaters that remains popular today. < br / > < br / > The film explores areas such as the success, such accomplishing new tricks, winning competitions and gathering fame. < br / > < br / > Overall, truly outstanding effort.",1
"This is taking place in a not so nice area to live in. But the jury didn't now how to judge them. So they try something else. There were a couple of competitions and one national competition. skateboarding was a fact. At a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on. See you. < br / > < br / > In no time skateboarding was popular again. It started with the zephyr team, who where a fine group of surfers.",1
Kudos to Stacy Peralta for making beautiful piece of art! I thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as I remembered it in the 70's. It was THEIR opinion of their skating that mattered..... not yours or mine. Whenever it comes on cable I can't change the channel.,1
"The footage is brilliant. That's feeling this film gave me. This is a film that will appeal to people whether they like skating or not. It was a piece of junk, complete with clay wheels and everything. I remember when skateboarding had it's rebirth in the 70s.",1
"Love those knee high striped sport socks, you rock Tony! Buy the DVD, you won't regret.",1
"Otherwise, it probably won't have the impact on you as it did me. I have seen this movie twice now on cable. JOB WEL DONE!",1
"Let me say first of all that I spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before I realized I was totally uncoordinated. I'm sure it's at least a tad biased, but aren't all documentaries? Worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or, as in my case, anyone who grew up in the 1970 '.",1
"The soundtrack, not surprisingly, was good as well. This film is often guilty, so if you are so afflicted, be warned. I also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up better off for experience. < br / > < br / > Seen on 5 / 11 / 2002.",1
"They had "" attitude "" in spades.",1
Yep.,1
"Just a person on a board, doing it because they love to do it. But it tends to focus more on what is at the core of skating.",1
"But I never forgot. I cannot watch this film enough. It is long gone, and on the ash heap of my personal life.",1
"In their day and time, this was all new. A good surfer makes it look like there is nothing else but that wave right there, and the way you interact with it. radical. Ramps, downgrades, low sweeping curves while interacting with the cement waves beneath their feet. At one with the forces of nature. < br / > < br / > But I have always admired the X - games types and surfers especially.",1
"Anyone looking to learn more about the development of skateboarding should find Dogtown and Z - Boys adequate research material. < br / > < br / > It's a great documentary in the way that it is put together, though Stacey Peralta always knew Because Dogtown got all the attention, they were able to push skating to the next step.",1
"In addition, the fact that the war was fake led me to feel that the emotion was not real. I have heard so much hype about this movie but I came to find it lacking.",1
"8 / 10. Do these two give bad performances? Well, the film is too bleak for its own good.",1
"In most movies, they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched. BRAVO! But, an interesting insight into human nature. It came as no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and draining movie. < br / > < br / > Fun to watch, NO FREAKING WAY! < br / > < br / > PS - - 1 thing I LOVED about this film is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche. After all, it's all about the impact of war on civilians AND it's by the "" king of depression "", Ingmar Bergman.",1
"The film has powerful message and is a good film. I just probably would have liked it more having not seen some of those other Bergman masterpieces. Shame, is a Swedish film in Swedish with English subtitles. They live on an island working as farmers.",1
A must see. < br / > < br / > It is set in wartime and the heros are caught in the middle.,1
"Right! The acting was very well done. < br / > < br / > As you can plainly see, the cast is pretty big. Not a single cast member left me disappointed. If you're a fan of Gary & Wyatt in Weird Science, you'll immediately fall in love with the geeks.",1
"This is a harrowing movie, and it moves relentlessly.",1
"As such, it has to rank with Wild Strawberries as one of his greatest films, as well as one of his best screenplays, if not the best. These include quotes from Hitler to Vietnam Era American military figures.",1
"Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow give painfully detailed performances in this spare, stark drama. We see the way the external pressures of the war complicate and corrode their relationship. < br / > < br / > Shame represents a high point in the career of a master.",1
"Although the storyline itself was not too impressive, the content of film was. The absence of color and sound ( as in a soundtrack ) helps to give the film a more realistic feeling. Everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality. He depicted the harsh and unsettling events and effects of war.",1
"< br / Now they live in a weathered farm house on an island. Her husband Von Sydow shrugs off that war will pass them by. They are not reclusive intellectuals, either. It doesn't care what war it is.",1
"As an emotional film it is touching but never fully moving. As an intellectual exercise the film is top notch, this is a film that will make you think. Raging off in the distance is a war they know only from news reports. "". I am not a "" fan "".",1
The story began with an ordinary couple who fights and make up. Very well done movie.,1
"This film must seen. I felt devastated and, somehow unreal, as if I didn't exist.",1
"What Bergman has got here is "" What if all that bad stuff happened here in Sweden, to nice people like us? "" They are the ultimate in "" Not in my backyard "". The victimized couple are named Rosenberg. < br / > < br / > The first half plays like a black comedy. As in a modern short story, it's done in the abstract, with no real names, cities, or countries used.",1
"Great costumes! Loved this movie! Love the script. oh, loved the "" making - of "" too! Love the idea. Love the characters.",1
"5 / 10 This is one of the bleakest, the most harrowing of Bergman's films I've seen.",1
My vote is nine. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow have top - notch performances as usual and I don't recall seeing the breast of Liv Ullmann in any other movie.,1
"An excellent Bergman. < br / > < br > < br / > < br / > But I definitely don't regret to have gone on watching it. I watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago. I didn't know what to expect precisely, and for the first ten minutes I feared I might not enjoy this film.",1
"His religious themes this time is kept very low key, even as idea of keeping a sort of faith pervades the film's atmosphere. Needless to say this is not one of the easier films to go through in terms of Bergman's filmography, however for some it may be one of his more accessible works. Ingmar Bergman, in the midst of his prime, and following two other heavily psychological films, Persona and Hour of the Wolf, is far more interested in seeing what the effect of war has on usually civilized beings, that it brings out the worst in them, and also in a cathartic way is a reminder of what is truly crucial in living. < br / > < br / > And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eva is corresponded successfully with the backdrop of a chaotic kind of war - ground where the lines are never too surely drawn. When there is war action it's shot in unconventional, quick ways ( via great amigo Sven Nykvist ).",1
"A gruelling watch, but one of Bergman's finest films. The flaws become all that is left as his humanity is gradually eroded by one horror after another.",1
"But what about war? Jan is at first an idealist, unable to react properly to the world and a subject to his wife's will. In Skammen that idea is extended to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. This creates a huge tension and makes every event meaningful.",1
"Nor is this a romanticisation of war or patriotism, unlike most war movies. Through much of the film they are spectators, much as we are. < br / > < br / > Highly recommended. 10 / 10 Bergman's Skammen is one of the most realistic depictions of war ever set to film.",1
"The film is not grounded in place or time, but rather in emotion. Both will lose a measure of humanity, but one to a greater degree than the other. A unique and effective war film, unlike any other. The pair could be anyone.",1
"< br / > < br / > The story is good. Good locations, good filming.",1
From the 80'outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone I just couldn't get enough! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. is one of the most fun and enjoyable low - budget films I've seen in quite some time. STMD!,1
"Jack White, in particular, has long straggly hair and a pale rocker's complexion that look completely out of place with the setting. It's a pity that in "" The Other Boleyn Girl "" she's so inadequate.",1
An honourable attempt that doesn't quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless.,1
the supporting cast. and it works. it's more of a romance / drama. mainly because of the performances.,1
"It is a shorter film, which is a plus for people with less patience. The primary plot differences are that Nicole Kidman's character is not married, Jude Law's is a deserter, and the conflict is the American Civil War. Comparing the two movies, the premise is quite similar. Amazingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. The Civil War sequences are absolutely great ; they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and dehumanizing.",1
"One of the best films I've seen and an invitation to one of greatest novels of the last ten years. < br / > < br / > Astounding scope, beautiful words, great acting and great music. Here's how.",1
The locations are beautiful and Minghella has an eye for a good shot.,1
Michele Pfieffer in her younger days could have played the part perfectly. < br / > < br / > Romantic epics need a convincing heroine. Ray Winstone was excellent as the London / Southern villain. Kidman was also too old to play the ingénue and Law's love interest. Even Natalie Portman would have been an improvement.,1
It was the most romantic kiss I've ever seen in a film. I just saw the DVD and loved it.,1
"< br / > < br / > This film isn't of epic stature, but it turns out i was relieved it wasn't.",1
"'Farm owners instead of plantation owners. < br / > < br / > I thought all the acting was very well done, with Zellweger the best. Now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials. She deserved the credit she got for it. Even the love story was opposite. I think that was true. I thought she played the part of the hillbilly girl very well. I like to be surprised by next scene, not know what is going to happen before it does. She still did a good job, I just thought the other two were better.",1
"It's supposed to. Gratuitous nudity. Sound familiar? If you like slashers, you'll really appreciate this film. Zero budget. "" It's a lot of fun. There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. The script was very well written, and dialogue flowed naturally.",1
I have not managed to completely block out this film from memory even though it has been two years since I've seen it. < br / > < br / > The blonde albino character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since I saw the film. I cried for about two hours straight after wards.,1
"My vote is nine. < br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) :'Cold Mountain I liked this film a lot. The story alternates present and past situations, disclosing a beautiful romance.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film surfs through genres as needed - never presenting a dull moment. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. Inman's experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image. It is a romance, a war story, an action - adventure and historical fiction, all nicely woven into one. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. As this young romance begins to bud, Inman enlists in the confederate army, taking with him a book Ada has given him and a photograph of her.",1
"It seemed to apply to all times. They didn't take focus, but added to the whole effect. A heart - wrenching story about humanity and war.",1
"Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived. < br / > < br / > Then again, calling Cold Mountain "" a war movie is not entirely accurate.",1
I highly recommend K - PAX. 8 / 10,1
< br / > < br / > good film that will get you talking with your friends.,1
"that happens quite unspectacular and rather unrecognized, but we're dealing with a movie here, right? so prot's hospitalization is just a trigger to the plot. catch a beam of light. they made me think and philosophize for hours already. now. stunning quotes.",1
The edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims. Hey I never said this show was tasteful did I? Cue the child ` s frightened screams. Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if they ` re classed as obscene.,1
A resounding cry of Kevin?,1
Is Prot an alien or just a crazy bugger? < br / > < br / > A solid 85 %.,1
Think.,1
"< br / > < br / > Enjoy this film, I did.. I always liked David Lynch and Cronenberg.",1
I thought this movie was highly underrated. Once it did end....,1
"As far as "" violent images "" go, we don't see too much. Bridges is also excellent in his part. The wife of Dr. Powell is Rachel Powell, played by Mary McCormack. A techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes K - PAX sound sci - fi and makes certain scenes intriguing. < br / > < br / > This movie doesn't really fall into any particular genre.",1
< br / > < br / > Most highly recommended.,1
5 of 10,1
"Was in serious doubt about renting the DVD or not. Inteligent, funny, original, touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat through the whole movie. 10 out of 10 Just watched this and it was amazing. The script is one of the best ever. < br / > < br / > Also the acting is great ( one of Kevin Spacey's best roles ). Enjoy! I can't really find anything...... The visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well - chosen.",1
"So Prot takes over the thinking of Robert, taking over his body so to speak. This is my interpretation and theory, and I believe it is very sound. < br / > < br / > First, here is the plot. One of the patients is missing and is never found again. Prot is from the planet K - Pax. In fact, he tells them he can take one person back with him. Prot and Robert became best friends.",1

at least for me. years. perfect'till the end.,1
"< br / > < br / > To me, this movie felt really uplifting and yet depressing in the end. If you have enjoyed the Butterfly Effect, Donnie Darko or The Machinist, you will enjoy K - Pax too. < br / > < br / > Go on, and enjoy. Spacey delivers a great performance as Prot.",1
The always delightful Kevin Spacey makes us once again question certain truths in our lives.,1
Listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and end as they truly touch on concepts not commonly presented in western philosophies. < br / > < br / > 9 of out 10 rating - Superb - with nominal room for improvement.,1
There is a whole other cast of excellent actors ( like Saul Williams'convincing performance as Ernie ) who make this film truly work.,1
"On July 27, Prot later reveals, he will depart again for K - PAX, and he can only take one human with him. When asked why he believes he has been institutionalised, he matter - of - factly replies that it is because "" you think I'm crazy. "" < br / > < br / > Prot's manner is courteous and cooperative. Of what will actually happen on that date, nobody is certain.",1
"If you still didn t watch it, go right now!",1
"I instantly became a fan of Kevin Spacey, also.",1
"Great movie! It's part of what makes the movie so great. And that's exactly what this movie is! """,1
The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program. The 2001 Brass Eye Special. Morris never attempts to do either such thing. Retards.,1
"After seeing the movie, I was blown away. Needless to say, I loved it. I had no idea what to think. The DVD is usually in the bargain bin, pick it up! / 10 How this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year's Oscars is beyond me.",1
K - PAX is exactly what a heart warming film should be.,1
"And he has to know. Softley creates But it's Powell's job, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. Who is to say what exists or what is possible?",1
"< br / > < br / > This is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer. I rated it a 9 / 10. K - Pax is a very intriguing film. Spacey is so believable as both alien and human, it makes the viewer's task that much more difficult. Is Prot ( Kevin Spacey ) really an alien, or is he a mentally deranged human who just thinks he is an alien? '< br / > < br / > Kevin Spacey once again delivers a marvelous performance as Prot.",1
I knew nothing about the history of the series. I got this as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 DVDs. < br / > < br / > Spoilers here. Does anyone have any information on this?,1
Needless to say I made sure I saw all the other episodes. All other cast members do a stellar job too.,1
"It was rated R because of the nudeness, sex and gore. A mixture of Alien and Ghost Busters?",1
"As a bit of cheesy entertainment for SF buffs, it's got a lot of merit. < br / > < br / > In short : it's fun.",1
The film really shines in these scenes. Lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes. The U. S. version of lifeforce moves much faster ( the editing on the DVD version is terrible. < br / > < br / > I love this film. Much better in the U. S. version. It just doesn't belong in the movie. version. I was floored when I saw this.,1
Story was good.,1
There's plenty of gore effects to keep genres fans happy. Tobe Hooper was the man. She's one smoking hot number. < br / > < br / > Highest Recommendation!,1
both had mixed male / female crews - - the legend of Halley's comet and disaster continues! One great similarity ( and this is always bad luck! ) < br / > < br / > I just wish Mathilda May would drain her victims through another part of body! Something I think some people miss about great science fiction is that it predicts some part of the future.,1
"< br / > < br / > Not to be over - looked. The effects ( done by ILM ) still hold up by todays standards. Based on the book "" Space Vampires "" by Colin Wilson.",1
The story was WAY cool.,1
"By far one of the best sci - fi films out there. It does have some moments you wish would hurry up and pass by, but they are few and far between.",1
"I assume the males souls also went up the ship, but not shown. It seems they don't have carnal sex, like vampires of legend. It was also a beautiful love story. < br / > < br / > What about all the humans killed? Enough to re - energize those hexagon cells and create new bat creatures. The beginning and end were ethereal. So what? In other words, all the human souls that went to the ship could be re - incarnated as bat creatures. Bizarre is an art form.",1
"Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in "" Beware, My Lovely, "" a 1952 film from RKO. It isn't clear whether or not he's the killer, since he seems surprised to see the body. The tension builds to a very high level and ends in a way you'not expecting.",1
No. Is it a perfect movie?,1
"A naked girl can ` t escape from here "" Can ` t she? And talking of the script it must be one of the most uneven in cinema history, it ` s though it was written in chapters by several different people. When mentioning LIFEFORCE in conversation with males it ` s always a race to say "" Seen alien in LIFEFORCE?",1
"To the guy who hatched the idea for Lifeforce I have one thing to say : Thank you, sir! Well, to make a long story short, they're "" space vampires ""... naked "" space vampires. "" God bless you, all of you who were involved. < br / > < br / > Wow. The Col. wings it back to our big blue ball in an escape pod. MINOR SPOILER : Yes.",1

"< br / > < br / > It's not a good movie. No. < br / > < br / > Now, do I think it's successful? No, "" Lifeforce "" is not a great movie. < br / > < br / > To be honest, the movie is eye candy and fun to watch.",1
"Thirty days later & back on Earth the Churchill is detected on radar, a rescue mission is sent up only to discover the spaceship is burnt out & all the crew supposedly dead.",1
"It's flamboyant and spirited entertainment. "" Lifeforce "" is a truly bizarre adaptation of the novel "" The Space Vampires "" by Colin Wilson, scripted by Dan O'Bannon & Don Jakoby. Big mistake.",1
LIFEFORCE was one of Cannon Films'biggest flops. We got zombies! Perhaps then you'll understand.,1
"Danny Boyle was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the clappers. ). Plus it offers space vampire Mathilda May, the best thing to come out of France since Simone Simon, spending the entire movie naked.",1
"Railsback finally catches up with May, and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal sabre. The aliens are bought back to Earth... and that's where the incredible happens.",1
A must see. Some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time. < br / > < br / > Rating : 4 stars out of 5. He starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar.,1
"Like several other reviewers here, I'm surprised to see many negative reviews on this film. The Terror from Beyond Space'( 1958 ) - the immediate sources for'Alien'( 1979 ).",1

Daisy Movie Review By James Mudge From beyondhollywood.,1
"But, all of a sudden, she has a secret admirer. A young Korean artist lives in Amsterdam. This second gentleman, too, has a secret ; he is an Interpol agent. How will this shadowy love triangle play out? Costumes are very fetching and the production values, high. This is a beautiful picture to watch.",1
"Amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions! I saw the Korean version of Daisy first. Another erased there. < br / > < br / > Then I got the DC and watched it. 2 seconds chopped off here. The endings of both versions leave room for interpretation. I think this is the first REAL director's cut I've ever seen. An entire scene added here. Same movie, but different feel. Wow!",1
"< br / > < br / > Hye - young is in love with this mysterious stranger. One a professional hit - man eking out a living, the other an Interpol agent. Nonetheless, she's terribly moved, and touched by this sole act. Flowers!",1
). Good to see I'm not the only person who remembers this great film.,1
I have been trying to find what it was and finally today i did!,1
"This film has "" haunted "" me since I saw it when I was about 8 years old. I've certainly never forgotten it, even though I couldn't find it anywhere.",1
"Its also a bit odd that the ghost chooses boy to help the trapped adults, and not just help the trapped adults direct. 'or'don't be prejudiced against ghosts!') There wasn't even a greed / capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine. I was dying to see how it lived up to my memories. Oh well.",1
"- It means the loss of our free will, due to our unpremeditated deeds. This film is one of those that can't be regarded by its outwardness. And... what's the "" right thing ""?",1
!,1
< br / > < br / > The cinematography is just wonderful. Beautiful Brighton in 1937! He gives a restrained but compelling performance as the patriarch of the family.,1
I love this movie.,1
One of my favorite movies. Get away from the made - for - TV Broadway Bo. An exact mixture of character and story. Read the quotes.,1
"There are also dramatic elements ( some work, some are overkill ) that lend some weight to the story.",1
"< br / > < br / > Helen is justifiably terrified, however. Howard doesn't know and neither do we. He is remarkably powerless - can't fight, can't work, can't make love. I think I'll go home "". And, he does a woman'job - "" Floor's are my speciality "". Frankly, I don't think he's a psychopath.",1
"I guarantee it ( no money back, though ).",1
I recommend this movie. That scene was Oscar worthy.,1
"Rent this little gem, you won't sorry!",1
"In April 1947, New York City faced an epidemic crisis. Reed Hadley's narration sounds as though it was plucked straight from a newsreel, reciting facts as if reading off the official police transcript.",1
And that's not an idle threat given the situation. Evelyn who smuggled some stolen jewels into the country from Cuba also smuggled in smallpox. < br / > < br / > Evelyn's on a mission also.,1
"Having smuggled $ 50, 000. The first half of "" The Killer that stalked New York "" is a crime suspense / drama with the U. A killer that's as old, or even older, then man himself.",1
Noir indeed. This is a really dark movie. Don't be put off.,1
A good flick! Eventually she is pursued and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs.,1
"No egos here. These folks were happy to get the work. Anyway, it was pretty effective. Some might say that Richard Widmark and Jack Palance did it better in Panic in the Streets, but I disagree. Everybody gets hassled. Rough, grainy, edgy. Or maybe they just skipped the make - up and hair altogether. And the cast.",1
Can it get more unreal? Stinger has all qualities of a B - film horror movie. I would recommend seeing it if you like this type of films.,1
But how do we know? 9 / 10. What is this man capable of?. At first Lupino tries to help him. She is a war widow. There are some scenes with O. The suspense builds.,1
"I might have fast forward some minutes here and there... If you are not to care about the CG or special effects, this movie is great. I think this movie was made as good as it could have been.",1
"< br / > < br / > I am so glad that I did. Fans of any of these movies will, am sure, also love The Mascot. It was really incredible! < br / > < br / > This film precedes, but reminds me a lot of Mad Monster Party?",1
The Mascot is Ladislaw Starewicz's masterpiece. The dog gets picked with other toys to be sold off.,1
"For that matter, so is "" Vampyr "". "" We need to put something on there that won't cost much money. Dude B : "" Not to worry. The plot comes through in the dialogue. This film, "" The Mascot "" is criminally neglected in its current form.",1
Twigss and newspaper shreds come to life. Characters come flying from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses. New puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil's club scene. The Mascot features new techniques I have not yet seen in Starewicz's films.,1
"One bit. Now, think "" Toy Story "", circa 1934. Meaning, NO, your kids won't like it. < br / > < br / > Think "" Toy Story "". Somehow, "" The Mascot "" delivers.",1
It'a shame that more people haven't seen this gem.,1
"Anyone with the slightest interest in animation should give it a look. every toy is so detailed and very expressive that without words one can understand their motives. One day, his maker takes him away to sell him, and the adventure begins as he tries to find his way back home.",1
This film must be seen to be believed! archive.,1
His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase. It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons Lupino in her home for about a day. It was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway and it starred Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. For whatever reason RKO thought to eliminate the age difference. The film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference.,1
And what characters? !,1
"If you have not seen it, see it. Enjoy! Strange people.",1
A great movie.,1
If only more people understood danish... This is actually a brilliant movie.,1
"One that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath, what are his motivations to what he does. Oh! There's really something missing in their brains!",1
This movie will be added to the short list. My sides hurt.,1
It builds on the atmosphere.,1
Send them to the freezer.,1
"7 / 10 One that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist. With one involving Christmas tree baubles immensely memorable. It's clear from the get go that Ryan's Howard Wilton is a dangerously troubled man, but this is a different sort of "" peril "" movie. For fans of Robert Ryan tho, it's something of an essential viewing, oh yes, and then some.",1
"8 out of 10. And Bjarne has a love interest too in Astrid, who works at the cemetery.",1
"Not entirely sure how I stumbled upon this movie, but I'm so glad I did. There are so many great one - liners in this film it puts American sitcoms to shame.",1
< br / > < br / > A must mention is the characters created and the actors making them believable.,1
"THE GREEN BUTCHERS ( Anders Thomas Jensen - Denmark 2003 ). The other performances are just as wonderful with every character in town refreshingly off - the - hook with some truly wonderful vignettes. When watching film, I never even realized it was the same actor. Kaas actually plays a double role, also playing his comatose twin brother Eigil.",1
Nobody in this movie are amused. < br / > < br / > 9 out of 10.,1
"It is not boring, nor is it too dramatic. < br / > < br / > More lines.",1
"Many Americans are lazy, and this has manifested itself even in our DVD - watching. The character depth derived in this film is AMAZING. PLEASE check this movie out!",1
"All at once every person in the village wants to taste that incredible "" chicken "". Personally I liked it lot. One of the butchers locks the electrician into the freezing chamber when he closes the shop. It's an incredible success. < br / > < br / > Than a tragic accident happens. The same for the humor. < br / > < br / > Next to the original subject, I was also pleased by the actors'performances and the humor. Their shop is expensive and it doesn't even have electricity all over the place.",1
2 ) not to be so afraid.,1
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.,1
The game is set somewhere in the middle of the'90 in the spooky mysterious mansion.,1
The game is a FPS / Adventure game hybrid. < br / > < br / > One main strength of the game is the mood.,1
"I used Dosbox and was able to play the game quite well. This game is an action / adventure with combat. maybe Ebay. I thought it was a great game. The whole game is a quest. Its had to find now. Oh, and acting is very good too.",1
"And there are plenty of gaming areas. There are tons of different monsters so you never get bored. The puzzles are great, not too hard, not too easy. Pick this game up cheap and have some fun. It'nice and creepy.",1
"Nevertheless, Taylor is bright - eyed and enthusiastic, and she works well with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a child - star.",1
"we take great exception to it. < br / > < br / > So please, all you lovely Americans, don't confuse Ireland with England, ever! Like many other places roads and buildings have been built on hills and beaches. Like confusing Texas with Coney Island. No such scene exists now unfortunately.",1
Wow! If you're children love animals I strongly suggest you show it to them! I might just go away now and put it on! A lovely and nostalgic film.,1
Very cute and happy movie. The boy lover!,1
"This is one of his finest performances. This was one of my daughter's favorite films. I won't say anymore about the plot less I spoil it for first - time viewers. I, too, believe that everyone should have a chance at a breathtaking piece of folly once in his life. "" She lives with a big loving family in a small coastal village.",1
"My favorite scene is with Ryan and bratty teenager Margaret Whiting. It's a nail - biter all the way. It'a riveting scene, expertly done. Too bad.",1
< br / > < br / > This is far from a perfect movie. We believe in the characters and are moved by their story. The characters have depth and grow throughout the story. Mickey Rooney gives a beautifully nuanced performance of the trainer.,1
And it'another early color picture to boot!,1
High recommend this film.,1
Boy am I glad I bought it!,1
National Velvet is a great film.,1
"- Not to worry, she'd be back within a half hour ; it was Saturday! Mickey Rooney is the newly orphaned drifter, looking to tie himself over until he can follow his own dreams.",1
"They are supported very well by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp ( as Mr. and Mrs. Brown ). Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's strained siblings. A sentimental classic. Still, the characters'connection to horses, and to Ms. Revere's character are nicely conceived.",1
< br / > < br / > this movie has great spirit and a beloved cherished classic. it's a beautiful film.,1
! Ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures.,1
"Overall, the film is very entertaining. Recomded.",1
< br / > < br / > One side note. The photography is stunning. Fine storyline and top notch acting.,1
"She is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years. < br / > < br / > Anne Revere, in the part of Velvet's mother, actually won an Oscar for her performance. The film is indeed one that will appeal to the entire family, not just attention - addled youngsters.",1
"The content of the film plot is good for all ages, good will and behavior. It is good to remember it.",1
"The Good Book says you have to have faith like a child and she has it to spare. National Velvet also won one other Academy Award, for Film Editing. That scene is probably what won her the Oscar. < br / > < < br / > < br / > Elizabeth Taylor was so sweet and innocent in National Velvet.",1
< br / > < br / > What movie! A time when people were given the benefit of the doubt. This film shows all of that and more.,1
A must for every family video collection.,1
It's almost magical how'mom and apple pie'the movies were back then. It was never about sex... it's about coming of age! And My answer to his question is an unequivocal YES!!!! ( The other being'The Wizard of Oz. ) Now we have it on DVD. < br / > < br / > National Velvet'was one of my two favorite movies as a child. The movie going world was that trusting in the 40's.,1
The beautiful landscapes. It was filmed in England in 1944.,1
"Donald Crisp is terrif as Liz's gruff father and Angela Lansbury is a delight as her older, boy - crazy sister. A sentimental, heart - tugging family film set in England of the 1920s.",1
4 - - it's a lot better than that! And wow did Ryan do a really good job portraying this man!,1
"There was adequate suspense, and I believe the violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer. I saw this 1997 movie because I am a fan of Lorenzo Lamas ( and of his father, the late Fernando Lamas ).",1
"I, for one, miss them. But this is a serious movie. You're going to the MOVIES!",1
< br / > < br / > An exceptional experience 10 / 10,1
It definitely set mood perfectly. Music can sometimes make or break a film. Very nice choice! I absolutely loved this film...,1
"< br / > < br / > As I said, this is a controversial film.",1
Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate as the two lovers. I feel this short should be expanded into a feature film.,1
"The beauty of the film is also skin deep. The acting is superb. The dialog is so,'real '. And the ending made me love it more! Most go'that's it?",1
"< br / > < br / > I can't think of a better way to spend a spare 12 minutes. I watched this short moments ago on the Sundance Film Festival website, and I must say it is absolutely astounding.",1
"Improbable, but satisfying suburban melodrama.",1
The Youth In Us is a pitch - perfect gem. The story took me on a profoundly transforming journey.,1
"Nothing can replace Joseph Conrad's original work however. The acting also brought the characters to life through the mannerisms, voices, and personalities. Overall I gave this movie a seven out of ten. If you have read the novel, I recommend that you also view this movie. Joseph Conrad's timeless novel, Heart of Darkness, was depicted in the 1994 movie.",1
"Marlow is then led to Kurtz's station home. This movie is full of action and adventure. There, he sees many maps and pictures that Kurtz has painted. < br / > < br / > Marlow sets out on a steamer to Africa.",1
"In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast. his performance, as awarded, was stunning.",1
"My tip, read the book, and keep it that way, there are better movies out there. But as far as an unadaptable book has been adapted, it is of good standard. The references to Ancient Egypt were thoughtfully inserted.",1
< br / > < br / > This episode was all over place. A little disappointing this episode.,1
My vote is eight.,1
* * * out of 4.,1
"My vote is ten. You like "" Lost "", you have to watch it. The episode is entertaining, smart, and perky. < br / > < br / > "" Confirmed Dead "" is full of gripping action and greatly written dialogues. And here they are.",1
"The audience finds out early on that Ryan is a mad killer, but it takes Lupino much longer. He is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure. Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win Ryan over, to little avail. < br / > < br / > As a study in mental illness the movie isn't too impressive.",1
The movie was good. Really the only reason I watched it was Alan Rickman.,1
"I'll go make popcorn. "" It doesn't have that part.",1
Gug is remarkable.,1
But not too hip.,1
It'definitely worth checking out.,1
I am secretly in love with you but I have a hard time showing it. Did I skip anything? One treat : < br / > < br / > Agent Hawkins : So fill me in. A kidnapping and a woman shot in the process. These two make an outstanding pair as they work together.,1
I first saw this as a kid ( THE LITTLE RASCALS first went on TV the year I was born ) and fairly recently bought this on DVD. It always escapes me why she was never credited? I think Roach and McGowan would have been beaten to death if they'd tried to do that now.,1
!,1
< br / > < br / > GREAT CAST! Alan Rickman is very funny as the antagonist of gang.,1
And the ending is PERFECT. This movie deserves five stars. I give it a ten on your scale.,1
I thought rocked. Go Coco!,1
TOO Quirky? John Dahl?,1
!,1
"Very, very good. Quality film, excellent.",1
I want her to bear my children. They work well as a pair. This one was another totally unexpected gem.,1
I'd be curious to know what the budget was. this one has it all. And it got it in France!,1
"9 out of 10. Buster Keaton's brother Harry is at the receiving end of one of pies. "" Very funny and an early Gang talkie classic.",1
"Carla Gugino literally melts the screen in this crime caper. I disagree. The ending is perfectly sinister and you never see it coming. I cannot even describe it. But the film has so many "" other "" things to make it almost a modern classic. Great chemistry.",1
The actors are really good!,1
I'd love to know. Enjoy to one's plastic hearts content. ( spoilers? ) Franke rocks.,1
But it's very grossly entertaining and scary. And that one was okay not as good as the first one.,1
"If you watch it with that in mind, it turns into a really good film. !",1
"It'possible, but difficult. A really great movie with a lot of talented actors.",1
"It has some really good plot twists too, and the effects are extremely well done, plus the ending is great. < br / > < br / > The Acting is very solid!. The Direction is great!. This is a great German slasher, that's often quite suspenseful, and creative, with a fun story and solid performances.",1
"I was going to use'The German Scream'as a summary but that was already taken lol. Provided you're not alien to reading subtitles, Anatomy fits in snugly with the Scream / Urban Legend pack. It sums up Anatomy nicely. Her central performance as Paula is a great foundation for the movie to build from. Cue one plucky student investigating herself and uncovering a giant conspiracy. The spooky lecturers and their teachers pets are equally good, a truly foreboding presence at all times. < br / > < br / > Hats off to the actors involved as well.",1
This is one I think most could enjoy. < br / > < br / > The movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness.,1
He loved it! Both movies are awesome as intellectual horror films!,1
I laughed at it though.,1
A character falls into places and feels misconstrue.,1
< br / > < br / > It as what all those films don't. Surpassing all the modern American efforts at slasher films.,1
"< br / > < br / > Steven Ruzowillzky makes a fair effort of the script and the direction, but pushes no boundaries other than the general theme. < br / > < br / > An entertaining film, and an interesting chance to see how foreign filmmakers have been influenced by post - scream'horror'culture.",1
"Even more refreshing was a likable heroine who fights back when the bad guys go after her. I give this 7. Regardless this is a well done, scary and excellent thriller. I saw ( unfortunately ) the dubbed version on Encore. The ( mild ) nudity was, in a refreshing twist, male!",1
"This movie was an out - lash to that. The plasticized bodies are mostly real, used from Body Worlds.",1
"I did, and was I pleasantly surprised! I found myself enjoying all of it despite a few gaping holes in the plot! I couldn't see any comparison to films like Scream, Urban Legends, et al. Okay, but then the film would be over within a half hour.",1
"She is matched every step of the way by Matthau, who is more charming than ever. He also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with Richard Benjamin. There is not much of a plot to this movie. < br / > < br / > Art Carney is a riot all by himself as practically senile doctor. He is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him. IT DOES NOT MATTER!",1
The whole movie rocked.,1
"It's funny! But, still - - it's Walter Matthau in drag! If you're 25, wait until you're older to see it. Everything hits just exactly the right tone. It's a shame House Calls isn't better known. Could be.",1
"Too bad, because that scene just lays there now, another victim of music licensing Hell. That's where the similarities end, though. """,1
"However, Amos manages to convince Charlie to let him keep the job for reasons of self - esteem. So now he's the eligible bachelor. He gets her out of the device, and soon is romancing her. < br / > < br / > Matthau's Charlie has just been widowed before the film began. < br / > < br / > One day Charlie notices Ann in the hospital.",1
Followed by a failed TV series.,1
We are otherwise entertained by the on - off relationship of the two leads and various sub - plots. Deserves more attention than it seems to have received and well worth the cost of the DVD or video cassette. Their boss is hard - of - hearing going on senile Chief of Staff Art Carney who is up for re - election to that post.,1
"Just get this movie. I'm very glad it'out on DVD now, finally. You will not be disappointed. I loved it from the first scene, and all the way through to the end.",1
"This leads to the standard complications about how serious Charley is willing to become about Ann. Of course, Charley is on the show's discussion panel, and sparks, as they say, fly. Matthau is his usual 1970's curmudgeonly swinger and quite sight waddling with his gangly arms held akimbo in his power walk.",1
"< br / > < br / > You won't be disappointed. "" He then meets hospital patient Glenda Jackson and soon develops a relationship with her. It's must see for any Matthau fan or any fan of light comedy.",1
"Definitely worth a look, especially to the genre enthusiast. True to his word, the dreams that Wong has involve having mad donkey sex with smokin'hot schoolgirls - but the dreams come with a price that's more than money. More comparable to ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - a more "" carefree "" CATIII entry that delivers plenty in terms of nudity and a good bit of gore, without being overly comedic either.",1
"This, in my opinion, is Rob Lowe at his best.",1
"7 out of 10. The dream sequences are quite erotic and sleazy, so I'm not complaining.",1
Excellent film featuring Anthony Wong that certainly lives up to it's title. Excellent performances all round.,1
But they are doing so with style. Give it a watch.,1
< br / > < br / > An absolute must. < br / > < br / > Take it from a guy who knows movies.,1
"It isn't extreme, it isn't to be taken with umost seriousness, but it is really good. Toysome horror done well almost.",1
"The first half hour in particular was awesome. Lame, but scary at the time ) and the first three quarters of this film really hit the spot for me. Looking around I didn't see much that interested me, but saw The Doll Master in the new releases section.",1
"And they really work well with each other. I couldn't disagree more with those who says this is a lousy movie. Go see it. But if your out for a good, stylized scare then it's perfect. Now.",1
"This program is a favorite of our family, and we feel it MUST be released on DVD by seasons!! !",1
I thought and still think they should BRING IT BACK! I absolutely love Promised Land. So many lives can benefit from heaven inspired media. It is the Love that you hold in your heart for others ; which brings you to a higher destination. This is what caused me to fall in love with the show.,1
The best drama every is now on Gospel Music Channel! Hey Yall!,1
"Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. I give this a 55 / 100. Most folks will want to "" steer clear.",1
Anybody know if it is on DVD yet?? May we never forget Promise Land! Have a reunion show!! !,1
"Good cast, supporting cast ( among them, Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis ) and crew. Why this program only ran for 3 years is beyond me.",1
"Yes, it's Christian based, and traditionally as well. I absolutely loved this series, and was very sad to see it go. ).",1
"I saw'I Smell the Dead'- - sorry,'I SELL the Dead'- - at a press screening. < br / > < br / > The story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine.",1
The film is a great deal of fun. The cast is first rate. < br / > < br / > Worth a look.,1
"This has advantages and drawbacks. I Sell the Dead is a big, sloppy horror comedy that refuses to take itself too seriously. Grimes is killed with a Guillotine.",1
There is some animation thrown in which gives it a Tales From the Crypt feel. His partner had already been beheaded.,1
"< br / > < br / > See. Its laughs are subtle, but plentiful.",1
"Nice voice in the narration, too. < br / > < br / > This would be a fun and unusual date movie. I saw this at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival and liked it a lot.",1
"< br / > < br / > I'm increasing my rating to 7 / 10. May be it was the big screen viewing that helped? If you enjoy WW II films, I think you'll find this one interesting once the submarine gets underway.",1
"Finally, a horror film that's done well. Now I'm wondering if he's an American or not. I thought he was excellent in that role. It was that missing tooth.",1
"< br / > < br / > See this if you like : The Flesh And The Fiends, The Doctor And The Devils, Creepshow. And that's just what they try to do. It works well.",1
You bet. < br / > < br / > But was it funny?,1
Most of the plot from here is told in flashback form as Monaghan regails Duffy with tales of his macabre career. ( Note : I saw I SELL THE DEAD at the Glasgow International Film Festival on 20th January 2009. ) But there's something different about this corpse.,1
"There is an almost perfect blend of comedy to horror in this movie! Don't miss this one, you will regret it! Vampires to Zombies and even aliens!",1
"If you like horror, watch this. An easy film to just sit down and enjoy. There really isn't much to the story, it's simple and it works well. The acting is superb and the characters are engaging and oddly endearing.",1
"I just saw this at SIFF, and I absolutely loved it. I can't wait to see more from this talented young man. The performances make the movie. Bonus : Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! Some parts are scary and funny at the same time.",1
"I sell the dead revolves around convicted grave robber Arthur Blake. < br / > < br / > The characters were not extremely in - depth, but they were all interesting. < br / > < br / > The acting isn't amazing but I didn't find it bad at any point.",1
< br / > < br / > The costume and set design in this film were excellent. They played off each others acting with ease.,1
< br / > < br / > Overall the movie offers something very different to the current crop of mainstream horror and will leave a smile on your face. I saw this movie as part of the Midnite Madness at Sitges. < br / > < br / > The acting is strong and the casting of very familiar faces in Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimm lift movie above many of the others on view in Sitges.,1
It was more like Eastenders Goes to Sea than In Which We Serve. ).,1
"What was explored was done well, for the most part. That wasn't too great. Oh well. That is definitely so not true and very, very sad. < br / > < br / > Anyway, what was shown here in Lucy was pretty good. Everything here no one really needed to know. Yeah, would have gotten more in, been able to explore some more emotion.",1
I highly reccommend.,1
"< br / > < br / > As Lucille Ball, Rachel York does a commendable job. Madeline Zima was decent, if not overly memorable, as the teen - aged Lucy.",1
"This approach, I thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. I couldn't believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally. I thought Rachel York was fantastic as "" Lucy. "" My response to that is, "" So what? "" And Rachel certainly gave us that, in great depth. Lucy didn't fit mold of the old studio system. She is a chameleon who can play ( and sing ) anything!",1
This is speculation. The movie has a good cast. This is worth watching.,1
Clearly not denatured by the destructive meddlesomness of overzealous Network Exec. I highly recommend.,1
I thoroughly enjoyed this made for TV movie.,1
"Both end up helping each other to free themselves of their bitterness, which enables them to get unstuck. This film is completely underrated.",1
Even she managed to upstage Caine. He was hilariously funny through out. This is the best movie I've seen in ages!,1
"After several tense situations, the confrontation takes place. And it helps that he's lucky. It doesn't help that the class stereotypes which help define the enlisted men from the officers can be jarring. The Sea Tiger lets loose six torpedoes but has to dive, not knowing if it had done its job. They just miss the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and heads into the Baltic.",1
That's what this film is about. This movie is all about entertainment.,1
I laughed a lot. Look as being Anglo - Irish I assure you this reviewer is anything but Bias. The Cast is almost entirely Irish - it was shot in Ireland with an Irish crew.,1
This film is a joy to watch and should do well on DVD and video.,1
The latter delivers a truly wonderful Dublin accent.,1
The real star here is the fantastic Dylan Moran.,1
"Never mind. This, however, is where the script falters. A ham actor without a penny.",1
But clearly the true hero of this film is Mr Caine. < br / > < br / > She has most amazing smile. The Parole officer. As was Mr Gambon and the mad Scottish hitman. This man should do much more comedy.,1
< br / > < br / > I was stunned. It wouldn't be real otherwise.,1
"Submerged speed was barely twice that of human walking speed, and the net would have had a great deal of'give '. < br / > < br / > There was a wee bit too much shore - side drama for my tastes. If anything, it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda. The actors look suitably grimy and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate. This is an excellent tub - thumper from the war years.",1
Overall I would say see only if a fan of the actors involved. Caine's character seemed overdone to me. The plot is flimsy at best as several plot holes occur throughout.,1
"Todd isn't a bad guy, he is just a small time film maker with little to no budget and big dreams. You get to see some Kansas City locations and lots of raw meat, what could be better?",1
"The story is great, the gore is grand, the psychos are wicked! Thus allowing this man this modern day Genius craft his vision better.",1
"I love the old Drive - In fare like this movie. I was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock. Don't expect Romero, just second - rate Fulci. It has great camera work, and some cool editing tricks. It has no real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. It is gory. I am a glutton for B - movies.",1
< br / > < br / > I loved this movie! There is enough going on in this one to fill two more films! Pretty soon it's a showdown with humans fighting zombies. Just watched this one again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time.,1
There is another plot also going on in town where a couple of serial killer types have taken some workers at a deli hostage. Director Todd Sheets truly shows a major leap in style and talent between the two films. Zombie Bloodbath 2 : Rage of the Undead is next. At the same time a group of convicts escape from a nearby jail. Both groups end up at the same house. And this is all in the first half hour. It was fun and the acting was pretty darn good for a low budget effort. Wow.,1
"I would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish DV shot flicks that I have bought. This one movies at a fast clip, has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style. Even a movie like Bone Sickness that I like, has incredible stretches of DULL. It never stops long enough to let you catch your breath. So I say kudos to Mr. Not this movie. OK. < br / > < br / > Zombie Bloodbath 2 : Rage of the Undead. I give this film two bloody thumbs up! Sheets for trying to do something different with this one.",1
"The makeup / gore is much better than ZB1. It's big and it keeps moving. < br / > < br / > 2. I've really never seen anything like it. These are rare in low - budget zombie films. Her corpse is subsequently "" raped. "" Here's why I thought the movie was awesome : 1. you can't take it realistically. """,1
An evil demonic scarecrow resurrects the dead as ravenous rot - faced zombies so they can feast on the living.,1
"Nevertheless, I recommend it, with caution.",1
"Any film about WWII made during WWII by a British production company has no latter - day peer in my opinion, respectfully.",1
"All modern laws, as I understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root to exist in the first place and to become A law at all.",1
"However, it was a pretty suspenseful mini - series. < br / > < br / > I must warn people that the DVD is of very poor quality. Gough Whitlam is portrayed in a more noble, almost saintly, light. I had read the Wikipedia page about those events, but that was about it.",1
"it did not take sides and it pointed out the mistakes and lies of both sides. The leads were perfect. Watch it, learn from it and learn about our modern history. The Dismissa is now available on DVD in Australia.",1
"I know, as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward.",1
"As time went on, it became apparent that Australia was capable of standing on its own two feet. These are more or less regarded as the "" reserve powers of the Crown ( king / queen of Great Britain ). "" This shift was codified in the Australian Constitution. Accordingly, the UK granted Australia permission to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. Australia was colonised by the British.",1
"However, more could have been made of the bizarre fashion in which Morosi managed Cairns's office as Treasurer. The clear standouts for my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The adherence to the Lady Kerr / Lady Macbeth theme popular among Labor partisans was perhaps a little partial, though not ruinously so.",1
"< br / > < br / > Brooke Vandenberg ( Jane Kennedy ) is the senior female reporter on the show. The current - affairs show is headed by nicely - groomed Mike Moore ( Rob Sitch ), an ambitious, pretentious, dim - witted narcissist. < br / > < br / > "" Frontline "" boasts an ensemble of colourful characters, each with their own distinct and quirky personality.",1
"He often finds his morals being compromised simply because Brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest. His doesn't have principles so much as a nous of what makes a good journalistic story, though he does draw occasional line. What is really sad is that it also makes extremely funny.",1
10 yrs later the episodes all hold up really well! Great stuff! Even better it worked on my NTSC DVD player.,1
This is one of my favorite movies.,1
"This is an incredibly compelling story, told with great simplicity and grace.",1
"Conflicting desires of "" the people "" and the Government.",1
"Kingdom County, Vermont, 1927. < br / > < br / > My vote : 8 / 10.",1
I found Michael J.,1
"< br / > < br / > The music is fantastic, as are the period sets. In the end it is a tragedy.",1
"This is one of the rare cells of dignity in the independent film world, a film that explores a small piece of the intersection between humans and history. Jay Craven's criminally ignored film is a sober breath of fresh air in the generally narcissistic and derivative world of independent film.",1
"Performances of this calibre should be acknowledged. < br / > < br / > And the story itself...? Cinematographer Paul Ryan was exceptional. Like today, there are those who wield power that would have it otherwise. Fox. Craven is an admirer of Mosher's work - - he also directed'A stranger in the Kingdom '.",1
I read Howard Frank Mosher's novel many years ago.,1
She carries this movie alone.,1
"I think some parts are little cheesy, maybe the plot could use some more action. I saw this movie for the first time on a sick day from school about ten years ago. < br / > < br / > I've seen it maybe twice since then.",1
I highly reccommend this movie.,1
"Watch the flim, and if you've ever had a childhood friend that you dream with, and then for some reason, lost, you'll really like this film. The backdrop of this story is the 1967 World's Fair and the Centennial of Canada. The film's greatest moments come during the various fantasy sequences where we see just how they cope.",1
"It's up to fearless, rugged cop Jonathan Graves ( likable Peter Liapis ) to stop her. An entertainingly brainless piece of lovably lousy dreck.",1
And the acting is bad.,1
"Now, onto the movie. The Ghoulies series is pretty awesome. Ghoulies IV.",1
"In fact, I really enjoyed it. Wynorski is a genius. I have no regret of seeing this movie at all. Is it stupid?",1
It's 2007 now and no sign of a sequel yet. Jonathan is back once again in this one. It's a great dark comedy and funny! Then you've got the very hot Alexandra! I doubt it will happen though. Ghoulies 4 is pretty ghoulish sequel.,1
lol. I enjoyed the plot of the movie. It is worth watching even though the Ghoulies aren't in it.,1
Another difference is that two Ghoulies are the good guys unlike the ones in the previous films.,1
At least one kind.,1
7. Coppola also deserves credit for addressing the issue of domestic discontent from a woman's point of view in the culturally turbulent 60's.,1
"It's one of his best performances as he is very restrained and moving. It ' It was great seeing her so young, beautiful, and so wonderfully subtle in this movie. Then comes in the character of'Killer'played by James Caan. She plans to drive into America's heartland and start anew.",1
"It's on the Pennsylvania Turnpike that Natalie picks up hitchhiker Jimmie "" Killer "" Kilgannon, James Cann, who seems as lost and confused as she is. * * SPOILERS * * Simple movie about simple people who's problems are far too complex for them to handle. < It seems that Mr. Alfred is also the acting county judge and is the person that Natalie is to pay her traffic fine to.",1
"* * * from * * * * Some scenes ( such as Knight's first call home from a pay - phone, or her first night alone with Caan where they play'Simon Says') are almost too intimate to watch. It's a heady endeavor - - so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later. Coppola toys with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we've been made privy to.",1
< br / > < br / > This film has aged well.,1
"It's extraordinary in ways that mirror others in Coppola's films. This, too, is a dangerous character to take on, as it is a mix of childish bewilderment and amusement with scarred memories. It's one of those rare original dramas where some scenes stand alone as total knockouts.",1
The type of movie that could only have been spawned in the 60's.,1
For avid Sci - Fi fans this movie is just what you've been waiting for.,1
Excellent acting ( esp.,1
"The story flowed forward, didn't leave me yawning ( at least not much ) in any point. The directing was fabulous work.",1
"Location work, photography, and design ( production as well as creature design ) are all very impressive. Diesel is particularly good at getting under the skin of his intimidating character. < br / > < br / > A sequel of sorts is in the works.",1
"I believe that Pitch Black was done well. A very self - serving character that in the end gets what he deserves. This kind of movie always tends to be fun, as long as it's done well. The movies that come to mind immediately are Alien, Aliens, and Starship Troopers.",1
"Black out every 22 years. Lucky them, they land on that day. It opens with your cliche overly long ship flying through space. Aliens can only be in darkness, hey it's a solar eclipse. It was. I really can't wait for Chronicles of Riddick.",1
Unexpected. I haven't seen charisma like that since Schwarzenegger in the 80's.,1
"Based on my first viewing, I recently rated this movie a 5. I am so glad I did. I thought Riddick was the sole survivor. It's much more of a human drama. There isn't an excessive, tiresome focus on the monsters. I thought Claudia Black's character was the first to die. < br / > < br / > I see now that the movie works * extremely * well. That they were allergic to light was something I found especially ridiculous. This was not so. There's so much of what I thought I remembered from the first viewing that turned out to be wildly inaccurate. Then we come to a planet with three suns.",1
i thought the drama and suspense kept the viewers really intrigued. Oh my gosh! Keep it up Vin!,1
"If you can find this move, don't miss it.",1
There was one thing that I felt was a little under done. If they were to do books or comics it would be a great read. ! He would be the most logical choice for the role.,1
All in all this is a very good movie though not perfect. it still pulls off and introduces the viewer to some new ideas.,1
"Close to picking ore over occupants, the crash landing derails her ultimate course of action. Too bad, because PITCH BLACK actually does kick major ass. They are not alone on the planetoid.",1
! I give it 2 thumbs up!!,1
I really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end. The only question really is who's next to snuff it. Because it'stylish. etc. The acting is above average. And above all it isn't predictable.,1
"But it isn't alien, it's something else. It maches well into Alien series. OK, enough comparisons. It's impossible.",1
I really enjoyed this movie. In Pitch Black he plays an anti - hero to the max. < br / > < br / > I also saw Iron Giant and Vin is perfect.,1
"By the time night falls, it is great. This film gets off to a bad start. Thrilling, horrifying and exciting. You feel as if you were watching "" Deep Blue Sea "" meets "" Silence of the Lambs "", minus the good bits.",1
< br / > < br / > I loved how the writers gave each main character a history and showed their flaws and strengths without much confusion. He certainly keeps you guessing right up to the very end. But to plainly put it : This movie freaked me out... in a good way.,1
This is one of the great westerns of the nineteen - forties and highly recommended.,1
The weaker parts of the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes.,1
"I was captivated. < br / > < br / > The film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, introducing the character of Richard Riddick. Don't take my word for it... see it for yourself. Sound to good to be true? I just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it.",1
"< br / > < br / > Roll on Chronicles ofiddick! The crew have to rely on him to try to get them to safety. While the survivors of the wreck are getting their bearings, an eclipse of all three suns happens.",1
"This is without doubt the most exciting and satisfying film I've seen in years! Sometimes he draws your attention by not speaking - or by not moving. < br / > < br / > From the opening shot to the But the film belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the most magnetic screen presence I've seen in years. But it's really not that simple - every character is complex, three - dimensional, with conflicting traits so you never quite know who's good and who's bad. Special effects showing both Riddick's and the monsters'points of view add to the suspense, as do sound effects of the monsters flying and using ultrasound to "" see "" ( the monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and suitably frightening ). The lighting effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - the overbright triple sunlight and the pitch darkness. < br / > < br / > Technically the film is very good.",1
You won't be disappointed. There are so many metaphors in the story!,1
It's there to entertain the audience - it does so with ease. The ship has been hit by something. This isn't a deep film by any means. < br / > < br / > It opens with a galaxy of stars.,1
"Overall, a very entertaining movie.",1
Pitch Black is a survival story. Characters start to live in the movie. He does great job as Riddick. Keep your friends close and enemies even closer.,1
Followed by complete darkness of nightfall.,1
Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is the lighting.,1
"I think there'5 movies altogether. Who remembers the movie about the St Benard Beethoven? I was totally addicted after watching it for the first time. But this is one of my favorites. The music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful. Beyond that, people wont be bothered to watch it.",1
"This film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of climactic shootout. It is actually Jack who is behind the murders, but Cheyenne's troubled past is hard to get away from. Will Upton uncover Uncle Willie and Banker Clanton's treacherous scheme?",1
"Baby learning the dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes! Baby is going to start college in the Fall. < br / > < br / > The music is great and the dancing is wonderful! "". Jennifer Grey plays Frances "" Baby "" Houseman in Dirty Dancing. and then realizing just how stupid that was! The Movie takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time I watch it.",1
I would love to live such a story. The story is great and it really moved me.,1
Please reply to this. 2.,1
"The chemistry between Swayze and co - star Jennifer Grey is amazing. I heard whispers he was meant for the role but they found out he couldn t dance. Great movie and I'm so pleased Billy Zane didn't win the movie role. He sings "" She's Like The Wind "" in the movie. I love all the dancing and everything that goes with it. Like I said it's an amazing chick flick.",1
"< br / > < br / > An amazing film, perfect for a girly night in. When young Frances'Baby'Houseman goes to summer camp with her family, she never expected to have so much fun!",1
"! for this movie, it literally gave me goosebumps when i watched it.",1
I was so wrong. ! I love the music and the dancing. They were both such good dancers. She loved it and always watched it.,1
without them i think it would be a mess. patrick an Jennifer did so well together. this movie was made in 1997 its time to make another one.,1
< br / > < br / > this film is perfect!,1
Dirty Dancing - The Way Love Is Mean To Be! I love the plot and enjoyed every moment of it!,1
"even though movie is in 1943, it is in colour. i liked this western Starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford. there's gunfights, action, chases on horseback. there's a bit of a romance angle that's hinted at. it's got pretty much everything a western should have.",1
Dirty Dancing - I think everyone has seen this movie at one time or another. The song is perfect and the dancing is amazing!,1
And the ending was absolutely FANTASTIC. Dirty Dancing one of my MOST favorite movies. I also loved the dancing - - who WOULDN'T?,1
"This movie also has one of my favorite all time movie lines : "" I carried the watermelon. ).",1
"Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny, a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and lithe gymnasts. < br / > < br / > The dancing in "" Dirty Dancing "" is not to be forgotten.",1
"I do now. Nevertheless, still very good. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Exceede my expectations! And she did really look awkward at times. I didn't really want to see Dirty Dancing either.",1
but i was proved wrong when i actually sat down to watch this.,1
"a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!",1
"! or "" I'm sorry you had to see that Baby.",1
That was a mistake. He tells his wife to go back to sleep. < br / > < br / > DIRTY DANCING is a film about change.,1
"< br / > < br / > Randy and Glenn both got girls here. That leads to all kinds of complications, a lot for a film that's not even 90 minutes long. And definitely not during war time.",1
"Besides 2 lead actors the soundtrack makes the film the beauty that it is. This is the best movie ever, but that is my opinion.",1
9 every time. thank - you sorry though for only the short comment.,1
"He gives his character a comprehensive personality, strong appeal and great depth. But what is wonderful about Baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension to her character. The dancing is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved. I would highly recommend it.",1
"It has the love story, the music, and most of all lots of dancing. No wonder it still attracts kids and even adults Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well. It happened anyway! Jennifer and Patrick could revive their roles easily. I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical.",1
Swayze was brilliant just like Grey was too! period the actors will always have this superb film their career!,1
< br / > < br / > There is something timeless about this movie. I can't even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing.,1
!,1
Yeah. I remember this in a similar vein to the Young Ones.,1
Radical art lives on!,1
There is also quite a fistfight. I have my doubts.,1
One of best comedies to ever grace the screen.,1
Be forewarned! I love Meatballs! They have no connection to Ivan Reitman's masterpiece.,1
I always looked forward to it.,1
"What, no mustard?! "" "" Oh my God his nose is bleeding. "" Look out! """,1
"no mustard? "" Applause, applause! Especially during Summer.",1
"They're insipid, vulgar, and, most importantly, not funny. This one could be seen as a refreshing blast from the past.",1
As I have gotten older I watch this movie for different reasons. The film is also full of funny one liners.,1
"One nice thing about this movie, it has a message. The story line is simple and easy to follow. Murray has done better, but this is his first film.",1
"I know that was a goofy movie, but I enjoyed it immensely.",1
"< br / > < br / > In 1863, the economy in the town of Red Valley, Utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the Union Army. Only Fox's "" Jesse James "" ( also starring Randolph Scott ) from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this lavish a treatment to the genre. All this stuff doesn't necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943. There is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed, a spectacular barroom brawl, an explosive climax, romance, and three - strip Technicolor. He wants to go straight, especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner Alison McLeod ( Evelyn Keyes ). Unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy.",1
"The biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director. < br / > < br / > The film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. Above it all is Bill Murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut. He really seems to have some good chemistry with Makepeace. But before it's all over, Murray's performance makes this plot device more than bearable.",1
"Bill seems to carry the movie all by himself. A side note to this review is to avoid ALL of the Meatball movie sequels. They are horribly bad. It's rated PG. "" It has been done many times in other movies. Are You Ready For The Summer? "" There is some mild sexual innuendo and maybe one or two cuss words in the entire film. The plot is predictable.",1
"It'Meatballs, for crying out loud! To each his own. Why read a review?",1
"Meatballs "" packs lots of comedy in this film. stars! This movie shows that camp can be fun, if you wanted to be! The rest of the can are just as crazy as Tripper.",1
This movie would also set the stage for summer camp movies with the competition at the end.,1
Elmer Bernstein's lively and melodic score likewise does trick. A real riot.,1
"Meatballs "" promises such and ultimately delivers nourishing watch. The reason I like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has.",1
"At least half the characters seem like real people... and mostly real people you would like to have around. We also get some truly lame slapstick, mostly in the opening credits. ( "" Lobsters... get out of here... you're a menace! "" < br / > < br / > First of all, there's the music. Or maybe he's just that great - turning a weak script into comic genius. The best part are his surreal PA announcements. There are only 5 songs in the movie, most of them used more than once. It's just plain awful.",1
"The rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated. Let's hope he completes the trilogy. < br / > < br / > It does get a little too smarmy for its own good, but that is also one of its charms.",1
"It's a summer camp movie through and through which simply wants to entertain you. I'm licked and just can't help loving this. The film mostly contains hi - jinx of fellow teen camp counselors cutting up and goofing around. The film also shows the growing bond between Tripper and a quietly lonely, puppy - dog eyed Rudy ( Chris Makepeace of "" Vamp "" fame ), whose dad is often away all the time.",1
"This is easily the best of the summer camp movies. The adventures ( and misadventures ) of these two are hilarious. It's a great "" root for the underdogs "" finale.",1
Recommended for those who enjoyed STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.,1
"Or "" Whitewater Summer ""? No, it's not Citizen Kane. Spaz. It just doesn't matter. I mean, this stuff is classic!",1
It is a must - see. It is funny and sweet and just all - around fun.,1
"For me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years. I can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining. The opening title song that goes "" Are you ready for the summer?... That's what MEATBALLS ( MB ) is.",1
"< br / > < br / > The overall theme of the movie is the underdog overcoming obstacles to finally win. He reminds us of the funny cool staff member who everyone loves. But we also had a dedicated camp staff guiding us to be best we could be. Meatballs "" is an ode to summer camp. The movie has heart.",1
"Maybe because it's a sweet, sweet movie.",1
"The music doesn't pretend too much but it achieves a lot, not more than a snare drum, cymbal, a some strings. wife? Thanks good a movie like this was done and released. < br / > < br / > The kind of movie that demands too much from the audience, yet to disappoint most of them. There's nothing accidental in this movie, the family is and has what many families, in Mexico at least, share.",1
Watch this movie if you like brave films. Yes.,1
"Crónica "" is something difficult to digest, it get stuck in the throat and anything helps for it. Excuse me if I'm wrong, but "" Cronica para un desayuno "" could be one of the most gretatest films in tne mexican movie history for a lot of reasons. So I recommend to get some Melox before the show, because you won't get hungry after all.",1
Her depiction of a dying woman is perfect. !,1
This is now my most treasured movie. Rent it.,1
"Her chameleonic portrayals never fail to astonish ; she seems actually to be the characters she brings to the screen. Meryl Streep may be the greatest actor working today. Director Carl Franklin ( "" Devil in a Blue Dress "" ) handles extremely difficult story material with sureness and delicacy.",1
I loved this movie. She is the finest actress of our time.,1
< br / > < br / > JERICHO MILE was made ahead of it's time. < br / > < br / > This movie makes you walk away feeling you haven't been cheated any level. It's a masterpiece. ! It's about time Hollywood got their act together.,1
"Streep earned her eleventh Oscar nomination for this performance. These terms are only general. While on the other hand, she admires her father - who shares a special passion : Writing. But it is Renee Zellweger who steals this movie. < br / > < br / > Without giving too much away, "" One True Thing "" is a masterpiece in character study.",1
Brava Bette Midler!!,1
To me is truly beautiful. I can relate to many details in the movie.,1
Streep will surely receive an Oscar nomination for her role. It's no Best Picture or anything... don't be silly.,1
A must see film.,1
"), Renee Zellweger and William Hurt. To NOT be dysfunctional would be dysfunctional! They didn't miss much of the nightmare, it's hard to forget.",1
"Which isn't to say that it's a bad movie. Her relationship with her father ( William Hurt ) is quite interesting. and "" who? """,1
"I am trying to say that it takes a lot for a movie to generate emotional tears from an attending crowd. The script of this movie was really fantastic. And indeed, that this could happening to you. The characters were perfectly casted. In fact, the movie is down right depressing.",1
Stoic.,1
We can expect too much of our mates. I give this one ten.,1
"I think her critics are confusing self - consciousness with intelligence. I wonder if it's conceivable for any of Streep's pictures to not seem diminished because of her presence... I don't think she's cold at all, but instead has thought out her character's unique qualities. Anyway, Kate loves her home, and her affection for her "" family life "" is as endearing as her new conflict within home is jarring.",1
"She is wonderful is every part that she plays. No breaks! There is always one in every family who faces that kind of responsibility. This movie mirrors the reality of life. That is Kate Ellen, and many women in our society. He is not strong enough to cope. The story takes a very realistic view on the illness of a parent.",1
This is the timeframe in women's lives when they become the caretakers of aged and ill parents.,1
"Zeleweger is seething, angry and surprised with herself. Tom Everett Scott doesn't have much to do, but he does it well.",1
She's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how. ) The characters they play seem human ; they're not perfect people. ).,1
You see humanity at its best AND at it's worst. I implore you to watch this movie and take it's meaning to heart. That there is only one true thing and that is... love.,1
John Carradine thought he was so high and mighty. I like every actor in this movie. John Carradine wasn't Dracula and he never will be. < br / > < br / > This is a very good addition to the monster movies.,1
"no mummy? ) you can't help but enjoy this schlock fest! But remember, I never said it was good, just fun. I highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies.",1
A worthy addition to my video collection. At 1 hour 7 min. it packs quite a punch.,1
"< br / > < br / > This film is definitely one of my all time favorites. A film that deserved theatrical release. I highly recommend recording it, since it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland and the DVD is region encoded. You may not recognize the names, but you will recognize every face.",1
"< br / > < br / > It's beautiful! works. And the striptease number, like the'Jenny'number in Star! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently. And so is maintaining innocence. Blake Edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality.",1
"It has many high points. Dr. Edleman's transformation into the "" Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde "" type character was also done very well. Especially seeing the wolf man get cured. Yet somehow they return in House of Dracula with no explanation. < br / > < br / > And it's great to see Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolf Man together, one "" last "" time. Then there'd be no plot holes.",1

Worth watching twice.,1
< br / > < br / > Rating : stars out of 5. Also starring Onslow Stevens ( Them! Great fun.,1
"Not to denigrate Mr. Westmore's ability but horror films were just not his forte. OK, to watch or not to watch. This film was made as a hasty sequel to the fairly better made "" House of Frankenstein "" from a year earlier.",1
well good ole Larry Talbot ( Lon Chaney Jr ) shows up also seeking a cure. and then this one.,1
Recommended. It's a great film but the accent is more on comedy. He wants Edelamn to cure his vampirism - - Edelman agrees.,1
"House of Dracula "" isn't all that bad of a film and is rather decent at times. There's even a microscope slide of the parasite that is believed responsible for the condition. There is one main idea that is quite creative and imaginative. The Wolf Man has a marvelous scene where he transforms inside a prison cell to the doubting members of the search party and goes crazy. It's a thoroughly decent affair. He starts work on a potential cure involving blood transfusion, the Wolf Man, Lawrence Talbot, ( Lon Chaney Jr. ) arrives at his estate looking for a cure to lycanthropy.",1
"There isn't as much action but the acting is just as good. "" House of Dracula "" is a good sequel to "" House of Frankenstein "". ).",1
But my favorite part is Larry Talbot ( The Wolf Man ) searching for the cure for his lycanthropy.,1
i think peter Strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie. they are great people i bless them all. i love watching the Jericho mile. great movies get watched more than movies that are not.,1
"The Wolf Man "", shows up and of course he * really * wants to be cured. The women are gorgeous, and I have to say that I loved Jane Adams as the luminous nurse - who happens to be hunchbacked. All - Monster congregation in the final film in Universal's renowned cycle of classic horror stories. Naturally, this is just a ruse. It's a respectable series entry overall. Stock footage and library music are re - used here as well. Then, coincidentally, Larry Talbot ( Lon Chaney ), a. k. a. """,1
"< br / > < br / > The story ignores most of the events of the previous entry, "" House of Frankenstein "", and introduces a new angle to the story. Soon Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster that must be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula's blood is also developing a disease in him. The discovery of Frankenstein's monster ( Glenn Strange ) in a nearby catacombs will bring more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist.",1
"Lon Chaney Jr. plays the Wolf Man, and John Carradine, Dracula and Glenn Strange, the Frankenstein monster.",1
"7 / 10. People underrate that film and Chaney's performance in it. Here, he would be justifiably criticized as wooden. As a semi - vampire, the doctor goes insane and awakens Frankenstein's Monster. A nice waste of time. collapses on top of him and is consumed by flames. All in all, though, it's a pretty fun movie at just 68 minutes.",1
At least in House Of Frankenstein he was up and around a bit. This is a very underrated performance. < br / > < br / > The monster isn't given much to do this time. The doctor becomes a bloodthirsty maniac at certain times. Where does the hat go when he changes into a bat...? It gets a low 8. He isn't chewing up the scenery as he will in later roles. Many people want to compare it to House Of Frankenstein. But it isn't a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes.,1
"Adams her beautiful face in alarming contrast to her twisted body, exhibits great pathos and sympathy. I hope Universal releases it soon on DVD ( it was left out of their Double - Feature releases ). He seeks Dr. Edelmann's help to cure him of his vampirism.",1
"The Wolf Man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction! Then, what can only be described as a coincidence, sees Lawrence Talbot, a. k. a. < br / > < br / > Overall, this film isn't as good as the earlier House of Frankenstein. Dracula's plot is the biggest at first, but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end.",1
I love this movie!,1
"Who knows maybe I'll be a game someday. Plus the sound track was pretty good. very cool "" as my youngest would say.",1
As I said I expected SO much less. Lighthearted. Fun! The acting is quite good. < br / > < br / > The story moves right along.,1
!,1
"< br / > < br / > I created a Druedain warrior monk, yeah, not that far from the film. The poking of fun out of this never comes to an end and rightfully so. < br / > < br / > For this end, in turn, there is no better profession than the bard.",1
"Gamers : DR is not a fancy made movie, it's more like amateur video. For people never play RPG game, I'm sure you still get many fun from it.",1
< br / > < br / > It has it all.,1
"Lesser shows I will not even watch. This is pure art, it's that good.",1
"< br / > < br / > The bard that always gets killed had me rolling. < br / > < br / > In some ways it reminded me of an early Kevin Smith film. Best fan boy movie I've ever watched save "" Free Enterprise. "" But in the end... The sexually confused player also had me smiling a bit too. A real unexpected treat.",1
Any case if you are a game or know about gaming check this one out you will enjoy it. With the help of some new blood they attempt the campaign again with hopes of finishing this time. This is the latest film from The Dead Gentlemen group responsible for the original Gamers film and the Demon Hunters films. < br / > < br / > This movie is a breath of fresh air in the movie community and a great improvement over the original. So this is why I give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 that I initially thought of. The acting is fairly decent and the jokes are quite funny.,1
"< br / > < br / > 2. Really? What, like D & D?",1
I laughed so hard while watching this. They are more for killing and looting instead of role playing. So if you want a fun film try it.,1
"Speaking of action, Brian Lewis makes his film debut as Cass, the third and most influential member of Lodge's motley crew. Yet he seems to gravitate socially towards Gary, the youngest of the group. This groundbreaking film is truly a work of art. But from the opening credits "" Dorkness "" had me.",1
"Anyway, the genre really interests me.",1
"Just got back from the European Premiere of The Gamers : Dorkness Rising. < br / > < br / > In the end it does make scoring this movie quite hard, so I have given it 2 scores.",1
"The jokes are hilarious, but they seem unevenly spread throughout the movie. Or will the three maintain a platonic friendship, deepened by camaraderie of role - playing? < br / > < br / > 2. Odd, but Blazing Saddles always struck me that way as well... and I love that movie, too. Will Joanna become the GM's girlfriend? Will she go back to Cass?",1
But other filmmakers could learn a lot from them. I had some time to kill and decided to check it out. The pacing perfect. The action tense. And it was more than enough. It should be no surprise that there was a huge standing ovation when the closing credits rolled. It played to about 1000 people in a packed standing - room - only ballroom. The script was tight. How often does that happen at screenings?,1
"Soon, perhaps?...",1
! I saw Dorkness Rising and thought it was HILARIOUS! The acting was great and the field shots / set were believable.,1
These guys are so funny and fun to watch.,1
i will love to show this movie.,1
Based on a True Story... < br / > < br / > The premise of this film is to illustrate that through fairly normal events its possible for an outwardly'decent'mother to get drawn into Heroin addiction. < br / > Some radar! NOT A HAPPY WOMAN when she takes her next bath and its'disappeared '.,1
Spoiled! } I loved this film!,1
this is more than a Sat. One of the least know really great films. afternoon special. This one's a keeper.,1
"But they're both excellent. You'll still cry to this version, but perhaps you won't have the musical prompts to set you off. < br / > < br / > There'room for both - and having seen this on stage, I would say that the Ackland / Bloom one is slightly more faithful.",1
< br / > < br > Very highly recommended.,1
"It gave me a detailed glimpse of the intellectual, theological and moral considerations that motivated C. S. Lewis. This version did not move me as deeply as the later, Hollywood version starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger.",1
"It is well executed, acted and directed. Very touching. Very Heartlt performances.",1
"This is a wonderful movie... it's funny, dark, poignant, thought - provoking, innocently naughty and generally entertaining all around. Franklins, "" despite the darkness around the edges, manages to have a thoroughly sincere and pure heart.",1
"WARNING : MAJOR Spoiler ALERT. Then one day they are headed to a church picnic and are in an accident. The premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to their church. That is unless Caroline removed all evidence that the pie was laced. From there the parents and her brother change ; what with being knocked out and "" saved "" by Jesus. Yet she prays a lot, as does her family. Or so we are led to believe.",1
"You know little issues like Religion, sex and the truth. This film takes off on its own unique direction.",1
The film is thought provoking and hiious at the same time.,1
it is definitely thought provoking. it is amazing to see the characters evolve. Applause applause Jay i hope you are working on another movie. my husband and i really enjoyed Jay's style.,1
"'When they return to their lives, many of their views and attitudes have changed, much to the consternation of the daughter, who didn't share the experience.",1
"Based on his credits, he may be another Quentin Tarantino.",1
"< br / > < br / > How refreshing it is to see a darkish comedy that can dare to be humanistic. Bravo. How nice to see actors so fully committed to character they can dare to let them be ridiculous and sublime. One of my favorites at Outfest this year. There is truth and history behind even the most questionable acts in this film, which is a difficult task in satire. < br / > < br / > Bravo.",1
I love this film. I understand a release date is coming up in the fall. maybe ever.,1
Forgiving the Franklins is the best film I have seen in years.,1
I was delighted by its honesty and humor.,1
"ESPN Classic, PLEASE SHOW THIS FILM!! 'The Jericho Mile'is a gem of a film. The additional casting is good. The only time he feels in another zone is in running. ! His final act made me stand up and cheer.",1
"Well done, Jay, yes... give up your day job! Forgiving the Franklins was a total delight and extremely funny in spots. I agree with the other 9 and 10 star reviews. This was his debut as a director.",1
A friend told me about this film. Top notch in every area.,1
< br / > < br / > The cast is terrific. fosteronfilm. com / phil / forgiving.,1
That Blu is a real meany.,1
"That was quite some time ago, but still remembered it. But that's not dominant. It's fairly humorous most of the time. Blockbuster doesn't have it anymore. At least when taken from my western viewpoint. The contrasts of societies are accentuated in the overplay.",1
So watch this movie.,1
"They are too shocked to do anything at first but decide soon to investigate. Instead of just being a clothes closet, the wardrobe opens into Paris! Some, like the music teacher, are thrilled and in awe. The film has many twists and turns and is both funny and mesmerizing.",1
"Look! hahah! """,1
See any of his films if you can. I mean this movie is truly funny.,1
Anyone trying to understand shift in Russian cultural sentiments since the fall of the USSR should begin here.,1
Our favorite scene? !,1
"definitely recommended. I had a great laugh while watching it. I love this movie. I am surprised that this was one a good comedy. this thing is so funny. It was free to watch, so why not.",1
This is the underrated Kellie Martin's best role. < br / > < br / > Mike Porter The movie is well written and acted.,1
"My vote is seven. In many dramatic situations, the expression of her face is not convincing.",1
"It, like many experimental films, has no real mass - audience appeal - - it's not for them. How important is the director, anyway?",1
It has an almost dizzying affect on you but at the same time is exciting. This is a documentary unlike any other. Even they are somewhat in the dark as to what Greaves is trying to do.,1
"Above all else, this film seeks to confound, confront. and stimulate, and without a doubt, succeeds admirably.",1
A film of high intelligence and activity. Don't expect to be bored by this film.,1
Highly Recommended!,1
"The message is clear. The film is not for everyone. There is a lot of indecision, an lot of conflicting feelings. < br / > < br / > Some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions.",1
).,1
"The second ( not animated ) movie about the only people still refusing to surrender to the Roman Empire is even more hilarious than the first film "" Asterix & Obelix contre Ceasar "". ).",1
"My vote is seven. This movie is very funny, specially the parts where Obelix and Pirates leaded by Red Beard participate.",1
"Eh oui, impossible n'est pas gaulois. that make for a really great movie.",1
?,1
Overall a great movie This movie is just great...,1
But with the French language you just have to read to understand. It is a great movie especially for kids. The French people are not known to be great movie producers.,1
"This wasn't necessary or even credible, either for the little love story of Astérix. For example the fighting between Numerobis and Amonbofis.",1
"Again, I fear it wouldn't be nearly as funny when the voices are dubbed. < br / > < br / > Overall not a bad movie at all, much better than the previous one. Movies are simply a different medium than comics. The above line sums it up pretty good. I have to mention that I watched the french version. The french version, that is. It's actually fun to watch. ).",1
"There'nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art. "" The lesson ultimately learned here? """,1
"It becomes things like Malcom ( i ) X and "" utenriks "", which is Norwegian for foreign affairs. < br / > < br / > Recommended in all languages with a good translation!",1
"In the original French version, the jokes of Numérobis ( great, funny voice - Jamel Debbrouze ) are very funny.",1
"Also, for fans of the comics the hilarious pirates get a look making up for their absence in film. Royal Architect Edifis seeks the help of Asterix, Obelix and druid Getafix to complete his task.",1
This movie would have deserved a 10 if Clavier hadn't involved.,1
I loved it. She's good but the role is little more than a cameo. I loved it so much that I can't understand why the movies have never been released in the United States. Personally I'm gonna stick with the dub when I watch this again since its easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the humor.,1
"It is the first time I can recall where an adaptation did exactly like the book... Ah, watch the movie folks! In fact, only jokes were added to the story rather than content blended or removed! Clavier playing the little indomitable Gaul was perfect and a far cry from his days as the bumbling squire of Jean Reno in "" Just Visiting. """,1
"I just managed to find a copy of "" Mission Cleopatra, "" which is not as easy as you would think for someone living in the United States.",1
"This movie is a big mix of all the kind of humor I really like, and even if maybe it'mixing it too much, I can't help but to like it.",1
( like the scene where waldo is part of the Egyptian crowd ). ! But overall an excellent movie!,1
"But then again, it's an OK kind of movie.",1
"The music, story and the action. I always loved this film. I wish she sang to me in Vietnam. The characters are appealing.",1
": ) < br / > < br / > aka "" Asterix e Obelix : Missão cleópatra "" - Brazil It's so happy and cheerful!",1
"It maked the film to childies. Wow! Well.. they did it right this time! Asterix : "" They will never look for it here "" ( guess again ).",1
!,1
I could easily see why it was such a huge box - office success in France.,1
"I would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves "" Astérix et Obélix "". I imagine some of the jokes weren't that easy to translate.",1
"This is definitely a "" must see "" film.",1
"< br / > < br / > The uncut French version is great fun, but sadly does not appear to be available in a version with English subtitles outside of the UK DVD. The results ain't good.",1
"Take my word for it and rent this today! They both do an asunding job, often bringing you to tears.",1
"Well worth the rental. If you enjoy riddles and suspense, you will enjoy this movie.",1
"If you've never been "" Tromatized "", this is the Troma movie to see first.",1
It's funny. < br / > < br / > It'a good DVD.,1
It's glorious.,1
Superb!,1
It'that good!,1
Go! Get it!,1
What a riot!,1
Anybody who appreciates lowbrow visuals and a hilarious script will without a doubt fall in love with this movie.,1
YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! It is awesome!,1
! This is a cult classic for sure!,1
But that's the world'loss. It won't of course. I know I wasn't.,1
Yes! Now go out and rent the movie!!,1
Joefro etc. Nothing can beat < br / > < br / > that. One of the more interesting films I've seen.,1
"ROMEO AND JULIET had been interpreted in so many ways, but very few of the versions captured the essance of the play. However, the film has an honest feel about it. At first glance, this is another mere splatterfest, and many would think it bastardizes the Shakespearian classic.",1
< br / > < br / > THIS is the movie high school literature classes should show instead of making poor students read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare's scripts. Thumbs up!,1
and thats only a taste of what it has to offer!,1
It is renegade filmmaking at it'best. Will Keenan gives a great performance as Tromeo.,1
"Wow, this movie is amazing. Must see for all TROMA FANS! I like her.",1
"Unfortunately their fathers are at each other as Juliet's dad wants to take over Tromeo's dad's movie studio, but could love really conquer them all and stop this feud? Kabukiman NYPD.",1
I am still not sure if the film is based on an true story or not....... How wrong I was. There is no major special effects or fancy gimmickry here at all. I had presumed it was a sci - fi b movie of some sort. I watched this film not knowing anything about it.,1
"Apart from it's historical significance, Tromeo & Juliet is a treasure for film - lovers of all kind. Not only for the script by James Gunn, now a good influence on Hollywood while working from the inside, but also because it features an early part of legendary actress Debbie Rochon. Well known by everyone familiar with films that are made on lower budgets. Some are good, many are mediocre.",1
This outlandish Troma movie is actually a very good movie.,1
"The end. Get some popcorn, grab a beer invite your friends over and enjoy Tromeo and Juliet for what it is, a Shakespeare adaptation with plenty of balls. Expect plenty of nods to other Troma films and plenty of re - used gags ( flipping cars and head squashing ).",1
"And Tromeo, a true romantic. < br / > < br / > Anyway, enjoy! I have made my friends cringe describing it to them.",1
"It breaks many taboos. This movie is a dream coming true. There are sex, violence, humor and satire. < br / > < br / > This movie is neither disgusting nor stupid. I'm not even a Troma fan. And I've seen a lot. Shakespeare would likely be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic. I really cared for the characters.",1
"< br / > < br / > Otherwise, he will hate it.",1
"Kabukiman N. Y. P. D. this film is an instant Troma classic. I enjoyed this movie very much. The actors handle the script very well. Like The Toxic Avenger, Troma's War, Class of Nuke'em High, Terror Firmer and Sgt. < br / > < br / > I highly recommend this movie. Lloyd Kaufman doesn't disappoint because you know what to expect from his films and other Troma productions.",1
"On paper, and in books, it appears that Monty gave away his life's work for free. Yes!! After disasters like Sgt. They finally got it down to perfection. Lloyd would make this one the most unapologetic, outlandish and downright hilarious Troma movie yet.",1
"This movie is truly unique. Troma at its best, this film really is a gem, and goes in my top 5 favourite movies of all time.",1
Tyrone ( Tybalt in Shakespeare ) has a particularly funny death scene.,1
"And finally, Jane Booker is welcome to guard my body any time.",1
"Overall, well worth watching, better than the recent version in pretty much all departments. Margaret Tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as Clothilde. It is beautifully filmed, with nice photography and period detail, and the music as always is excellent.",1
The female bodyguards are good value too and the episode contains one of my favourite Hickson lines...'An Archdeacon? Tour guide Madge was irritating in a different way but often quite amusing. ! Highly recommended. She threatens to go over the top towards the end but just avoids it. < br / > < br / > On the whole it is very faithful to the book.,1
Check her out as Julie Andrews's friend in the 1964 THE AMERICANIZATION OF EMILY. Shame on them!,1
so she can be enjoyed to the fullest. She is on the edge of over - acting but her role can have it. A good long shot of her monologue ( thanks Tucker! ),1
"The level of acting is utterly superb, Joan Hickson is sublime in the part, as always! Watch and enjoy.",1
Mr Rafiel is the same Rafiel as was in A Caribbean Mystery and so there is a sense of a connection here.,1
Basic film grammar puts an end to its supremacy.,1
"< br / > < br / > There are numerous faults in the film. 7 / 10. In actual fact it's a light - hearted, though not overly funny, romp about a couple of highwaymen.",1
"As the tag line says, "" they rob the rich... and that's it. "" No. With the Chief Justice's ward, Rebecca ( Liv Tyler ). Jonny Lee Miller's eyes. So it might not be entirely historically accurate. And there is little or no real character development. Plunkett and MaCleane. Rebecca?",1
"I just totally loved it! One of best movies ever, hands down. So many clues and twitches and puzzles.",1
"Plunkett and Macleane is an entertaining, fast - paced and refreshing film. It won't make you think, but it could well put smile on your face.",1
My recommendation? This movie is great.,1
"Where is it? ( exits to switch on DVD player! ) < br / > < br / > My one gripe about this film is that it isn't shown enough on TV! This has to be my favourite film. Truly excellent, sharp and classy - you'll not regret watching it - again and again!",1
I adore this film.,1
Or so I thought!,1
"There is also, of course, a love interest.",1
Absolutely worth seeing. I highly recommend this movie.,1
"Fantastic performance by Robert Carlysle and everybody else involved. Not to give anything away, but this one really get's the heart beating! Some great comical lines - actually laugh out loud, amazing action and a great plot. A brilliant'baddy'who really makes you hate him.",1
Thanx mostly to Craig Armstrong's amazing score. The direction is faultless and has an irresistible lighthearted feel. Just mainly comic book villains. < br / > < br / > The DVD is in Dolby 5. He really does deserve a might ass kicking. 35 : 1 anamorphic picture.,1
watch this movie you should enjoy it. chilling might be a more accurate description. ( thankfully ).,1
"I just wonder how they missed Adam Ant's "" Stand and Deliver. "" It's pure escapism and a wonderful lark. Make no mistake, this is not a serious film. He seems to understand the material here and pulls off a fine film. The pieces tend to fit the mood of the aired scenes, so it mostly works well. With time he may prove to be a name to reckon with.",1
"And what do you know, I actually liked it! ), it fit quite perfectly.",1
I suggest not.,1
"I'm not sure how well the jokes will translate across the ocean but hopefully they will. Normally I hate period films. However this one is the best. It has action, adventure, drama and comedy.",1
I'm gonna see it again!,1
"< br / > < br / > Well worth viewing. A very watchable film, and one which was eagerly awaited having seen the trailer a number of times. < br / > < br / > The real star of the show was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays Mr Chance ( a kind of 1740's chief of police ) with an evil glee that set him out from the rest of the cast.",1
It'great. .. is the Princess Bride meets... well Trainspotting.,1
But hey...,1
"What can I say? Everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them. He's always great to watch and for my money... an extremely underused actor. The idea is that after seeing the film, you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee. I certainly did. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role. This film is not going to tell you what the "" meaning of life "" is! Not as bad as many here have made it out to be. < br / > < br / > As for the rest of the film.... Every other actor in the movie delivered strong, solid performances. < br / > < br / > I was not disappointed in the least. Anybody who expected a clear - cut, by - the - numbers, connect the dots "" conclusion "" or "" answer "" at the end of the movie... CLEARLY wasn't watching the film closely enough!",1
"This mixed in with superb costumes and a few decent action scenes makes for a very enjoyable watch. ( However, the weak of stomach should really be warned of one or two scenes. )",1
Wow!,1
"of their first victim, lady Rebecca Gibson ( Tyler ). But Macleane falls in love with the niece / daughter (? ) Very entertaining.",1
"Unmissable. This is cheer - in - the - cinema stuff. The script is fast - moving and peppered with modern - day colloquialisms ; Merchant Ivory, this is not.",1
She is such a brilliant and beautiful actress! !,1
You won't forget this movie! Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.,1
This is for someone that wants to think and loves great film making. !,1
The soundtrack and setting added to the suspense perfectly. I did still enjoy the film immensely.,1
A quality movie all round.,1
"This is a very dark movie, somewhat better than the average Asylum film. < br / > < br / > I gave this movie a 8 / 10 because some clichés.",1
The ending is jaw dropping and you just know that a sequel would have to be made. A trip to madness. What is underneath the main plot? How can you end up like that?,1
I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. She is an excellent part to the film.,1
Dead Line certainly fits the bill. < br / > < br / > It is deep and horrifying.,1
"I find something really extraordinary in this film. Enjoy! But, anyway, it happens I make exceptions.",1
"I had real reservations before seeing this movie ( because of the cover ). I was wrong. < br / > < br / > Although there is a lot of scary parts, there is a lot of suspense and drama too. I was afraid that it would be excessively bloody and gory.",1
The characters in this movie are very real and believable. Although there were a few flaws ( what movie doesn't have flaws? They made all of the characters fit into a specific role. It's my number one favorite. I am just 18 years old and I can even relate to it. I absolutely loved this movie!,1
I definitely recommend it! He made that movie better for me. This movie is not that bad.,1
"The riddles are good, some are hard, some are not. Leave your mark, and will find you. I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school.",1
I highly do recommend this movie to all movie lovers! ! Very romantic... and surprisingly good!!,1
I never cry!,1
My biggest complaint is Chris Klein.,1
You are going to cry when you see this. All I have to say is that this movie is the bomb.,1
The producer and director came up with good idea and finally put an end to a film. Rich boy meets poor girl in'Mabels Diner'who is a waitress and local boy friend gets very upset and a fight starts out.,1
"First, the plot - - or actually just the setup - - is a kind of bastardization of Shakespeare's King Lear with the dying, crazy patriarch and the three scheming daughters who will inherit. Given five or six hours, perhaps Moorhouse could have made a movie more in keeping with Smiley's novel. < br / > < br / > I think I know why. And I guess "" Larry "" ( Jason Robards ) works for "" Lear. """,1
< br / > < br / > But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect! I started crying and couldn't stop until long after the movie ended.,1
"The writing's not that bad! Come on! < br / > < br / > If you loved the book, you will like the movie.",1
"! < br / > < br / > I would have to say that this movie will probably appeal more to women. < br / > < br / > It was a particularly AWFUL day today, weather - wise. I don't think I had ever even heard of it before. It poured rain all day, so I popped in this movie and shortly after I was mesmerized.",1
"< br / > < br / > This movie was thoroughly enjoyable, kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think.",1
"< br / > < br / > But on another note, who cares? Julie as a German Spy? Our Mary Poppins? The cinematography quite on the mark. They won't recognize you. ( Yawn ) < br / > < br / > But it has Julie - trying desperately to change her image. In fact it's quite entertaining.",1
I got a whole different viewpoint out of the film.,1
But sex abuse was not in our immediate family.,1
Maybe you are ready for it. I didn't focus on this fact until years later. I don't think this is well received in these times.,1
I certainly will never look at the play quite the same way again!,1
"That's when the plot of this film really beginning cooking. I gave it a rating of 9 out of 10. < br / > < br / > Hang in there, it is well worth the wait.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film then settles down into one of those early very "" talkie "", boring "" drawing room "" comedies. - the man is none other than Bob, her ex husband!!! Kitty is now a knockout and "" Bouccy "" has a job for her. Shock!! - and no one is the wiser.",1
"Neither tells anyone that they were married but it's obvious that her ex - wants the new and improved Norma back! The film begins with a dowdy housewife ( Norma Shearer ) finding out that her husband ( Rod La Rocque ) had been cheating on her. Three years pass and apparently they'd been divorced during these years due to the infidelity. Oddly, during this time, La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two kids as Shearer took them to Paris. My only real regret is that I didn't love the very end.",1
I would definitely love to see more of her work.,1
"This < br / > < br / > Three years later, Shearer is a glamorous and flirty divorcée. And, the ending is quite clever. < br / > < br / > Shearer and Dressler make this a cute, entertaining play. The cast uniformly fine. Shearer is stunned to discover the man is La Rocque, her ex - husband.",1
"< br / > < br / > Rod LaRocque doesn't come off too well as Shearer's adulterous husband. Quite popular during Silent days, the talkies were not especially kind to him and his career would suffer. Full of cranks & crotchets, she is very humorous. < br / > < br / > Magnificent Marie Dressler is on hand as an eccentric Long Island dowager.",1
For its time... a good show. Shearer and Dressler shine most.,1
I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. I recommend this one to all!,1
I found this one to be more chaotic than the average Stooges short ( as strange as that may sound ). Maybe if someone could explain these I'd appreciate this short more.,1
"), Ruth Hiatt as a whispering nurse, Billy Gilbert as ranting crazy patient, and "" Little Billy "" Rhodes as a feisty tiny patient. These guys are without a doubt the single most incompetent bunch of doctors to ever fumble their way across the screen.",1
Moe gives him a good smack.,1
This is definitely a classic.,1
"Though not a huge fan, I am a Three Stooges purist.",1
"If it is out on video / DVD, see it & enjoy it. This is one I could never forget.",1
"1, whenever I feel like it, I watch this! Now owning it on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Collection Vol.",1
< br / > < br / > I liked this short. One joke that is repeated more than once works every time. Just another fine short from the Three Stooges.,1
"Some producer's brother in law must have been on the Academy's voting board. "" May not be a fair comparison but I can see the Marx Bros. in this short.",1
"The game was on. ( It all plays out quite well, honest! ) This would go double for The 3 Stooges films. Only WOMAN HATERS, described in its credits as a'Musical Novelty'preceded it at Harry Cohen's Poverty Row sweatshop. Every type of gag was in evidence.",1
"First, it symbolizes all that the Stooges represent ; my daughter loves to repeat the announcement when she is in the middle of doing something silly.",1
I enjoyed the film score by Joel McNeely. I am big fan of underwater films. Mr. Hogan's performance perfectly offsets Elijah's role as Sandy. I feel Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. Mr. Butler is a very talented cinematographer. He portrayed Bounty Fisherman # 3 in this film.,1
Ren it!,1
So check it out!,1
"I was rather appalled to see the low rating this movie received here, personally considering it fun family fare. While there he befriends a dolphin named Flipper.",1
"Said patients are dangerously encouraged to act out their fantasies by Dr. Masters, which of course results in a rash of brutal killings.",1
I may be biased because I love dolphins. I like this movie.,1
But underwater shots definitely is best parts. Flipper is a nice heartwarming movie for whole family. < br / > < br / > Sorry for my bad English.,1
The affair btwn. The dance concert was beautiful.,1
See the movie you will love it. Both actresses are very true to their role. This is the key of the movie that made the movie. It is about love.,1
The gymnast is a film NOT to be missed. It will be coming soon to a festival near you. See this film! I will certainly purchase this when it becomes available on DVD.,1
"Held back. Basically it was just like any other love story, in any other life, with any other sexes. Sure, there were some difficult facts to face, and choices to make, but it just flowed.",1
Her friend showed me what a true friend really is. Someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets. I guess he doesn't really appreciate her. I fell in love with this movie. What a cozy a wonderful story! I could watch it over and over.,1
"The spare editing is accompanied by a beautiful, simple score. The shooting was very tastefully done ; very matter - of - fact. One has the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfold, not a voyeuristic sleaze film.",1
What an ending! Beautiful work and my applauds to all. Everyone who worked on this film did an AMAZING job. Thanks so much for making a great film!,1
It seems like the actors really got into their roles.,1
"< br / > < br / > The promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around Jane's accidental reunion with a former teammate. Serena is more elegant and artistic, although, obviously, also capable of incredible physical feats. The two women develop an act of the type performed by Cirque de Soleil. It will work on DVD, and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen. NOTE : Stay for the credits! < br / > < br / > Of the six films we saw at the Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival, we thought this one was the best. The Gymnast ( 2006 ) was written and directed by Ned Farr.",1
Its all so magical. That's what I love about movies.,1
"She was excellent and, my gaw, so beautiful.",1
This masterpiece will touch women and men alike.,1
Dreya Weber is an exquisite Jane. PS - great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women.,1
Unexpected and inspiring. You'll have to see for yourself. It is a brilliant celebration of Jane's choice. Nothing.,1
How the two end up involved is believable. I loved it!,1
And yet the approach wasn't heavy handed. I truly enjoyed this film. It was a real crowd please.,1
I love the show.,1
"It had more of a TV Show feel to it, which a lot of the "" Reality Shows "" have today. I was hooked and I wanted to see what new scheme they were going to cook up for each episode.",1
See this one for a good time! I thought the gore was a lot of fun too.,1
yes. Whether you say it's because I'm insane in the brain or not. You should buy it. I love love love this show.,1
"Phil : The guy who tries to be a good father, and finally, Bam : That son that never grew out of high school. I borrowed Season 1 from a friend last year, and I would give up my legs to meet the Viva La Bam Crew. April : The woman who wants to live life by the book and follow tradition. He's said in interviews that for majority of episodes, he isn't acting, and is just acting off instinct. He wanted Slayer to play in his backyard, MTV did it. < br / > < br / > If you liked Jackass, you'll fall in love with this. Another thing which is surprising to see, is how casual Margera is over the whole thing.",1
"While by no means a classic the directors involved do have an idea what suspense is. It has suspense, which is lacking from most horror movies today, and good acting by the cast. Overall I give this a 7 out of 10. The film is based upon popular urban legends and ghost stories.",1
I jumped a couple times. Loved it!,1
The first 2 stories are simply brilliant. I know it doesn't sound any special but it is Scary. ! The last story isn't scary but atleast not bad. It'about a biker and a ghosthouse. Rent this movie it is Good!! Man this is scary!!!,1
I immediately had to grab it. The only problem I have is that since it wasn't released in theatres I guess I'll never be able to view it in widescreen. You should definitely take a chance and rent this one. Some of the plot I don't understand but once I watch it again I bet I'll get it.,1
"This time, though the characters still don't know what's going on, we do, and this provides the horror. < br / > < br / > The opening sequence is pure, fast - paced urban myth. I figured that if I didn't like its more acclaimed, bigger < br / > < br / > The second tale is more suspense. No need for cheap thrills here. It was intriguing, masterfully scripted and logical in a way I Know What You Did Last Summer could only dream of. Finally, it held its focus and finished with a flurry while Scream fizzled and died. This is the true ghost story of the trio.",1
This movie is so awesome!,1
Wow! It scared me most of all stories. It is about a guy who is driving around the country on a motorcycle. I didn't even dare to go up and take the videotape out of the VCR!,1
Watch it for a thrill and shock to your system.,1
"This one is a keeper - - Jim Bob says check it out. A real discovery. Joyeux Samhai! Caught this flick as one of a five - for - $ 5 deal from a local video store, and it was a most pleasant surprise.",1
"Movie is not available on DVD, but can be found on VHS. Solid acting and a few truly "" scary "" moments make this an above - average chiller.",1
But there's very cool twist at the end. The reason i brought the film was because of Christine Taylor and the love for horror films. The cast who play theses characters are great. < br / > < br / > The film has a great cast as you can see from IMDb. Everything about this film is just perfect. They just talk about the couple who they've crashed into. basically a pervert enters her house and things go creepy.,1
"Luckily, this is not one of the main stories and only lasts maybe 5 minutes. They're traveling around in an RV headed to Las Vegas. < br / > < br / > The third story, "" People Can Lick Too "" is my personal favorite. < br / > < br / > The second story, "" The Honeymooners "" is, eh, okay. This story has a pretty good setup, but just merely an'ok'delivery. Trouble is, that internet buddy? Set in It's about - you guessed it - two people on their honeymoon!",1
!,1
"The lack of money shows, ( Does anyone care too much? )",1
"Build a fire and tell scary stories. The Hook. "" OK, this was not the best of the 4. Very good plot twist. But they do it real good in this movie. People Can Lick Too. """,1
"< br / > < br / >'The Locket ', however, was the unarguable masterpiece of this film. As he's driving along, a storm breaks out, and he's forced to find shelter in the house of a mute girl.",1
"7 / 10. It's a great anthology of some classic urban legends, and the whole film was tied together neatly. It is much better than what one would expect. The first story was alright, and the motorhome sequence near the end was a little creepy. The film begins with the classic "" Hook "" story, and then we're introduced to the group of friends driving home from the concert.",1
"< br / > < br / > People can Lick Too - this is probably the scariest and most dark of the stories. After they decide to build a campfire in the woods, they begin to tell their spooky stories and the movie transitions to the events in the stories. This was good but it was the weakest of the entries. And it turned out to be quite a good little horror surprise! I decided to watch this on FearNet on demand for free because I figured well, nothing else looks enjoyable. ( I won't spoil that for you! ) This was really chilling.",1
The four stories are well - paced and satisfying. It is also a film that exceeded the ( low ) expectations I had.,1
"In addition to this, the ending of the tale will completely shock you! 'Campfire Tales'certainly does not fit into that category. < br / > < br / > This film certainly did that job well! Find a copy and watch it... if you dare! This campfire setting has a mysterious plot in itself. ).",1
"I DIDNT MAKE SENSE. I will rate the movie per segment of films. Here is the scare - o - meter. It had suspense, and not too gory. < br / > < br / > - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( Very Good ) < br / > < br / > 4 ) Ghost Tale ( Man kisses ghost )?? The actors were famous but not TOO famous.",1
"I would like to say that I absolutely loved Campfire Tales! To me, it was one of the original horror flicks with a twisted ending. I will not hesitate to get my copy on that day.",1
"The weakest segment is "" The Hook "", with Eddie and Jenny, but the other stories a great. However, Jessica is actually a psychopath. My vote is seven. When the man returns from his herd, Scott finds the truth about Heather.",1
He was perfectly cast as well. He has hustler written all over him. When he did Marilyn impersonation that should have told the wife everything. The young man was gay to the hilt!,1
"Check it out... Several of the "" twists "" felt a little too forced and I could have used a tad more blood, but I really dug this much too under - rated blend humor and horror. Widely known as "" Don't Look in the Basement "" - this is pure 70s horror, B - movie goodness that could actually pass as the genre's version of "" One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest "".",1
WTF!?,1
Ignore amanita hooey.,1
I thought it was very well done. But I'm not spoiling anything. I really loved this movie. The plot was very deep and intriguing. It was like I couldn't look away.,1
i miss Rickman's sexy English accent ( luckily he slips into it and out of the American pattern ). disappointing but with some great acting.,1
"< br / > < br / > And for that and the very last scene... this is one of my favorite movies ever. But the ending made up for the entire film. < br / > < br / > Only the wife eats the mushroom. I was really surprised, honestly. < br / > < br / > This film is interesting, to say least.",1
"The intrigue and drama, not quite as much. < br / > < br / > The ending definitely makes this movie worth watching.",1
I saw Dark Harbor at the'98 Seattle Film Festival.,1
"I don't know, this might actually be my all - time favorite horror movie. Perhaps the new nurse will know what to do, then again, perhaps not. Giving away more would do more harm than good. Ten minutes into movie, and things are looking really ugly. none of them seem all that dangerous, only delusional.",1
You have to watch it twice at least.,1
"or "" Was that intentional? "" < br / > < br / > When you see this movie, see it at least twice. If you like mysteries ( namely Hitchcock ) you'll like this movie. Twice. This one does. The first time I saw this film, I wanted to like it for so many reasons, but I simply did not. It just seemed a little dull. So just see it. I like movies that make me think. ( The wonderful voice makes up for the weird accent though. )",1
I'm tired boring and ordinary movies. Certainly didn't see it coming!! Actors knew what they were doing.,1
"Okay, so this wasnt what I was expecting. But when I watched it I realized that it was very funny. So if you like to laugh rent this one. But, this film had B - movie all over it.",1
"Some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure. But Jack Frost 2 won't go over well with some people. The next woman fell on a bed of icicles. "". Well, you have to see it for yourself.",1
"They say that Sam's DNA combined with Jack Frost's. Now he is immune to anti - freeze. Hence, here's my point. 7 out of 10. The screenplay was, was also atrocious. The first one was better though. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie. Since the main character is allergic to bananas, Jack Frost is too.",1
"< br / > < br / > This movie has it all. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with him. Yes, killer snowballs. YARRR! And finally, Captain Fun. This is the sequel to Jack Frost, a movie about a killer snowman. like babies.",1
"< br / > < br / > The lack of "" memorable quotes "" disturbs me. But you have to understand, IT'S NOT A HORROR MOVIE. Jack Frost 2 is neither of these.",1
Dare i say osca winner. This is a perfect date movie.,1
"If you liked JACK FROST, then you will like this sequel. They looked like hand puppets. Seeing old friends and meeting new characters.",1
"Don't Look in the Basement "" is definitely worth watching for all fans of 1970s drive - films. This movie has a campy atmosphere around it that no other film I have ever seen has been able to capture.",1
This is better then the first.,1
"< br / > < br / > Bottom line incredible movie, rent it. "".",1
"This movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt. Okay, I'll say it. It certainly worked for me.",1
"< br / > < br / > But I saw that it was based on a book by Kenneth Oppel. Sometimes good things happen by accident. Rather, they have palms like human hands, but the fingers are longer and have webs of skin between them. When I read the first book, I was left wondering "" Is that it? """,1
"I haven't read any of books, but I intend to. Well, that's all I have to say. Mine is Shade, and my second favorite is Marina.",1
"If you are looking for a war film with a lot of blood and guts, this would not be it. I was deeply impressed with the character he played.",1
It is great historical story telling.,1
It is characteristic that this film is not better known. Straightforward honest images of an intense beauty. < br / > < br / > A silver dollar in a heap of nickel!,1
Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson form the heart of the piece in what is a well - chosen cast.,1
8 out of 10. A nurse travels to a rural psychiatric clinic run by Doctor Stephens.,1
"Thought provoking, humbling depiction of the human tragedies of war.",1
"They seem to have used natural lighting, but whatever they used works beautifully. The actors act 19th century, not like 20th century people in old clothes. "" Nothing happens the way Hollywood would write it ; this movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares about quality film and the telling of history. The rest of the cast is quite capable, and fill their roles in well. Pharaoh's Army "" defies formula. The result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast, with a heavy emotional current. Tensions broil and relationships are made and broken.",1
"Nothing more than a joke was Tim Curry'performance of the drug king Damian : a phony caricature, too "" eeeevil "" and just too ridiculous to be true. I. T.!",1
I'd never heard of it until I saw it at a mates.,1
< br / > < br / > High recommended. How on earth this film isn't more widely regarded is beyond me.,1
!,1
Have your tea and biscuits ready!,1
"B. C sitcom'Keeping Up Appearances '. Fair enough, it wasn't clever, but that was the whole point.",1
"I found it sad though when likes of Ben Elton took against both this and Benny Hill. but also enjoyed conventional stuff such as this. < br / > < br / > The'alternative comedy'boom was good in many ways, but had a dark side. And they are not remotely funny either. It was certainly not'dreadful lazy comedy '. Take a look at the latest T. V. schedules. All soaps and reality dross. It was funny and well performed, and that was enough! If nothing else, it provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to.",1
"And mine - and I was a huge fan of "" The Young Ones "", too! I used to enjoy "" Happy Ever After "", but was absolutely hypnotised by "" Terry & June "". Wonderful!",1
You will be surprised at Flynn's comedy timing. If you haven't seen this movie please give a look. Eleanor Parker at her physical peak. The dialog is fast and very witty. A true comedy.,1
a fine romantic comedy. eleanor is also easy on the eyes. the comedic writing on this film is excellent.,1
"Also, the supporting cast is wonderful as well. ! It's nice to see Errol playing a father as well. This movie is a hidden gem. And their chemistry is impeccable.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film begins with a lengthy exchange between Flynn and his daughter, played by a lispy Patti Brady. NEVER SAY GOODBYE concerns the divorced couple, Flynn and Parker, and their mutual desire to remarry. This was the third time I tried to watch this film.",1
"Eleanor Parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued, and little Patti Brady charms as Tucker's actual pen - pal friend. All ultimately works out well, naturally, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery. It is Tucker, though, who "" tucks "" the movie under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the goal line.",1
Out of his various forays into the genre this is certainly the best.,1
"I love Cid, I think he's cute. Overall I gave this movie a 9, because yes, I loved it. This movie is based on the game series : Final Fantasy.",1
!,1
they were truly amazing. ! gorgeous!! ),1
But I wouldn't entirely spoil the show for you. Then I headed off to YouTube. I found it. Get the DVD now! Cloud's OmniSlash couldn't be better.,1
< br / > < br / > Watch it!! ! I really love this movie!!,1
The music supports the movie completely. I was completely blown away! The characters are incredible.,1
"I LOVED IT! ! 5 / 10 Everything else, great. Story 9. This movie was great!!",1
"I buy the DVD because is EXCELLENT, IS 100 % ADVISABLE, if you don't see this film, what you waiting for?",1
"And being an amateur at graphics and animation ( self teaching myself through books. I generally like this movie a lot. For those who are curious on the same matter, I use the program Gmax by Discreet.",1
"Thank goodness for wikpedia. All told there were about 15 kids in all... Hmmmm... I am someone who has never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a series fan. This movie was definitely scripted with FF VII fans ONLY in mind. If you are a video game or Sci - Fi fan this movie is a pretty good flick, but like a previous review said, it comes off like a 90 minute fight scene.",1
"The movie is really cool, I thought. The way they make the characters look is almost like they're real people.",1
""", and I cannot blame him. BUT there's a but. Excellent graphic, excellent music, excellent dubbing, excellent action sequences and so on...",1
"< br / > < br / > The music is typical Uematsu quality, which means its top notch. Want to watch it and love it? When's the last time you've seen an excellent movie based on a video game? Don't bother. Well, this is it. Buy the game, beat it and then watch it. Impressive. Cait Sith sounds less cute than I imagined, but worked very well. Haven't played the game?",1
"And boy, are those going to be happy fans when they see this movie! < br / > < br / > See this movie. Bye. It was, like, totally what I intended. I mean, they are some of the best ever createdERIOD. They didn't try to please everyone and instead focused exclusively on Final Fantasy 7 fans. Square really landed this one.",1
"Just watched it then. I like that approach ; you get caught up in the mystery and confusion that all the characters are going through. But like I said, just be accepting.",1
"And it does so very subtly. Characters move with fluidity. Each scene background comes to life and tells its own story. < br / > < br / > In short, if you enjoyed the music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this film will blow you out of the water. Like a dance. The movie relies on the audience's knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements. Yeah.",1
This movie is simply gorgeous. A true feast for the eyes.,1
"'Don't'is his undisputed masterpiece. ' Mad genius.ccept no substitute. In summary they really don't come any more esoteric than this - well, actually they do, track down Brownrigg's'Keep My Grave Open '. There is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing.",1
"The game was so extravagant with the In effect, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. < br / > < br / > Sound - 10 / 10 The sound was fabulous. When the action scenes came about, they were, for lack of a more accurate word, a roller - coaster. And so, I'm reviewing this movie from a FF7 fan perspective, and with no regret. < br / > < br / > Story - 7 / 10 The story and characters would be the main flaws of the movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > We all know you can't put a FFVII in 1. Some were not. AC is clearly for FFVII players / fans and doesn't honestly try to be anything else. Action that is. If you don't let the story in, it's no wonder it seems sloppy. Especially characters talk so much more with their facial expressions than ever before. And trust me when I say there's a lot of it. There is little to none realism in it outside FFVII world which serves the purpose.",1
It is a great ST and I was not disappointed. I loved every second of this movie. The action was necessary as much as people complained. 5 / 10 - don't think they could of expanded it that much more.,1
"I'm glad I preordered the OST. The most stunning things were definitely NOT given away in the trailers. Oh, and we finally get to see exactly how one equips Materia... < br / > < br / > Music : brilliant also. Graphics : brilliant, obviously. I wouldn't call it a weak plot, but it's nowhere near as convoluted as the game's plot was. < br / > < br / > I admit, I was kind of hoping that this movie would bring FF7 to a wider range of people, but this is NOT a mainstream movie. I was a bit nervous about it, since ( from what I've seen ) Nobuo isn't the best at writing music to go along with action ( remember the Steal the Tiny Bronco sequence? Fight sequences move extremely fast, but after watching a couple of them your eyes should be used to it and it won't seem so confusing.",1
""" Duckman "" is a great show. Great job, Klasky - Csupo!",1
Rated TV - 14 for Sexual Content and Language.,1
"Perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the USA, "" Duckman "" runs short at 70 episodes in four seasons. I doubt it will ever be on DVD though. Far too many things the Duck said make much more sense today. < br / > < br / > One can't avoid feeling sorry for him and his lucid madness.",1
And the delivery of the jokes are rapid - fire a lot of the time in the better episodes.,1
"He's a private detective, a widower, a peeping tom, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a murderer, a ( fill in the blank ). You name it, Duckman has done it. Nothing will ever surpass it. It's a wonderful, highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish",1
"No one is happy in the film, even if they believe that they are. ( However, "" O "" does find a sense of happiness with her young admirer ). The VHS print was a little faded looking, but I was very haunted by what I had watched. Did it all make sense? Another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. She cannot let that vision go.",1
Note to horror filmmakers : some of us do like subtlety! ... but you probably have seen it or else you wouldn't be here. This is a gem and is my absolute favorite TRUE HORROR movie. Betty Chandler is a knockout and I am shocked that this is her only film credit ).,1
I know movie amended the darker ending of the play - and I am not saying I missed the murder part. But I surely needed to see those two getting their comeuppance somehow and I was left groaning in frustration with the ending. ( It's why I gave it only a 9 ) < br / > < br / > But definitely an interesting film.,1
"David Boreanaz is Keith. YEAH!! "", it's hard to see them as a victim of rape. It's sexy and original, and quite entertaining.",1
"The other two younger male characters were good too, without being overbearing. This is a great movie.",1
I am really amazed how little fame this film had. it's nice and cute and gives good time.,1
Everything is very realistic and relate - able for anybody living in a small town with little prospects. There wasn't a moment where i thought that it was unbelievable.,1
"Dialogue was sharp, quick and flowed nicely.",1
"Lisa ( Holly Lewis ) will be going away to a Christian school after the summer. I think the quality I liked most about it was that it seemed rather realistic. This information was actually confirmed by the director himself John Hazlett at the Q & A after the film. Going into the movie, I knew very little about it and just took a chance on it because the film's plot sounded interesting. So as I entered the theater just hours ago I wondered what the final verdict would be thumbs up or thumbs down. Go figure. Not to mention that all the actresses in this film are way over 18 in real life.",1
I had the pleasure of watching this two chairs down from ( one of? ),1
"This film is outstanding! But, Paulina's Dallas steals the show i think. Love, friendship, sex and violence in a terrific mix.",1
"Violent, but not too much so.",1
Little chumps like this have ruined the world of film. One more little note. It's Campy. Try to find the longest cut you can. The flute - sitar - rattle box soundtrack is classic. Maybe there all drunk.,1
Truly a great film...,1
"I must admit - I love it! I saw this movie yesterday. It's like early Tarantino, but better.",1
It's like a video game brought to life. You never know who's behind the door or what will happen next.,1
The rest of the cast performs very well too. I saw this movie by accident while in Paris.,1
Here's a director one should keep one's eye on.,1
"humor. I loved this film! A solid, intense, hard - core and suspenseful movie that has just the right touch of ( dark? )",1
"Is Thursday an original film? Heck no, but it is a lot of fun!",1
"If you are a fan of cheap 70'sleaze than this is the film for you! It seems Dr. Masters, a rather ambitious female doctor, has taken over his duties and begun to implement her own ideas.",1
How old is he anyway? It really seems unbelievable. < br / > < br / > Thursday is the best Quentinesque movie I've seen.,1
"Thursday utilises a few characters mostly within a single location. The scene is soaked with dark humour and witty dialogues, and that is carried on throughout the rest of the movie. The acting is decent enough, with the entire cast clearly having fun with this plot. Thursday is a very funny film, and scenes such as the ones that see the adoption visitor turn up at an awkward time ensure that the film is difficult to dislike.",1
hey community!,1
"There are Nick, his girlfriend, Dallas, and their partner Billy Hill. The people we are about to meet are not nice guys. Dallas has decided to seduce Casey at all costs. Jarvis, who is aroused ends up leaving in a huff. With her it's a matter of principle. At this time, Dallas makes an entrance. They are drug dealers.",1

"Much as Deliverance will always be remembered for it's awful rape of Ned Beatty, Thursday will go down as movie where a woman forcibly rapes an unwilling man. Unforgettable. < br / > < br / > ONE BAD THING : The title makes people think it is somehow related to ( or derivative of ) the "" Friday "" series of films featuring Ice Cube. ONE GOOD THING : This hidden treasure of a crime drama is incredibly entertaining from beginning to end.",1
"I had a pretty good time watching it. Particularly effective is poetry - quoting, dotty old Mrs. Callingham. The inmates don't take too kindly to Charlotte, either.",1
The acting also is good. I score it 7 / 10.,1

"Anyways, the story isn´t really too much to talk about, but i think it´s ok. But i must say i was positively surprised. I don´ know. The first few minutes are almost the most funny of the whole movie. I rate it 7 / 10. A final battle in some way. The store clerk from India is just too funny!",1
This film is hard to knock.,1

"She doesn't know a thing. There is a scene that involves torturing that has even the same dialogue as in Tarantino's'Reservoir Dogs '. < br / > < br / > Still, it is a good movie. The opening sequence to begin with, is quite impressive. Casey has flushed those down the drain.",1
"This in fact sets what i think is the general tone for the movie. Tom Jane is good in this, and deserves the recognition he will now hopefully get thanks to the The Punisher. OK, so this film is NOT very well known, and wasn't very well publicised.",1
"Also I'd have to thank Skip Woods for being so imaginative and original. I saw this film for the second time last night and I really enjoyed it ( again ). A great story and good actors. It ranks very high up there in my crime flick list among Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, Pulp Fiction and Snatch. Brutal, sexual, offensive???",1
"For those unfamiliar with Paddy Chayefsky, this is a very good introduction.",1
It's a hilarious and serious movie.,1

< br / > < br / > An 8 out of 10. Diana Rigg is attractive and quite the complicated young woman. Best performance = George C. Scott. Seek this out!,1
He even beats and rapes a hippie 3 times. Another black comedy that won an Oscar for Best Screenplay.,1
I can watch it every week & still find something new.,1
I give it a 7. It's not laugh out loud humor - - it's VERY black humor. PLOT SPOILERS!!!! Also there's a killer roaming the hospital. I personally had trouble taking this seriously.,1
The thing about him is that he is depressed. Great movie. Dr. Bock teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it.,1
Thanks for help... Kind regards... I own a beta max recording with FRENCH language.,1
It is that superb.,1
"! The opening 10 minutes ( pre - credits ) are great and so is the completely deranged climax. The lunatics have taken over the asylum, yeah!",1
"Unfortunately, there is a sub - plot of Scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient. The Hospital is a movie that was made ahead of its time. This is where credibility of picture becomes strained. With the nurses and aids, it's the same story. The patient has been murdering people at the hospital.",1
"It is not a pretty picture. I loved this movie. And yet, you really believe that this is a hospital.",1
"George C. Scott is Dr. Block, one of the heads of the Manhattan Surgical Center, a major teaching hospital.

Patty Chayevsky was years ahead of most successful screenplay and drama writers in tackling sticky subjects. < br / > < br / > Hughes'daughter ( Diana Rigg ) wants to bring the comatose dad back to his home on an Apache Indian Reservation in Mexico. Scott is not totally opposed to the idea - after all, hospital errors almost killed Hughes. < br / > < br / > As a person who has recently been to a hospital too many times ( and will shortly have to return again ) I find THE HOSPITAL a very timely and rewarding satire.",1

"( Barnard Hughes ). Scott replied, he possessed inside him a burning fire which drove him. This was not the case when he starred in the movie, "" The Hospital. """,1
But will she save him? Hollywood did something right for a change. Less than 10 years later. Same scripter.,1
All of the acting is first - rate. Absolutely corrosive!,1
That includes the staff of The Hospital. That's where the comedy comes in. Still his handling of the role is unforgettable. < br / > < br / > But first he's got a real problem.,1
He plays a burned - out chief of medicine on the most chaotic day he or his hospital have ever seen.,1
"Low - budget but memorable would - be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre. A young patient named Allyson gives the term "" nymphomaniac "" new meaning. First we have the delusional woman who thinks her baby doll is real. There isn't much plot going on, but the cheapness works for the movie.",1
"I was not disappointed. His work there had instructed me as to his genius, so when'Hospital'appeared on TMC, I was anxious to see it.",1
"Certainly the highlight of this film is it's cast. < br / > < br / > Diana Rigg, George C. Scott, Bernard Hughes to mention a few. < br / > < br / > I loved every minute, and was delighted to see it out on DVD.",1
The acting is superb. Well worth seeing again and again. or 6th.,1
"Lloyd tells her to go to the club called the losers to see Jeri about a job. Nikki is on her way to meet with her girl friends Michele and Jackie. I give this movie 10 wease stars for two reasons.

Recommended.,1
Pepe LePew cartoon. A must see!,1
C'est l'amour!,1
Pepé mistakes the poor cat for a female skunk and pursues him thinking his protestations are just shyness.,1
Pepe Le Pew can either really creep you out or totally sweep you off your feet.,1
"At least on the fun level. Children at play. And I really did find them funny. I love it. ! Highly entertaining at all angles. Just a few loose wires. Nuts are humans too. Now who could resist that? No, HILARIOUS!",1
The main theme and relations with other characters are a bit complex. Which is not here. It is worth watching.,1
The acting is surprisingly good.,1
"But I confess I almost did it. Actually, it's almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie. Writing about something so wonderful is completely hard. And that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart. Three are the main characters. Imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands?",1
"This movie isn't about homosexuality, but it IS about sexuality. ( I doubt it ). It's a confusing story, but it IS beautiful nonetheless. < br / > < br / > Aihara, an aloof girl, will definitely make the viewers ponder who IS behind the aloof girl.",1
Enjoy!,1
The emotions are genuine.,1

Some consider the low budget a liability, but in the case And, what exactly happened to Dr. Stephens?",1

"The plot has been thoroughly summarized by other posters, so I won't cover the same ground. Thanks!",1
"Hence, the casting job on this film was perfect. Why can't we make films like this any more. He makes such a good headmistress.",1
But where are art houses?,1
And so did the audience for this movie. Who else would search for flick?,1
The precursor to the entire series is a charming film called'The Happiest Days Of Your Life'( 1950 ).,1
First thing's first. Like Casper Van Dean gets some work. 187 likes drugs. Not gunna say that was the craziest thing in this movie. We find out Erika's character is a police bot. And thank god really. Dracula told Orlock he'll be right back. I have a theory though.,1
"Truly an emotional roller - coaster from start to finish. I rented this movie not knowing what to expect but WHOA was I in for a treat! Writing, acting, filming and directing - all top notch. And Coolio as a vampire.... very nice! Brilliant!",1
"However, IMDb has "" adjusted "" ( dumbed down? ) 6.",1
The script is so personable - and that cast!!! (! ) A real find! That film! Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor SO well! So many levels..!,1
"< br / > < br / > Why is this film so memorable? And then, the acting is just so amazing. Even if they were far from perfect?",1
"Also superb are Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence as Danilo's parents, as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith. You won't be disappointed. The cast is uniformly superb. Metzler and Huddleston subtle performances could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co - stars, but they are excellent and help anchor the film. I first encountered Arthur Penn's "" Four Friends "" late one night on HBO.",1
A wonderful movie about people. It can also be quite dramatic.,1
< br / > < br / > This film was ( unjustly ) maligned on its release. And Lois Smith is very interesting in her role.,1
"tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a backdrop. ... that maybe someday people will wake up to. < br / > < br / > The "" Forrest Gump "" comparison is a good one.",1
The chills just jump right off the screen. Is Dr. Masters all she seems to be? AXE is another cheap film that is looked down upon.,1
High recommended! Something I have never done for another film.,1
? ! - - that captures the essence of the 60s experience ( and I was there! ),1
"This is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally released. The entire cast did an incredible job and it's by far the best work of Jodi Thelen's career. Hard to explain, but it is something that must be experienced.",1
What a great movie! ! Definite a must see for drama fans.,1
"I'm not ashamed to admit it. We know the events ; we don't need to dwell on them again. He never smiles. It's a film of many moods and textures. At the train station, we meet the man. The movie takes us throughout the Sixties.",1
"< br / > < I would love to see more of these folks, especially Zeke Rippy. This is a better and more solid movie than most of the independents I watch all year long. Poorly understood perhaps. I don't know the inside story, but it would probably make a good movie.",1
"Civilized to savage, basically. Thus, at the time this review was submitted, is most likely the reason for lower rating on IMDb. I can understand people becoming upset and thinking they were fooled by that summary, seeing the apocalyptic intro but then experiencing a dark drama. After going too far in'teaching a lesson'to one of their own, a death occurs and each person tries to save his / her own standing.",1
"Zeke Rippy ( Mic ) is great, you totally believe his character.",1
"Get out! "".",1
I thoroughly enjoyed every one of them.,1
I've fallen in love once. My favorite country star is from Kansas. Its such a good movie.,1

"Think of Justin, and John. Anna ( Lexi Randall ) is a beautiful young lady, working for a physician in town. It's a shame, don't you think? "" probably more ill than we know. Time moves on. Sarah talking to Jacob said, "" It's all so fragile, this life. I could have died in that blizzard.",1
"And finally, Jack Palance, as the long lost Witting patriarch, is as fine as ever.",1
It was a wonderful story. I finished watching those this week.,1
"This movie didn't have that, but it had the best story. The only sub - par performance was by one of the kids. < br / > < br / > Highly recommended.",1
It is surprisingly funny. A must see. The execution of the story line is excellent! This is all packaged with visually engaging animation.,1
There is never a dull moment from start to finish. 65. That's not the case here. The mind melting climax at the end that is just unbelievable. For me that just ads to the fun of watching this type of stuff.,1
This is one movie I didn't want to see end. Great job.,1
"Excellent work, Mr. Anderson!",1
Well done. Horses on Mars does this and more.,1
So it is with HORSES ON MARS. Nothing beats the grandeur of the big screen.,1
These choices were obviously not an accident. It is quite a beautiful film!,1
"With the two girls'help, you can probably guess what happens from there! Having previously seen this short on VHS tape with the feature Summer Stock, I just rewatched Every Sunday on the TCM site. Contrasts are marked not only with Garland's and Durbin's musical choice but also with their height, poise, and movement.",1
Events unfold and the next Sunday Judy and Deanna save the day. I'm only child.,1
"She was smart enough to get out at the top and make it stick. < br / > < br / > So, in their salad days, Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland.",1
"All the way through, the music, acting and scenery were absolutely stunning.",1
"< br / > < br / > The story is simple enough. Well, that day comes, and to their surprise, hardly anyone comes as the music starts. Ms. Durbin's operatic voice blends well with Ms. Garland's natural one creating a lovely duet. Felix Feist directed this one which was a way to promote the two talented stars to the public.",1
"< br / > < br / > Dafydd a Hugh Honestly, I enjoyed it.",1
"Certainly, it would make perfect sense that MGM would want to favor one of its'own contract players over another from a rival studio. By the time EVERY Sunday was produced in July, 1936, Deanna Durbin's contract with MGM had already lapsed and she had been immediately signed by Universal a month earlier, in June 1936.",1
It reminds me of'Romy and Michele's High School Reunion '. The cast is also charming. I'm very surprised that so many people don't like this movie.,1
"I doubt it ). There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie, although it IS a tad predictable.",1
Go see it if you already haven't!,1
You'll see what I mean.,1
This was one of Molly funniest performances and best.,1
"So, begrudgingly, I will rate it a 7. Her journey toward cooldom, as well as her falling in love with a teacher, is the story. ARGH! I am a bigger Drew Barrymore fan than she is. Women will like this movie better than men.",1
Rent this movie.,1
When will it be available on DVD??? Since it was lampooned in S. O. It is lovely to look at and listen to.,1
I thought all the actors did a great job with their characters. This movie is appropriate for anyone and a good way to while away 2 hours. All these people who say it is bad are too uptight and critical!,1
"And even when she goes back to high - school and sheds those things. Of course it's sappy, of course it's predictable. It was funny and sweet. We all know the fairytale. Anyway, I won't get into it.",1
Never Been Kissed'is a real feel good film. !,1
"and whoa, high school life. i love this movie. be honest! remember it?",1
"< br / > < br > But she's never been hip, never been cool, never been popular until now!",1
"There are a lot of films about teenagers. However, it's not lifelike.",1
"God tells us true faith is the freedom to choose truth. And so it was. We show the world a smiling face. "" What a difference that would make!",1
"Why all the bad reviews. Again, the movie was amazing. One of Drew's best. I also loved the ending.",1
"< br / > < br / > This movie did have the perfect happy ending, as it did bring tears to my mum and sister eyes.",1
It always makes me cry. I love this movie so much. Every single time.,1
"Only problem is Josie has never been popular. I also enjoyed Leelee Sobiesky as intellectual student who befriends Josie on her first day at the school. Example - the reggae bar scene. It is however, very sweetly done.",1
< br / > < br / > With Drew though it's an assignment. She's a copy editor for the Chicago Sun Times who yearns to be a reporter. Go back to high school and make some necessary corrections. I've known a few in my life who would go back and stay if they could. What's a girl to do?,1
I have the DVD.,1
< br / > < br / > It rates a 7.,1
"< br / > < br / > All over - I loved it. < br / > < br / > Drew Barrymore is a great actress, and this role suited her really well at the time.",1
and Josie's boss is fantastic.,1
I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted.,1
I LOVED this movie.,1
Nothing ground breaking about this but it certainly isn't ludicrous. This movie should be remade for the big screen - I'd love it and I'd be the first one in line. Seeing that Dinosaur with modern day special effects stalking those guys would be great!,1
on all sorts of dinosaurs.,1
"Then they will fear us. "" Then they will hate us.",1
Haven't seen it in a few years for some reason these classics fade from cable TV. amazing how some things stick in your mind after 30 years. on a Friday night.,1
"It succeeds at doing both. The Last Dinosaur is a film that is meant to be fun and exciting. It stands a little too up - right like Godzilla does and it drags its tail, so it is a guy in a suit. < br / > < br / > Also I liked the characters in this film. Drilling to a prehistoric area is something that seems could really happen.",1
"If bad movies are your thing, definitely get this one. This movie epitomizes the'so bad it's good'genre of films. Stupidly beautiful. When the'triceratops'gets killed, watch how it falls.",1
"Sure the dinosaurs were guys in suits ( A Triceratops with front knees! ) Tsuburaya's FX people did their job in style here and aside from a few dodgy matte shots, they do their job well. It plays a lot like the films The Land Unknown ( 1956 ) and The Land That Time Forgot ( 1975 ) in feel and pace.",1
Or what about Daniel's acting?,1
"Prepare to meet your Messiah - they call him Masten Thrust. < br / > < br / > Not to be denied his own ballad, Thrust's song shamelessly praises him and his manliness. Even BMTG banned artist Clay Aiken could belt out those lyrics and become an rump - kicking machine.",1
"Though it was a primitive release, it did get the compositions right.",1
"The piece was Christ and the two thieves, however Christ was long ago sold off. Definitely better than any of its myriad of schlocky titles makes it seem. From that point on it becomes a battle for the girls soul.",1
"The poor Danila, from now on, will suffer torments of hell. if you've really got a sense of humor. of a small Italian town screaming her heart out. The face shows infinite torment. Danila is impressed by the mastery shown by the sculptor - the statue seems almost alive! She lives with her parents. Luigi Pistilli is a very good exorcist. The statue dates from the 15th century. His performance is, as usual, intense.",1
Good on him. Mostly due to his gift of evil looks. Watch it to get the details.,1
The scene is when the crucifix comes alive. < br / > < br / > This is one of the most frustrating movies ever. It goes nowhere fast as it tries to emulate ( badly ) THE EXORCIST. Boring.,1
"And yes, the clown is pretty cute too.",1
"But, I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, she does make some bad decisions, but that was to be expected. I liked the whole alternate reality / dream state that played into the movie. I enjoyed the main character Sai. I'm putting this one on my guilty pleasure list.",1
I gave this movies a 7 out of 10. I loved it.,1
"Ben then meets Evie, who he makes a very special bond with. This movie is a great film.",1
"It was a great twist from the average, played out vampire movie. I loved this movie!",1
"The special effects make up and creature effects were well done, and the set design of the vampire's dimension was very effective. I caught this movie on the Horror Channel and was quite impressed by the film's Gothic atmosphere and tone. There are some analogies to drug addiction and loss of control, and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle.",1
Recommended. Do not expect to like any of the characters.,1
"In truth, there are no good guys or bad guys in this film. Archie ( Norman Reedus ) has been released from prison and has nothing to lose. I was, personally, blown away by how good this film was.",1
Norman Reedus's performance is cool. < br / > < br / > The director has done a great work. I watched this movie on HBO and I had a good time. Hehe.,1
"Don't count him out, however, for he turns out to be smart than anyone gave him credit for. This oddball film is worth a look.",1
"She complains to "" Archie "" ( Reedus ) how terrible her life is, and how he could help her get out of it. < br / > < br / > My 8 / 10 score is mostly for plot. I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.",1
Overall this movie definitely doesn't deserve the B - grade tag. This one surprised me.,1
< br / > < br / > Give it a chance - it's a really fun film. Probably because I couldn't quit figure out exactly who was hustling who.,1
The film involves the viewer from the start.,1
"I thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors. At first, it is just a way for him to earn some money. I, being a fan of Rupert Grint, rented this film a few months ago.",1
"I had never heard of anybody in it except Armand Assante. good show. The ending was a real twist, totally unexpected, which I liked. It is only later in the movie that it all comes together.",1
"It is absolutely adorable. In other words, don't overlook this show, just because you're over the age of three!",1
My girls 4 and 6 love this show. When Nana reads a story it is slow and she talks about each page with Mona.,1
"A more in depth history of the Rom people would have been nice. < br / > < br / > However, viewer was not guided enough. What makes the movie great is the music and the scenery. The songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented.",1
There is no need of narration.,1
"Everything they do is expressed with music. Dance is another important activity. Latcho Drom, or Safe Journey, is the second film in Tony Gatlif's trilogy of the Romany people.",1
"If there is a more deeply spiritual, flowing homage to the sound and movement gypsy cultures, it has yet to be filmed.",1
"But above any anthropological argument, this is a work of great beauty, strong colors and wonderful singing and dancing. This is not "" direct cinéma "", as a matter of fact it is its opposite.",1
"It is touching, sad and joyous.",1
I wasn't disappointed.,1
"Allvaro Mancori's crisp widescreen cinematography gives the movie an impressively expansive sense of scope. Ugo Filippini's robust, rousing score has a nifty majestic sweep to it. Hercules'son gets severely wounded during a lion hunt that goes awry. Of course, we also get big mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption as well. ). The strenuous rough'n'tumble mano - a - mano major physical confrontation between Hercules and Antaius likewise totally rocks. Better still, the bizarre spirit world just reeks of spooky atmosphere ( gotta love that persistent thick swirling fog!",1
"It's often hard to hold on through this to watch the exciting finale. < br / > < br / > In a narrower focus, I might also add that further editing has improved individual scenes borrowed from the other films. This also sets up a fine final wrasslin'match between the real Hercules and his impersonator. Hercules the Avenger is by far the best single entry in the muscleman genre I can recall. ( It should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant but pointedly critical remark on the rise of Fascism in Italy. )",1
"This one strays from the path but certainly worth watching! It is a movie that explores the underworld of the weird, wretched and devastated individuals. She has met a man that has told her of an Astrologist who will show her the stars. The style is artsy and chock full of symbolism.",1
"It is also very poignant as an expression of a film style that was about to die. I'm still rather in shock over how good she was. You cannot take my word for it, you must see.",1
I love the Thackeray novel on which this film is based. < br / > < br / > Loy is front and center throughout. Loy's Becky is very much a pre - Code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways. Bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by Loy in a film that should be seen. Mary Forbes is icily good as Mrs. Sedley. That's what makes her fallen character so tragic.,1
"I've never read a good review for "" Vanity Fair "" and I can't understand why. For something that was "" rushed through in ten days "" it all comes off surprisingly well. And you know she deserves her comeuppance, and then some, but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it. Meow!",1
"WAY too esoteric for the standard American audience. NOW you have "" Viva Variety "". It was funny as Hell. Viva Variety did this for comedians. Too conceptual? And doomed.",1
"< br / > < br / > The "" hybrid "" was the mix of fact and fantasy. It's unlikely we'll ever see anything like this on television again.",1
"It certainly never bores which the recent PBS and MET versions did. Nearly all of the principal music is intact and beautifully sung. His seduction of Dorothy Dadridge's BESS "" There's a Boat dat's leavin'soon for New York, "" is one of many highlights. This had been the fashion at the time, so to blame the film for an 16 year tradition.",1
I loved the entire film. But she was wonderful as Dame Evie. I can't wait to see more of Rupert's films in the future.,1
"If anyone finds this on a home movie format please let me know. Anyway, in my opinion this version was best! Needless to say, they're not familiar with the other great actors in the film.",1
"I saw this once probably like most people my age ( 55 ) back in the 60's. I understand the dissatisfaction with the final product by both families. But this is a great movie, it was a great Opera ; but as a film it is wonderful.",1
I love the haunting melodies of this opera by Gershwin. I have been searching and searching to try to find the soundtrack on CD. A person's speaking voice and singing voice may be quite different.,1
"Now I know why it has never been available. Recently my daughter purchased a CD from Austria, I think.",1
"I have searched for this movie for years. < br / > < br / > Porgy & Bess contained first - rate, all - star cast.",1
It is my all time favorite. Before registering guidelines are not posted.,1
"It was also ironically, the Gershwin's greatest shame. For we can no longer see them at their best. < br / > < br / > Finally, it is a loss to the wonderful black actors who appeared in it.",1
"< br / > < br / > Surround sound was used with splendid effects throughout the movie. You could do that then. I never saw the movie again. The old Paramount Theatre ( I don't know if it still exists. ) < br / > < br / > I stayed in the theater for several showings. At 15 years of age, I was blown away. The third scene was near end of the movie as Porgy is leaving Catfish Row for New York to look for Bess.",1
"It is this trip that solidifies their bond. Ben and Evie's relationship survives test of time. He knows that it will provoke his mother's fury. < br / > < br / > When Ben gets back, everything crumbles at home. In fact the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera which was popular but she'd rather forget about it. He has been taking driving lessons. Ben gets to meet and taste the pleasures of the flesh with a sympathetic Bryony. In fact the family has taken a widower, to board with them.",1
Pearl Bailey made me laugh. And I fell in love with it. He loved it. I fell in Love with Sidney Poitier.,1
Don't wait until the film is beyond repair.,1
we had just been set up with Stereo Sound! !,1
"And in end, that is what comes through loud and clear. They did lack... something though. < br / > < br / > Now for the film. They just feel... far away. I love the singing voices. He is the ultimate meany. Not at all. They are perfect for this film. It is far from a ruined movie. It's pretty good. Marvelously staged by Premminger.",1
When is ART going to overcome racism? AN OPERA!!,1
"Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their portrayals. I was in my early 20's, just graduating from college when this movie appeared. A mainstream, high - budget extravaganze with an almost entirely black cast was a distinct novelty in 1959. Almost every black entertainer that we white people had any knowledge of was in the movie.",1
"This is why those individuals still living today as well those who are deceased are super star icons. I not have any negative views. Many who are no longer with us. < br / > < br / > I viewed this movie recently. Please to whom it my concern, please make this movie available so all can have this historical experience. The sound was excellent!",1
It took my breath away then at young age. The cast was one of the best i have seen in my life.,1
"Porgy & Bess "" was the very first movie my parents ever took me to see. What is the hold up?",1
"The loss of so much compromises Gershwin's brilliance - - no wonder the family doesn't like it. Stereotyping and racism are present, but not to a wince - inducing degree. I had the privilege recently of viewing what is said to be the last 35mm, Technicolor, stereo print and found it much livelier and more touching than remembered. George knew what he was doing, folks ; you didn't have to mess with it so much. But there are debits, beginning with all that variation from the stage text. Despite all the tinkering, it survives, and you'd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it.",1
"i just love the movie. his expressions are great, spectacular. it does not matter. lovely. and a wonderful accent.",1
I will continue to look for it though. This rendition of Porgy and Bess is a treasure.,1
Perhaps this can be fixed in a restoration. The performances are strong and memorable.,1
Please make the film available to public. I saw this movie when I was a kid and have been looking for it ever since.,1
Shame on these families for their pettiness.,1
"Brock Peters as Crown is aggressively masculine. Dorothy Dandridge as Bess is spectacularly beautiful. The costumes are also outstanding. It's just wonderful. < br / > < br / > The music is sublime 50! ) ( Actually, only Pearl and Sammy do their own vocalizing. ) The folks who saw this in its original release wouldn't have seen a much better copy. < br / > < br / > Sidney and Dorothy'singing voices are dubbed in, but they are dubbed in extremely well.",1
"It was my introduction to opera, and aided with my understanding of Tolerance.. Please family of Gerswhins or Premingers, release this classic soon!",1
There is a remarkable performance by Sammy Davis Jr. as Sportin Life. The voices are outstanding.,1
Typical of later Griffith films technically.,1
"He's a joy to behold. < br / > < br / > Finally, there's Carol Dempster. Much has been said against this actress, but her performance here is also richly comic.",1
"And meanwhile Sally is busy being pursued by handsome and rich young man, son of the man who helped grandpa get his riches. I love the few peeks at the old - fashioned circus and carnival that is shown here. Sally is feisty and loyal to McGargle no matter what he gets up to - but McGargle seems to feel a bit of guilt over keeping her in the circus instead of with her own family all these years. But grandfather the judge takes an immediate disliking to Sally'cause he doesn't like a "" show girl "" - what a stern, narrow - minded man he is, a real piece of work that guy! Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is delightful here - quite cute and comical in her performance.",1
"She hires Ben and the fireworks begin. DRIVING LESSONS is a little film that sneaks up on you. Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for the challenged coming of age Ben. Ben follows an ad and meets Dame Eve Walton ( Julie Walters ), an elderly has - been actress who is as zany as any character ever created. The chemistry between the two is as tender as that in the classic film'Harold and Maude '. Writer Jeremy Brock ('Mrs. Laura Linney is as always a superb actress playing a role quite different from her usual repertoire.",1
"This is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea, written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of "" John Goldfarb "" fame ; and it is a delightful narrative. She gets jealous of a rival for Larrabee's affections, then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business. Lili's target is William Larrabee, a charismatic U. S. squadron leader who can supply her valuable information. Larrabee'squadron, including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film ; and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic, both in its scope and realization.",1
This story takes place in Wisconsin. Watching further confirmed it.,1
For Penny and Gillian fans it's worth your time.,1
"I've watched in awhile. One of the most macabre, depressing, yet eye - opening docs.",1
i've been wondering where Michelle is now. ? i watched in hopes the it was never that bad for my mom! where are they know 2008?,1
"Like watching one guy frantically searching for fix he lost. The footage is amazingly candid. This is as real as it gets. ( or, at least, they don't seem to care ).",1
"You'll be pulled into their stories and will wish the film went on for twice as long. And can Sebastian become any more pathetic? Will Michelle go back to Bellevue for more detox? As a result, the film seems incomplete, but that may have been point. ).",1
It is my favorite.,1
The Femme Fatale? Trinity.,1
"< br / > < br / > Ben seeks an ad in a church newspaper for which the job requires to take care of an elderly lady. No matter, every actor has a time to shine and Rupert's light hits him for once in this movie.",1
"The agents hire a privat detective to track down Trinity. It is interesting, even if it feels a little out of place. < br / > < br / > But what about the story? The snowing scenes, the grainyiness, it all stuns the eye.",1
"animated aptly by Studio 4°C and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, it is an enjoyable variant on the usual matrix story. he forgets his hat but his faithful cat throws it to him in a moment of ludicrousness so absurd it's hilarious. who engage in challenging conflicts readily and often. it features a private detective who is hired for big money to look for a hacker named Trinity.",1
"The plot is fitting, and the story - telling, as well, as the music, is spot - on. This is immensely faithful to the trilogy in that aspect, the tone. 8 / 10 The ending could not have been more appropriate for this. The pacing is perfect. The style, which is omnipresent in this, is Noir.",1
Watanabe'Tarantino - style slickness comes through here full throttle.,1
< br / > < br / > The ending was a little bit bland but still okay. For those out there who like old fashion stories this is one for you.,1
< br / > < br / > The film is beautifully sensitive and not at all judgmental or patronizing to any group portrayed. This is the main point explored in Chicken Tikka Masala - presumably named after the Western spicy dish involving tender pieces of young chicken flesh! Just how exactly do gay Asians manage in a culture that generally refuses to even recognize the concept of homosexuality?,1
"','hey! ','i work there! ).",1
"Most movies won't be. Sorry guy, just my 2 cents. And I liked the music ( + # 4 ).",1
"The suddenness of the realization, the magnitude of it, sometimes throws us into disarray. < br / > < br / > So that's what this movie was about. I am so happy that I did! In fact, so too did Mr. Fincham, didn't he?! I've felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him.",1
The plot is outstanding as well. The problem is that he is gay. Thanks for making this film! This film makes viewers think hard.,1
And getting too personal? ! It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.,1
"Life on the run turns Jose into a bandit. They then have to leave town. In the end, Jose loses his mind and ends up killing Carmen. ( Watch her in "" Spanglish "" ).",1
"I think the movie is quite good, anyway. Why so many people keep thinking Don José is French?",1
"There have been approximately 60 different films & Television plays, besides the classic Opera of this tale of a sex mad girl and her hapless soldier lover. This story has been done so many times, in various ways. < br / > < br / > In fact this is almost an NC - 17 film.",1
I mean this movie is very good in all the technical aspects.,1
"Even for the non - opera loving public the name CARMEN is immediately recognized as an opera by Bizet about a gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men. ). Carmen keeps her pact, providing José with his first sexual encounter, and José is doomed.",1
"Vega definitely sizzles, as to be expected. This is another fine example of triumph of daring European cinema over glitzy and safe Hollywood fare.",1
"Someone complains about the typical Spanish clichés in the movie. It is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not having understood his or her lines. And Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with her Andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible. < br / > < br / > And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Let's take it as it is. If all the rest of the audience did, the problem most likely lies somewhere else.",1
I recommend it to everyone : the best spanish movie of the year. Excellent movie in many aspects.,1
"A child of two worlds, god and theater. Every day. A beautiful film. And a good bit of wine and irony!",1
Oh oh oh!,1
"Cassavetes is always a joy to watch, and even more so with Gena Rowlands sharing the spotlight. An extremely gentle retelling of the Shakespeare play ( and much more overt about it than Forbidden Planet ).",1
And each character does so. It is long. No climax. It wouldn't work if filmed anywhere else.,1
"Surandon nailed hers, as Raul Julia did also. I really click with the film. Talk about boredom. )",1
This is simply a fantastic movie!,1
A good drama mixed with comedy and tension and near insanity. This recent DVD release is worth renting. Raul Julia and Gena Rowlands round out a strong cast.,1
"That it is. "" Beauty, magic, inspiration, and serenity. "" It's not Prospero, but something rich and strange that makes for a terrific sea change all his own. < br / > < br / > It's not a perfect movie, by any means.",1
"Cast, locations, script, music are just fantastic. Cassavetes and Rowland were never better. As an experiment, however, it succeeds just spectacularly.",1
The acting is superb.,1
"He's got the power, the strengh but he is human. and i've seen a lot of movies.",1
"Very well acted, especially by Julie Walters.",1
"A work of art should never be criticised for what it isn't, but for what it is. What "" Tempest "" is, then, is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. Don't miss it. One of best movies of the 80's.",1
"Show me the magic "".",1
"And funny. This is a retake on the Shakespeare "" comedy "", but utterly removed from the stage. It wasn't big box office hit, but whenever it does come to DVD, it will sell.",1
"This film is sad and tragic and funny and intense. Julia stops the show in one scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by Liza Minnelli singing "" New York, New York "".",1
"Tempest "" is a somewhat self - indulgent, uneven, discursive movie. And in fact, I probably have watched it several dozen times. Most times, I see something I missed before.",1
"See it! All comes together at the end in a classic closing scene where all is reconciled. Raul Julia, the goatherd, is seen dancing with his goat. I've rented this gem several times!",1
He was such a gentleman. ! Or at least it has to mine. I love his role in this movie. Watch it and enjoy!,1
See It. I thought this movie was fun.,1
I thought this movie was quite good.,1
"Loved this movie, what a hoot.",1
"I recommend you do the same. Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is based on somewhat pat formula by now of Japanese school drama anime. There's a very beautiful and sexy girl in a supporting role. < br / > < br / > 4. Unusual things happens in an usual social settings. The visuals are first rate, and done beautifully. It's much more entertaining to watch the series this way. They just have it.",1
"< br / > < br / > Conclusion : Unquestionably, one of best series of 2006. I have no words to really describe this series.",1
Haruhi is truly one of those shows.,1
A far - cry from usual 2D male leading characters that tends to populate the medium. However defying his gut instincts he begins talking to her. In doing so it soon becomes apparent she isn't some ordinary high schooler.,1
"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an anime that left quite the impression on me. It's a bit of a conundrum, but an enjoyable one all the same.",1
"I first heard about The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya from a reviewer on Youtube. < br / > < br / > Haruhi "" recruits "" three extra members. The third is Itsuki Koizumi, a friendly and sociable transfer student who is always smiling. Upon "" advice "" from Kyon, Haruhi decides to form her own club with Kyon's club. Plus the opening and ending themes are great.",1
"From the get go, you won't be able to look away, and you won't want to. "" He's the narrator, and his quick wit always makes the scene that much more entertaining. < br / > < br / > After all the focus is on the characters. The title character, Haruhi Suzumiya, is by far one of the most eccentric heroines of any anime ever.",1
So go and watch it. The Animation is really good and above TV average. You won't regret entering Suzumiya Haruhi'world.,1
The anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the stories it shows.,1
It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles.,1
"The setting just happen to be a school environment. < br / > < br / > What about the story then? Except for Haruhi, the other members of the SOS - brigade is Kyon. He is the real protagonist of the show. Well, it's not!",1
"I can't really say what it's about, really. Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a very high - rated anime in almost every review page you'll find on the web. Trust me, I don't go around giving 10 to every thing that I watch. A very well drawn, perfectly animated world, that is. So I really wanted to know why, and I was anything but disappointed.",1
"< br / > < br / > Based on that strong foundation, the series further succeeds with a truly phenomenal level of attention to detail. Okay, let me start off by saying that, on the whole, I don't like anime very much. As previously stated, the episodes air out of chronological order. < br / > < br / > It was at that point that the strengths of this series started to manifest themselves. < br / > < br / > So, when I started watching this series at the behest of a friend, I was primed for disappointment after the first couple of episodes. At about the third episode, my opinion drastically changed. It'a break from formula, and it works incredibly well.",1
A Must See! Old story fresh view. < br / > < br / > Excellent positive African - American Love Story.,1
One of my favorite CD '.,1
But it is my personal best. I try to be diverse in my movie watching. Of course no one will ever remember it.,1
Old story fresh view.,1
"Even though I didn't always agree with Gene Siskel, I agree with him here. He was giving it a compliment even though now that might have been taken as an insult these days. Exactly. These two actually have chemistry together. Not one obscene stereotype can be found here. Contrast that with the Romance movies of toady.",1
Love Jones is one of the best movies I've experienced. Being our Natural selves. I am in love with the direction. < br / > < br / > This movie deserves to be seen.,1
"The values in the piece are continued and brought out thoroughly up until the final drag, in a very consistent way. Charismatic and beautiful acting together with a tight and fact paced script make this a must - see this Christmas. Her role in "" Driving Lessons "" is enjoyable and memorable in every sense.",1
"Great film, enjoy!",1
"This is virtually an untapped market. If you hadn't guessed, I loved it! The dialogue was realistically written, and delivered with honesty. Love Jones was visually captivating as well.",1
Should she have gone away? Who knows...? The jazz that permeates the film and the cinematography will seduce you. < br / > < br / > See this one with someone you love ( wink ).,1
I love this film a must see! !,1
Where is Tate anyway?,1
?,1
It's a shame this movie didn't get more play in theatres.,1
I wasn't expecting much out of this movie and I was slapped in the face. It is a MUST see!,1
Finally a movie that shows positive aspects of the black community.,1
Was it the mood of the film? I want moreeeeee..........,1
All other was also good in this movie. Salman khan and Aamir khan rocked.,1
< br / > < br / > This movie is a masterpiece. Period.,1
Aamir Khan is known as'MR. Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time. They want to become rich without bearing any pain.,1
"! Shakti Kapoor was good, but Jagdeep over acted as usual! < br / > < br / > MUSIC 9 / 10. < br / > < br / > STAR. It is the best movie released in Bollywood upto date.",1
"I love this film. Rabbit "". Relax.",1
Rupert Grint shows he can act past Harry Potter.,1
"Raveena has done fine, but Karshima really turns irritating in some sequences. This film is really funny. of times without getting bored.",1
But Andaaz Apna Apna is pretty different from the movies i have said above. SO all i can say is Hind comedy is finally evolving.,1
All the characters are memorable. Let your brain relax for some time. Don't try to look for logic in this movie.,1
The jokes are refreshing and not cheap.. !,1
A very funny movie from start to finish.,1
! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have given justice to their roles.,1
"If you love comedies, this is a must - see. And Aami Khan is outstanding.",1
The movie Andaz Apna Apna in my books is the top 5 intelligent comedy movies ever made in Bollywood perhaps even Hollywood.,1
"Rupert Grint breaks away from "" Ron Weasley "" and tries on someone new. The complexity of her character couldn't have been more flawlessly portrayed by anyone else.",1
It's wonderful. < br / > < br / > I loved the film.,1
< br / > < br / > Watch it you'll love it!!!! ! This is my favourite Indian movie of all time. It is comic genius. Salman Khan is hilarious.,1
"Teja ( Teja Main Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai! ) Gogo, makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36, 000 rupees to Teja ( who is as Balla had once said, "" A Fraud and Cheat! "" This movie is simply marvelous and according to me, is the funniest movie I've ever seen! < br / > < br / > Rank # 2. : Teja is an evil character who is Ram Gopal Bajaj's twin. And yes, I do put it over Hera Pheri... reason? ).",1
"! < br / > < br / > Good Music. See it all in super comedy ANDAZ APNA APNA. < br / > < br / > Aamir, Salman, Raveena, Karishma and Paresh at there best. As the story progresses it turns out to be a mad chase from Ram Gopal Bajaj's wealth, full of humor, romance thrills and chills. So Teja plants Bhalla. Will Raveena & Karishma see through Amar and Prem's mischievous intentions? Ijust liked it.",1
The complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot.,1
Songs are rightly placed and are funny. Story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways. Enti cast is perfectly cast right from Deven Verma till Viju Khote.,1
It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.,1
"Salman Khan was also good as the somewhat dimmer of the two characters. He is amazingly good at comedy, I never knew. From here on they try to oust each other. Raveena and karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing. Watch it! The real pick of the lot is Paresh Rawal as usual. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon.",1
"< br / > < br / > The heart of the movie is what happens when Ben and Evie's worlds collide. In my book this film succeeds on pure charm, no small feat in itself. Julie Walters'Dame Evie is a gloriously over the top and over the hill actress.",1
This is one of the few films with Aamir and Salman together ( probably the only film! The plot thickens when Paresh Rawal & Co. plan to take over all the wealth. There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindi Cinema. ). The movie is well paced and very funny. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a dim - wit. Andaz Apna Apna happens to be one of them. Aamir and Salman Khan try their best to outwit each other and woo Raveena.,1
They want to get rich quick and so move to the big city. This movie fully deserves to be one of the top Hindi comedies ever made. Leave the company of your brains and just ENJOY.,1
This has a great balance of action and story and Alex Cord is great in it. He really should have been bigger star.,1
"I found this to be an underrated, quietly compelling Spaghetti Western ( also known as DEAD OR ALIVE ).",1
"Somewhat gruesome, but realistic. I would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.",1
"< br / > < br / > All of this is not to say that anyone should avoid this film. Mario Brega and Arthur Kennedy are also great here. It is filmed beautifully, with a relatively high production value for a film in this genre. The soundtrack kind of reminds me of the music from "" The Unforgiven. "" I did enjoy watching it very much.",1
"Nearly everyone who helps him is killed. The cast alone tells you this will be a notch above the usual Italian western. To emphasize his passivity, Clay McCord - - don't you love that name? Especially interesting here is the character played by Alex Cord.",1
"I agree that ending is less than satisfying. "". As they ride away one is heard to comment, "" If this amnesty keeps up I'm gonna start hunting buffalo!",1
Even if you can advise of the studio contact so that we might go direct. Your help would be appreciated.,1
"I loved this movie, it was cute and funny! ! I hope I can buy this one!",1
"Reluctantly, Grace agrees. But, there are complications. First, there is the nice cast.",1
I did love it when that one fell apart though. I bet it still tasted good.,1
The whole family can view this film. Very romantic. The supporting cast was good as well.,1
"To bad that no soundtrack is available. The desserts look great. Anyway, cast is great.",1
"But hey, check out "" Just Desserts. "" ( PS. And this movie fit that exact billing. YUMMO! It's on Hallmark Channel. I always thought he was something straight out of a Hepburn - Grant comedy.",1
And I am very pro gay.,1
"Here, it was networked in prime - time. The shadow the show cast was huge. 'Someone else obviously noticed the difference.",1
It was a great show and deserves DVD release.,1
"So i hope one day the guys at Carlton TV decide to release it on DVD, cheers, Nick.",1
And maybe that's good. < br / > < br / > Snakes on a Train however knew exactly what it was. < br / > < br / > For this it gets 7 out of 10. This was a cheaply made horror movie on a train.,1
"The scenery was also striking, especially the countryside. He's definitely one to look out for in the future.",1
This is one of the funniest movies ever made. It'll great to see this guy get his due.,1
"An absolute gut - buster of a kitsch howler. Naturally, a bunch of deadly vipers get lose so they can terrorize the motley assortment of passengers. ).",1
Know what to expect and you wont regret it! Lots of them. < br / > < br / > The move is basically about snakes.. on a train. You really need to be a fan to get the gag.,1
They are garbage. It may become a cult classic among many fans.,1
How many movies have a snake gobble a train? Not only kids in jeopardy but kid eaten!,1
"There can be no better time spent then coming together to enjoy a good bad movie. < br / > < br / > The gore itself is really good, and the characters have awesome roles. < br / > < br / > A solid 7 out of 10.",1
< br / > < br / > Any fool can nitpick anything.,1
I found the episodes to be fascinating and well written.,1
"For example, one of the episodes I saw was about cloning, and a man who was trying to clone humans. Highly recommendable. In addition, it made you think about ethics and how good or bad could this be. This series is just so impressive and interesting...",1
First of all I'd like to start by saying it's a refreshing start to see a British Drama that finally looks and feels believable.,1
They all become horny and then bitchy at the same time.,1
"The school is small one, with only two teachers and a handful of girls. Even while serving with his unit, McBurney played no active part in the conflict ; he is a Quaker, whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms, and was serving with the Union forces as a medical orderly. Even twelve year old Amy appears to have a sort of childish crush on him. < br / > < br / > The film is set in Louisiana towards the end of the war and starts with the injured McBurney being discovered by a young girl named Amy and brought back to her boarding school. "" The Beguiled "" is a strange work among Clint Eastwood's oeuvre.",1
"It's thoroughly engrossing and entertaining but not really realistic. Mr. Eastwood has said this is one of his own two favorite films. ( I know, having grown up in the South and attended a girls'school and college.",1
Edwina shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch. < br / > < br / > Finally there is Jo Ann Harris who is stunningly perfect as flirty Carol. Hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene.,1
"Excellent film - 9 / 10. It is a wonderfully shot film and I love most films involving the Civil War. I couldn't agree more. Watch out! They wanted to stick to the book, for one.",1
"Particularly here are the four main female characters, each of varying ages and each with varying attractions to their'Yankee'man. It is also a story where Eastwood is not surrounded in a world full of dangerous men but women who, despite their first appearances, have darker sides to them. It's almost a 180 from what'Harry'had for audiences. And there's even romance in it in between some of the rougher and more complex scenes.",1
"For Clint Eastwood's die - hard fans, it will be a disappointment.",1
"Mae Mercer is strongly tailored as the black maid and Jo Ann Harris is the pick of the crop from the young pupils with her seductively sly persona. A profoundly eminent Geraldine Page steals the picture as the hardened head mistress and the elegant Elizabeth Hartman adds a delicate sincereness to her innocent character. Clint Eastwood as the smoothly suave, sweet talking chameleon union soldier is very impressionable and delightfully assured. < br / > < br / > While the performances, are truly commendable and high of quality. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but it all comes at a price in the end.",1
"Villain or Victim? For a film that virtually takes place in a single location it never loses visual interest. Whatever you think, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1
It is a great film. Please go see it!,1
"This film has some rather shocking scenes and subject matter considering it was made in 1971. < br / > < br / > Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Page, and Elizabeth Hartman do excellent work in the film, as do all the cast members.",1
I was quite mistaken.,1
The child takes him to the girls boarding school where she lives. This film was a surprise.,1
"And who is "" beguiled "" here exactly? This movie is not what it appears to be.",1
8 out of 10. Not typical Eastwood at all.,1
"Page was trained as a theater actress, and it shows in all of her performances. Not a great film, but a morbidly entertaining one. Each of the other girls responds to him in her own particular way as well.",1
Some of the sexual - laced scenes disturbing. Eastwood is not a nice man. Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this film. Eastwood plays Cpl.,1
"McBee sets about seducing them, emotionally if not physically, this leads to considerable jealousy amongst the girls. The former group prevail and he gradually recovers.",1
"Be it hero, anti - hero or avenging hero. In this film he is pure villain and he plays it well. In the end you are never so happy to see Clint die a terrible death.",1
"< br / > < br / > Eastwood gives a typically great performance. McBurney is an amoral, conniving, and lustful charlatan. Most of them are sexually attracted to him.",1
"Mature, ambiguous and starkly shot, it's a shame it isn't more widely known. And boy is the revenge brutal. Shut away from the world, the women project their romantic fantasies on to him, and he responds with callous, male manipulation. < br / > < br / > 8. < br / > < br / > Don Siegel left quite a legacy of fine films behind.",1
Edwina shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch. < br / > < br / > Finally there is Jo Ann Harris who is stunningly perfect as flirty Carol. Hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene.,1
Never has a film been so deliciously erotic yet disturbingly macabre at the same time.,1
"I first saw this movie in one of my college film classes in the mid - 1970's, and was immediately taken with it. The Beguiled "" is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films, and a departure from his typical early roles. Directed by Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood collaborated on several films, it was made a year before Eastwood's directorial debut with "" Play Misty For Me "".",1
"His theme of a little man against the world, who triumphs through bravery & ingenuity, dominates his films. A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short. Through every calamity & disaster, Buster remained the Great Stone Face, atoic survivor in a universe gone mad. < br / > < br / > Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT ( "" scapegoat "" ) for a dangerous escaped murderer. Big Joe Roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief. < br / > < br / > This is a wonderful, hilarious little film with Keaton at his absolute best. In what is essentially a series of chases, Buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination. Now, well past his centenary, Buster Keaton is routinely recognized & appreciated as one of cinema's true authentic geniuses.",1
The perspective of the clerks dispels that view.,1
"< br / > < br / > Anyone reading this have any leads? This definitely ranks among my favorites, and I hope to see it again!",1
"He's a frightening dude, but has a great imagination and is very funny. A definite 9 out of 10. Check it out!",1
"Basically the movie gives you an inner look into the mind of the lead character "" Joe "".",1
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.,1
His movies explain themselves through the wonderful ( yet incredibly dangerous ) things he did to himself. The dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mix - up with a wanted felon.,1
"I really liked the Movie "" JOE. "" He is my Stepsons Father - In - Law. in Southampton, Long Island.",1
"God help us. So, the spirit of Joe in the film is resurrected in the campaign of Joe The Plumber!",1
Well worth seeing.,1
"Nobody wants to fight Joe, but Joe feels he must defend himself.",1
Certainly the ending packs a wallop even today after all these years! What can I say?,1
< br / > < br / > This film needs to be remembered.,1
"With minor intricacies like those, director John Avildsen captures many of the subtle but ever present hints of how life was four decades ago. Joe "" took a major leap in that regard, particularly since it was a'mainstream'picture. ), and how the counter culture jarred the sensibilities of most of the country.",1
"The comparison even carries over into Joe's wife and personal life and pastimes. Joe is a funny film that on the surface at least, is anti violence and anti racist. Unusual film about a man who befriends his social opposite out of fear of blackmail.",1
"Joe and wife Mary Jo are clearly the archetypes for Archie Bunker and Dingbat wife, Edith. WARNING : Reading this entry after watching the movie!",1
This is a wonderful comedy short - - one of Keaton's absolute best.,1
"This was pretty good snapshot - not exact, a bit caricaturist - but actually pretty close to how it was back then. 15 an hour is too much to pay their people. And those kids shouldn't have ripped Joe and Compton off. < br / > < br / > Nothing's really changed.",1
"By just wanting him and his wife to "" get to know "" him and his wife. Yes, Susan does look great here and for a young actress a very good early role. Joe almost buys it but then takes it as funny. I think Boyle even went back to "" Joe "" a little to play Frank.",1
"). He reminds me of a little kid trapped in big, dumb, awkward body. Bill turns to Joe for help.",1
"If Archie Bunker was armed, he may well have been "" Joe "". 8 out of 10.",1
"I actually sympathized with some of his complaints. Joe is her film debut. Susan Sarandon fans will be delighted. Recommended, 8 / 10.",1
"But in the end, everything has dead serious consequences. I can't come up with an analogy. One day, Bill accidentally kills Melissa's boyfriend.",1
"One could only be thankful that he was killed off early in the film. In spite of its strengths this film does have its weaknesses. Joe "" is a classic film of an unlikely friendship. And this is only the beginning. """,1
"The first time was 30 + years ago on an Air Force Base. Foremost was the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive. They look alike and sound alike. As someone else commented, you could not take you eyes off her. And of course the shocking ending made a lasting impression. Caution - possible spoilers ahead.. Just watched'Joe'for the second time. What a loss that she did not do more movies when she looked like that. Sgt.",1
"If you don't, you probably wont. !",1
"The elevator scene is class, especially when he does the going - down thing in the phone booth, and then fiddles with the floor - indicator. Saw this for the first time on UK TV, with good musical accompaniment. The jump through the transom is really impressive, and there's so much more.",1
This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. Robert McKimson's'Acrobatty Bunny'is one of the director's finest shorts.,1
9 / 10. Vanaja is a film of superlatives. The casting was absolutely dead - on.,1
The film is strikingly beautiful with rich color. A lower caste girl wants to sing and dance.,1
Great film.,1
"The young woman is attractive, intelligent, and ambitious. < br / > < br / > This is a movie that is not to be missed. This isn't what "" Vanaja "" shows us. Just be sure to see it. ( Don't think Bollywood - - this is classical dance.",1
"On the way their car breaks down and they meet Peggy Williams, a schoolteacher on holidays and she offers to help them out.",1
So if you do find a copy of it I suggest watching it! It'wonderful and heartwarming. The movie has the best running theme of all - family togetherness.,1
It inspired me then and it amazes me now.,1
My cousins and I have watched this movie ever since we were little. It is an old movie but don't let that fool you.,1
"tough life gets tougher when the three children of a single mom are scheduled to be sent to separate foster homes after her untimely passing. < br / > < br / > With all its weaknesses, I still give this movie a strong recommendation.",1
I miss it.,1
"But he actually had more conflict from police forces in his shorts. In CONVICT 13 he is dragged back to prison when mistaken for an escaped convict. < br / > < br / > Keaton is a tramp just looking for food. The cop gives chase, and Keaton ( as luck would have it ) runs into another cop, tries to act normal, but Look at STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., where he tries to spring his dad from a calaboose. But he is totally unlucky. Think of Laurel and Hardy as ill - fated cops in MIDNIGHT PATROL.",1
Please comment if you had a similar reaction to b & w version. These are the ones I remember best as a four year old. You had to have been there! I didn't realize the 56 broadcast was not the same as the 55.,1
instead of Ed McBain'New York City. Had this been treated in a more sensational manner then it would have been a more acceptable but lesser film.,1
The young faces Lisa Langlois and Aude Landry do an incredibly good job as well.,1
"Highly recommended viewing. The film is a murder mystery and begins when a young girl covered in blood is brought into a police station. The unknown Aude Landry also gives a great performance in her role as Patricia. I honestly can't believe that this film isn't more highly rated. The film is a French and Canadian co - production, and takes place in Canada.",1
"9 out of 10. Blood Relative "" is an overlooked masterpiece. The conclusion is pretty disturbing.",1
The film ends with a warning : those who came to Russia with the sword will die by the sword.,1
It has however aged very badly.,1
"Indeed, this film really looks more like a silent film with some sound added. This was Eisenstein's first sound film, and it's clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium. """,1
"Eisenstein's films are especially designed * not * to be realistic. Eisenstein was one of the early proponents of film as an art form, not just as entertainment. < br / > < br / > The acting isn't wooden, it'meant to be slightly mannered.",1
The first 10 min how he handled the passing by Mongol was captivating.,1
"How we fought, how we routed them! This film with its accompanying score have a special place in the world and that may be just as true on the internet as anywhere. no foe shall ravage Russian fields. Rise to arms, arise, native mother Russia! This is a song about Alexander Nevsky.",1
But it is good to cringe every now and then. In many ways this is a truly superb film. This film was made in 1938 in the USSR. The images and the music complement each other marvelously.,1
"( Warning : spoilers! Some of the actors are also quite magnificent. It's very old and it's, er, clumsy. Wonder why? After he's captured he looks * so * pathetic.",1
< br / > < br / > By US standards the acting is a bittilted. Direction is incredible.,1
"< br / > < br / > The story itself is fairly standard Soviet wartime anti - German propaganda. The cantata can be appreciated for itself, but having seen the movie helps.",1
Probably Sergei Eisenstein's greatest work. 10 out of 10. Also see'Battleship Potemkin '.,1
Sometimes Eisenstein is better in clips. Russian Propaganda at its finest.,1
It was excell!,1
Even women put on a chain armor... She promises to marry the most valiant. Pskov is burned to the ground. Their objective is Novgorod. The marauding occupation forces distribute the looty.,1
"The music was beautiful. It was not made to please modern audiences, so some people nowadays may think it is creaky or stilted. I found it to be absorbing throughout. I was watching this on an old videotape from the library, though. This film is one of the classics of cinema history.",1
This leads to a number of chases and escapes as the authorities get ever closer to the increasingly desperate Keaton. This is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies. Anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to watch this because they will not be disappointed. Brilliant!,1
I never get tired of watch REAL CLASSICS like this film.,1
"On those terms Alexander Nevsky is fearless. It is something that has a full - blown message to it, and a point of view. If I were a member of an awards group at the time of this film's release I probably would award Eisenstein with the director's award of the year, posthumously. In this particular case, the Russians against the Germans. Lord of the Rings fans, meet the films'grandfather, so to speak.",1
"OK, you want the snaffle & bit. I confess. I'll risk the nervy thorobred every time. Mozart had'too many notes '? But the images are burned in my brain. to recognize Croatia in the 1990s remember the chaos & genocides? As said, the music of Prokofiev is magnificent. Great art transcends all, as did'Nevsky ', as did'All Quiet on the Western front '. Too glib. I saw it last 40 odd years ago. Naturalism? Stylized acting?",1
"Not all of the elements work and the film is probably a bit too long, but it still resonates. This reflects the Stalinist philosophy that had risen to the fore by 1938. Nevsky is just one of many men.",1
"But wartime German propaganda films could also be subtle. < br / > < Both films are stagey, but in different ways. This works very well for Cerkassov's speeches as Alexander, because part of his job as a prince and military leader was to play a role in public. Karl Ritter's Urlaub auf Ehrenwort ( Furlough on Word of Honor ) is typical.",1
"I'm not sure how many times I've seen it, perhaps 10, perhaps 20. There are a couple of closeups of the dead men. His hands are holding a flickering candle. The one that struck me most was a shot of the blond youth.",1
"I'm listening to "" Nevsky "" on the radio right now and it still tears me up.",1
The story takes place in 1242.,1
"Also, the battle goes on forever ( half an hour? ) - - painfully long.",1
"Not all, but most of this story is Buster being mistaken for "" Dead Shot Dan, "" a notorious criminal. That was Keaton at his best. Cool! It's Buster at his slapstick best, or near it, and so it serves its purpose : to entertain us. < br / > < br / > It's just a madcap half hour that makes little sense, but cares?",1
You can watch every image of the film and see the beauty in it. A stunning piece of art.,1
It's untrue.,1
The presence of Prince Alexander on screen is truly amazing. A true tribute paid from one director to another. The comparisons are unmistakable.,1
"Let's say it as it is, it is indeed pure propaganda for patriotism but isn't "" Saving private Ryan "" or "" The longest day "" so? Aleksandr Nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography as almost every shot is a sublime picture. I didn't care that much then ( I was a kid! )",1
My vote is ten. The idea was to make propaganda pro - Russia.,1
I saw this film back in the early 70's and I was mesmerised by Judy Geeson. < br / > < br / > A real classic.,1
"< br / > < br / > PS I just saw it again and its just as good. That said, he's brilliant in this. One day TV too will be enlightened. PH just about pulls it off.",1
Peter Hall made few films and on this evidence that is a great shame.,1
"< br / > < br / > Well, apart from the obligatory death, I loved the film and so hated the way it ended. SPOILER ALERT - - AND I REALLY MEAN IT! Oh well, at least I can appreciate the film's message that you need to seize the moment. !",1
). We can say that the movie was quiet and endearing. I'm sure it would call out to bigger audience.,1
This is one to seek out and enjoy.,1
It is told with sympathy and without too much emotion.,1
"The location is a quaint Korean village. I watched this film with high expectations but was somewhat disappointed. In my mind he is a sweet, noble loser.",1
"Is it a great film? Thank you and goodbye "".",1
"You will get more from the movie. Just calm down. As he did in the film, he chose giving up. Everything.",1
"< br / > < br / > It'very obvious that I enjoy this movie a lot. This film would have put the typical Hollywood "" tearjerkers "" to shame. So, it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea.",1
"I dint even cry, but my eyes were red hot. This movie is so simple. The ending of the movie left me Speechless. 9.",1
i think that is why this film is so special.,1
You will cry. CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST is a perfect movie. A flawless movie about all the flaws of humanity. I simply cannot recommend this movie enough.,1
"Best gags - the bread line and t he "" elevator.",1
"It is the grace in which he conducts his life - his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. It is their ground of being, the place where they come from. Love is not something they say or do. < br / > < br / > The photographer, Jung - won, is played by Han Suk - kyu, at one time, Korea's most popular star. < br / > < br / > Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer.",1
"I did that night, though, and I thank God deeply for it. I guarantee it will affect you. I'm out of time, but I'm far from finished with my appraissa here, so Ill be back as soon as I can.",1
"Refreshingly unsentimental and honest, this is on par with Ozu's works. < br / > < br / > Scrat my title, this one is perfect!",1
"I suspect I will be calm, for I will have little choice in the matter. Romances, as previously stated, are hardly ever earthshaking affairs that leave you at the top of the world or batter and bruised. For if someone did, I would not believe him anyway, for no one but me would know. That you are willing to take a great degree of pain for them. Can I be so selfless? Again, the answer Almost never, if what I see as normal life around me is anything to judge by. No one can tell me when I am in love. How often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen, with torrid affairs and passionate encounters?",1
Hooray for Korean cinema! Life goes on.,1
"He just tried to do best while he was alive. I was very happy and at the same time quite surprised by other positive comments written by non - Koreans below. Rather, what haunts Jungwon ( a leading actor ) is his impending death. The attraction of this film might be hard to avoid to foreigners, too. He does not tell anybody around him about his death. Of course, this film depicts love between a man and a woman. However, the very theme is way beyond that.",1
"But as Peppard reminds his group on the way home, "" The trouble with being "" hero "" - - is the morning after "". Its storyline can be retailed in a single pair of sentences. Other stalwarts in the class include John Larch and John Russell. This is Paul Wendkos'masterpiece. To find out why he says so, you will have to see "" Cannon For Cordoba "".",1
"Rod Douglas, you know it's going to have action and lot's of it. Vallone and John Larch are not very menacing. 'Indeed, when you read the opening credits headlining the cast is none other than George Peppard as Capt. Since the United States Army cannot enter Mexico legally, Capt. Pete Duel and Don Gordon ( Who is superb. ) Not so with the men who side with Peppard. Dramatic action follows, as does lots of explosive excitement.",1
"Vernen Wells was good! com, Amazon. Well, this one is really hard - core! Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! His character is incredibly tuff! There is ton of action that has to be seen to be believed! There is so much that happens in the 95 minute run time.",1
"Still, they didn't call him the Great Stone Face for nothing : Buster never let the public see him sweat.",1
"OK, this movie has some cheesy moments, but which movie hasn't? There was also many impressive explosions and one great chase scene. The acting was decent, Charles Napier was incredible and his character was real tough.",1
"He was good here besides "" American Samurai "". His skill in martial art was performed above average. A tremendous action movie that I have ever seen. Anyone could help me? Very Recommended for action fans. He succeeded to make fighting scenes nice to watch.",1
"I think we'll be seeing more of these fine actors in the future. "" The good guys are good and the bad guys are really bad!. Hell To Pay "" features screen legends along with newer names in Hollywood.",1
"Both are young and promising, and I think we should see more of them in future western productions. Great work, Chris! I sincerely enjoyed this western movie - was worth every minute. Chris has an outstanding talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters, too.",1
"Hell to Pay is a bit bloody for my taste, even though it is no worse than many films. I think it may be best I've ever heard! They are awesome!!",1
! The plot was very suspenseful.,1
Hope to see more.,1
"It was distracting at times. Don't expect anything too "" deep "". It was a play on Doc Adams'name from Gunsmoke.",1
"Those guys are shooters, not actors. You get 100 minutes of good old entertainment.",1
"After all, it's just a cartoon. That would have been okay if they hadn't marketed this film for kids as well as adults. Grotesque "" I can handle, but who wants "" gross. "" Generall too much darkness and some cheap shots on Christian - bashing also made me re - consider my previously - high rating of this film. The stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the Batman movies. For a long time, this was my favorite of the Batman films. Sorry, but I prefer a kinder - gentler Batman movie. The three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating.",1
She just keeps getting better and better.,1
"Like its predecessor, "" Batman Returns "" enjoyed an enormous commercial success. It means that the director gave way to fight sequences which are better mastered than in the first Batman. I think of Michèle Pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as Catwoman. But given the bad reviews ( 3 out of 10 on IMDb! The director attempted to make of him, very well acted by De Vito an ambiguous character. But he didn't neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that.",1
"< br / > < br / > Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. < br / > < br / > Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. This film is where the Batman franchise ought to have stopped. There simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four - cornered fight. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.",1
"All the credit goes to Tom Burton and the cast, they've done an incredible job. Best watch it during the winter. < br / > < br / > Overall, its an amazing movie. Batman Returns however is by far the best film in the series. Michelle Pfiffer plays the sleek and very seducing'Catwoman'after cats had given her there genes from being bitten.",1
"But still, he was a dangerous villain in fact, and he needed to be stopped. Really, the actors did all a masterful work with Batman Returns, which made it a successful movie.",1
"Instead, Burton delivers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase,'out there '. < br / > < br / > Batman Returns is bleak.",1
"Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. what can i say, this film is amazing. They are detailed, eye catching, sinister, Gothic, unique, dark and so many other adjectives can describe how amazing they look. The sets are amazing.",1
The best Batman movie of the 90's no doubt about it.,1
"True, the 3rd act doesn't work. < br / > < br / > Keaton is underrated as Batman. Walken is Walken - - but even more nasty than usual. Devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to Penguin, but he is good and memorable.",1
"She actually got a good amount of back story as well. Simple, throw in Danny DeVito. However, the music is similar to the first if not darker. Two completely different personalities in one.",1
< br / > < br / > Cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that's taking place within it. First you have Danny DeVito who is delightfully insane as the Penguin. Batman Returns It is my opinion that the first Batman of the Batman series was only half the movie that Batman Returns is.,1
"I really like Traci Lords. She play the dowdy, conservative, reporter to a'T '.",1
"Burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far ;'Batman Returns '. Camp, but well - done. Even if they're going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore Bruce Wayne / Batman psyche further but in honesty I don't think there's all that much to tap in to. In what would fair up to being even more expansive, louder, dreary, and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for price of one. And his turn of Bruce Wayne was well served too. ).",1
"It is assured film - making from beginning to end. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, well, as always, Christopher Walken! < br / > < br / > BATMAN RETURNS, more so than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. < br / > < br / > Danny DeVito as The Penguin is disturbing, scary, hilarious, and lethal. ).",1
"A plan forms between both villains to destroy Gotham and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat. 1992's "" Batman Returns "" was Tim Burton's second round as director and yet again he scored a hit by making this film again dark and gloomy like his 1989 one.",1
Hey! This movie is not 100 % serious anyway! 'Then I thought :'who cares? < br / > < br / > My opinion : Batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious. My respect is for both directors.,1
Max Shreck later makes Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Its not only creative but its also fun. It has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. The main reason why I like Batman Returns is that its fun. Micheal Keaton is still sharp as Batman. < br / > < br / > Opinion : Batman Returns is a classic.,1
"Here, instead of one villain, there are three. Because it's true to the dark vision of the comic. Why is it better? Bravo Tim Burton and cast! She becomes truly fearsome.",1
"there's not much else to say here except that Keaton is simply the best actor to play Batman ever. he just oozes cool, and he has a kind of Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman, and he is very dark. she also has a tragic background. Gotham city, Batmans hunting ground, is an amazing sight to behold.",1
"So what is'Batman Returns ', anyway? In retrospect, though, it's her scenes < br / > < br / > And then it clicks.",1
"Here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. < br / > < br / > If nothing else, it'at least the best film Tim Burton has ever made. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine.",1
Devito and Walken offer some memorable moments.,1
"< br / > < br / > My Grade : A - Once again, Bugs Bunny sacred home is violated by careless people.",1
"You actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue. Thank you, U. S. Coast Guard and the REAL helicopter rescue swimmers, "" So Others May Live "". I'd highly recommend this movie to everyone. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake.",1
"So this is the last great Batman Film. In Batman Begins we have the scarecrow, whose not nearly as demanding on screen as the penguin or cat woman. Batman Returns holds that crown. You literally can't take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman. Never.",1
"So much like him. She is the BEST Catwoman ever! Tim BUrton directs this picture well, and the locations of the movie are impressive. The villains : Danny deVito is menacing as the Penguin. Michael Keaton acts well as Bruce Wayne, showing he is a good actor.",1
"You see, I always liked the Schumacher films. Later, they have the baby in a small cage.",1
The sets are stunning and immaculate. Tim Burtons direction bring superhero films into new realm.,1
"I don't know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre. I really don't. Catwoman ( a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer! ) But also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions. Dark - yes, bizarre - no.",1
"Batman, for yet another Christmas, remains "" the only lonely man beast in town "". The world he sees is dark, gloomy, and cold. This is life seen through Bruce Wayne's eyes. Somewhere in your psyche, your young tender psychological make up breaks apart. You snap. And hero doesn't get the girl - or cat. It was winter, here in Australia 1992 when I had seen Batman Returns at the cinemas and it blew me away.",1
"Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. He was just great and terrifying! There are memorable characters, lines, and sets! Trust me! With Batman Returns, it came pretty close! Her classic moment of just meeting Batman and The Penguin "" Meow "" is classic! And come on, I mean we've got Michelle in leather!",1
His visual style in this film is at it's best. Forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this. It doesn't fit. But Burton got away with it. And S & M and bondage are presented in a very perverted way. This movie is the Batman phenomenon at its Zenith.,1
"This is the reason why you go to the movies. It's got everything. If so I think the franchise would still be going strong today. Out of all the Bat - films, Batman Returns is my favorite.",1
i like full house and step by step the same. and my most favorite character was Dana.,1
Good Film. £2.,1
It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. I always laugh at that.,1
"Oh, the memories. But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with his Cody character. Duffy rocked! < br / > < br / > That's why I loved "" Step By Step "". Sommers was tender and actually funny.",1
"Marc Singer is totally aware he's in a turkey of a film here, and milks it for everything he can! Pure Shlock Gold! Matthius Hues is sublime in his wooden acting and musclebound moronity ( is that a word?? ) ).",1
"There are some mutants, topless pleasure droids (! Self parody is a very redeeming quality. After watching this film I experienced a new sensation. That actor is Marc Singer!",1
"Therefore it is important to talk about the DVD release instead of just the film. As a film itself, though, not as brilliant as many other Troma productions. But, as I said, not quite my own favorite of all their movies.",1
"Go with it and you'll be in for good time. Trey Parker, Ted Raimi, Julie Strain etc etc.... < br / > < br / > One of the best of recent Troama releases. Lots of cameos, lots of use of the Lesbian Cannibal HoeDown song add to the fun.",1
"It works better than "" Last Tango! "" ? and its educational. So the training begins. Okay so I love Aidan Quinn's acting even with a bad script.",1
A really tight film that shouldn't be overlooked.,1
In Extramarital we see B - actress Traci Lords at her very best.,1
"For example, he's really upset when he kills someone. Most striking of course, was Aidan Quinn's performance. I would never expect to see this fine actor as an action hero. I also noticed that some clichés were avoided.",1
"Occasionally the odd undiscovered gem did make it into his VCR - this being the case with this film. Picture the scene : A bored student with an empty day ahead, A video shop with a special offer of 5 video for a week rentals. Everything about the film is good, but much more than this the parts all mesh to provide something all too rare - a cracking good film. ).",1
"The whole movie, kept me glued to my seat.",1
7 out of ten It has it's moments I guess you would say.,1
"The three leading men - Quinn, Sutherland and Kingsley - carry this film much further than its modest budget would have allowed with anyone else filling their shoes. The Assignment is better than anyone renting it could ever expect, its a pity the film did fairly poorly in the box office, otherwise we might see a sequel to this stupendous espionage thriller. < br / > < br / > 9 / 10 stars, this reviewer HIGHLY recommends it to all potential viewers!",1
"I particularly liked the ending. However,'The Assignment'is well written and has a fascinating story. Aiden Quinn is flawless in dual roles.",1
"Naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of movie. In my opinion, during the final showdown, the payoff wasn't able to match the build - up. He is borne of order and Carlos is borne of chaos. An exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving Ramirez's first name ( Annibal, Annabelle, get it? Ramirez is apparently physically identical to Carlos but mentally he is his antithesis. < br / > < br / > The movie isn't all shoot - gun - jump - around action, and that's a good thing. < br / > < br / > On the It's a little contrived but Quinn gives a riveting performance as a Carlos - wannabe. ).",1
Good spy film and great acting by all actors. There is plenty of car chase scenes and plenty of stunt men situations which I would not want to perform. Most of Sutherland's pictures are full of action and suspense and he can play a rather cruel character and can also be quite charming and kind.,1
The worst was Peter Ustinov! The movie was very good.,1
"The film has a great cast, starring Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. He even has to learn how to make love to a woman the way Carlos would. The action is used only to propel the story of this thriller forward ; no gratuitous explosions or fight scenes. Rating 10 of 10 stars. Because Quinn so closely resembles Carlos, Sutherland stops at nothing to recruit him because Sutherland is obsessed with the terrorist's capture or death. Throughout the film, Quinn must struggle with the new personality he has attained versus his own. The Assignment is based on a true story, which has been somewhat embellished for the big screen, and it really takes you on a fun ride.",1
"'s world manhunt for the infamous'Carlos, the Jackel. Easily one of his best efforts. This movie however, centers on the C. I. Quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of war.",1
"There are a few surprising plot twists. The acting is excellent. ( Well, I jst did. )",1
"look up www. It was front page for weeks, through the trial after his arrest. answers.",1
I loved this film.,1
The very end of it.,1
Great stuff. The movie is worth watching for that shot alone! I will not comment on the story as such.,1
"Things don't exactly play out as planned. In the end, this is one terrific little thriller that deserves your attention. The first half of this fun flick shows Quinn being trained and indoctrinated.",1
The worst was Peter Ustinov! The movie was very good.,1
Director Christian Duguay created a very clever action / spy thriller. The picture was very nice. Believe me you will not be disappointed. It worked!,1
"The Director HAD an idea, that the Crew managed to create on film.",1
It is clever and never dull.,1
"The locations are convincing and effective. * * * 1 / 2 of 4 stars. Ben Kingsley is fine also as the Israeli agent. This is an outstanding thriller, which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release.",1
"So what are you waiting for? I decided to check out what Leonard Maltin gave it, and not surprisingly he gave it * * 1 / 2. So without hesitating I went out and bought it on DVD.",1
"In The Battle at Elderbrush Gulch, the emotional set - up is dealt with briefly but economically. The cart they travel on heads away from the camera, making use of depth and distance to express their moving away from safety and civilization. < br / > < br / > But even a Griffith picture so heavily focused on action would not be without its drama, characterisation and atmospherics. First, we have the scene in which waifs leave their home.",1
The coach arrives in Elderbush Gluch. ).,1
A group of Indians tries to capture the waif's pet dogs and are driven off by the men folk. It is a showcase for Griffith's emerging style. Someone goes for help and returns in the nick of time with the calvary. I have never seen an animal being slain so convincingly on screen. During the confrontation the Indian Chief's son ( Henry B. Wathall ) is killed.,1
It's the exquisite filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level.,1
"Not only is this silly, but seems to play on the prejudices of audiences. Exciting stuff! But, STRANGE, too!",1
The Colonal Funeral Home still looks exactly the same. The truth never has come out to my knowledge. She didn't get name ma for nothing. The story was filmed in Phenix City.,1
"when he was just starting out he was asked by the mob to do financial work for them, but he said that he gently declined. it is very quaint and the scenery depressing. I'm from Phoenix city and the first time i saw this movie and read the book it only confirmed the stories i had heard all of my life.",1
Maybe no one will find this review helpful but it helped me. It made a horrible scene that much worse. When the movie was shown recently it became clearer why it haunted me for years.,1
That major miscalculation on Tanner's part will end up putting an end to both his criminal organization as well as his freedom!,1
The grimness is so relentless that the film is actually difficult to watch.,1
"And what is your point in bringing up Mr. Patterson's employment now? Parts of it were absolutely on target. It has nothing to do with the film that you're supposedly reviewing. My parents lived there and yet, they didn't tolerate it in our household.",1
The film details the return of John Patterson from Germany where he has been a prosecutor. Music by Harry Sukman contributes to the film effectively.,1
The Black and White texture gives a newsree - like quality.,1
A very gritty film. This movie is based on the real story of that fight.,1
This is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of'The Hollow '. Megan Dodds is also very good as Henrietta and Claire Price very affecting as Gerda.,1
You can call me a honky or whitey or whatever! This is an excellent film everyone should see especially children. I grew up in two different places although only 20 miles apart.,1
"When I look for hope, I have Bible... the first most widely read non - fiction book in the world. You really got to know her well through her diary. It's a searing indictment of the Nazis systematic murder of over 6 million Jews, and that should not be forgotten. No doubt she was a very engaging writer, and she did possess an extraordinary talent with expressing herself fully with words.",1
"It details the story of the Frank family, and Anne in particular. High recommended.",1
"I leave that question out there. < br / > < br / > Glenn Close reads selections from the diary and her voice is perfect for the part, she brings a naiveté and freshness to the role. My fascination has also been born of fear, as in, could this happen again. Through the years I've been very much interested in the life of this teenager who left such a profound, indelible mark on the world. A wonderful and respectful film about the seldom seen Anne. < br / > < br / > 10 out of 10.",1
"It's a story that everyone should know. < br / > < br / > Everything changed, though, when I got to the end of the documentary - - - when I saw the motion picture footage of Anne Frank. I think to myself, "" How could someone NOT know the story of Anne Frank? "" I found it to be competent but not extraordinary.",1
"Anyway, Annie can dish it out as well as take it. < br / > < br / >",1
"< br / > < br / > This is a very typical style of film for Mary Pickford. Now if you haven't seen her other films, this isn't an issue. As a result, I had a strong feeling of déjà vu.",1
"The mix of all sorts of kids throughout film are fun to watch. Rating, 8.",1
"< br / > < br / > To give away too much of the plot would not be fair. Production values are very good, with lots of extras making the NYC street scenes quite believable.",1
"< br It is the astonishing visual style of La Antena that really sets it apart from the movies that it pays homage to. It is up to a young family and The Voice's nameless, eyeless son to stop this evil scheme. The result is a roller coaster of a story that is bewildering on occasion but never less than engrossing. La Antena, an audacious film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, succeeds both as a reinvention of the silent movie genre and a gripping cautionary tale. But more subtle references and symbolism lie behind such tributes.",1
"The acting was superb, and the music, as usual, was amazing quality! There was no major difference that I could spot. This movie deserves a 20 / 10 if I could give one. """,1
But it's also sometimes it's downfall.,1
"There is sound, most notably in the almost continuous score by Leo Sujatovich. Fervently. < br / > < br / > La Antena is nothing but pure cinema. It is all expressionist skyscrapers, TV aerials, and animated billboards. And, underlying the whole film is a familiar whirring, as if it were being shown on an ancient projector.",1
< br / > < br / > This movie just blew me away.,1
"The previous reviewer emphasized the quotes from Fritz Lang and Fr. Another example of this kind of reflexion I found in Guy Maddin's Careful, where the inhabitants of a mountain - village have restrictions in using their voices. < br / > < br / > PS : Winners were announced, and the film won the award for best cinematography! I intend to write a paper on it, if you know movies related to this topic, please let me know!!!

"And make no mistake about it, this film belongs into the all - time - 250! Special surgery in the US would cost 1. Sounds corny? Let me put it this way : This film rocks like no kid - film and few others did before. No, but this actually is IT! And there's a whole lot more to it than just the "" action "".",1
"The story? Yes i do believe it is THAT good. < br / > < br / > Regards Klav. Try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year child with a nappy, on your arm : - ). that it can bear comparison with OE. It is a movie both for children and parents, and it is "" timeless "".",1
"This satire is just really, really dead - on, and nobody is spared. And the actors aren't even exaggerating that much I suppose.",1
A very enjoyable film if you really like the acting of David Suchet as Mr. Poiro!,1
"Plus, playing a funny Hitler is hard for me to take. Watch the film for this reason alone. < br / > < br / > The movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. This was Charlie Chaplin's first all - talking film.",1
"This was Chaplin's first all - talking picture, and the results are mixed. There are lots of meaningless bits that drag on. It is flawed, but Chaplin is in great form. If this was a silent, it probably would not have happened. One of the most touching moments is, obviously, the speech at the end.",1
"< br / > < br / > This was a very good movie, and well worth watching. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. But the movie picks up steam quickly. The climax of the film is a brilliant anti - Nazi speech given by Chaplin at the end of the movie.",1
"All great satire is based on going out on an edge. So, let me watch film first.",1
"What was also well done was the way in which Hitler is spoofed. < br / > < br / > Historically, the film got a few things right as well. ).",1
"Here were have two - the sexy sinuous Megan Doods and the stunning Lysette Anthony. In a better civilization, this and many other of the David Suchet movies would be released in theaters. It'impossible to over - praise them - and I had never seen one before a few months ago nor read an Agatha Christie.",1
"The "" good news "" is that the circus is in town. I mean, it's not everyday you can see lion on a trapeze, or doing a hula dance! The lion sniffs food, and by process of elimination, figures out it's a rabbit.",1

"I loved Hynkels ( Hitlers ) bursts of raging German with the nice subtle English translation. At the beginning I had to hold in laughter when he drops the very crafty looking Hand Grenade down his sleeve. Though the film is sixty eight years old the final scene is still relevant today, if this doesn't show how great a writer Chaplin is, then I don't know what will. < br / > < br / > The final scene is wildly discussed because, well it's absolutely true, and so very intelligently constructed.",1
"The film was also nominated for best picture. Henry Daniell is his usual staid self as Garbitsch, chief adviser to Adenoid Hynkel. The film traces Hitler's experiences in the German army from World War I up to the present day. The catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer.",1
"It is notorious for it's blatant satire of Adolf Hitler and Nazism. It isn't "" covert "", it has no business being covert. "" Just watch it, you'll see it.",1
"Chaplin's satire with several classics scenes, he has dual role as a Jewish barber and dictator Hynkel, an offensive portrayal of Hitler. Then the barber is mistaken for the Hitlerian tyrant and happen bemusing events. Chaplin's first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by Karl Struss.",1
"Final score : 8 / 10. < br / > < br / > Finally, the whole of the Great Dictator. Well, to be honest, it had its moments, both of comedy and of drama. The final speech that the Jewish barber gives is enormously powerful. But these moments don't always mix well.",1
"Hynkel is the absolute double for the Jewish Barber, who comes back from fighting in the war. The film is about Hitler in all the glory of comedy.",1
"At this point, Hynkel himself has been arrested by his armed forces, thinking him to be the notorious barber. Albeit Chaplin started production on the film in 1937, it can be forgiven some naivete.",1
"They are words that have meaning now, and in any time of war. But Chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything. Drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did.",1
I think this movie is one of best ever done.,1
Nice to see him after a few years. What I loved in the ` Hollow'was that it's a mystery the old fashioned way. Suchet is amazing as always and fortunately is on screen most of the time. It's set on a country house on a weekend. Everybody seems to be the culprit. < br / > < br / > The actors are all very good.,1
"The necessity to murder Hynkel presages the assassination attempt against Hitler by his generals... In a state of delirium, he begins to say ridiculous words...",1
"< br / > < br / > This film is hilarious, poignant and tragic. This film entered production before WW2 began, but was not released until it was well under way.",1
What makes a man?,1
"I loved this movie! Or, maybe you just like a good British romp?",1
"This movie is playing on HERE TV, but if you don't have satellite, it is worth rent. So give it a try ; you won't be disappointed. juts not the way you would expect ). but it does involve two guys and one girl. I am mostly a scifi movie watcher, but I would be more than happy to add this one to my collection.",1

It was a fun film to look at.,1
"enjoy..... i´m aware of the paradox here : homo - a n d hetereosexual.... this is something the film tackles on end, but never uses for caricature.",1
This movie was a pleasant surprise because I didn't expect much. James Purefoy is great in this and Jennifer Ehle sweet and wonderful.,1
Maybe even Kevin McKidd looks a little pale compared to his co - actors but it benefits his somewhat subdued character. < br / > < br / > Leo identifies as gay but ends up falling for a woman as well who turns out to be his teenage sweetheart and Brendon's long time girlfriend. < br / > < br / > What I like about this movie is its genuinely positive notion. Brendon starts out straight but gets to learn that gay may be more than just an option for him and being bisexual might not be that bad after all.,1
"They also go on a'hunter gather'weekend with hilarious results. Trust me, you'll laugh your teeth out.",1

A really enjoyable experience.,1

And not just for gay audiences. It makes you think a bit while waiting to see what happens. I highly recommend this film! I was impressed by the story.,1

"What is one supposed to do while waiting? I thought that was so cool. It blows me away. This is not perfect, it is a movie after all.",1
The film is LONG overdue. LATTER DAYS exposes the Mormon's persecution of gay members.,1
I give my most heartfelt praise for this fabulous and courageous story. I have nothing but good things to say about this tasteful and heartwarming film.,1

The acting is OK, nothing special. He wants nothing more with killing, but is eventually won over by Li Gong ( who wouldn't be? )",1
It was visually stunning. I think this speaks to the film's quality.,1
Crack House ( 1989 ) was one of the few film during the 80's that falls into this genre. There's nothing wrong with that however. One of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl. Luke from General Hospital makes a guest star spot as well.,1

Ryan's about to lose his shirt as a result of all the shenanigans. Plus a rather interesting scheme of sharecropping. < br / > < br / > A good addition to Randolph Scott collection of westerns. Anne Jeffreys does sing nice though.,1
Be sure to see this one.,1
"Alexander Knox ( the Longest Day ) is her hubby Max. War story written for the wives'point of view, which wasn't too common in those days.",1
"When Kanin joined the military during WWII, Gordon soon wrote and starred in the play that became this film. Additionally, the acting all around is very good. In OVER 21, the pair play husband and wife.",1
"This was not an uncommon theme in those years. Knox has graduated to not only editor, but featured columnist. The film bears very little trace of its stage origins. In fact Garson Kanin directed both of them in My Favorite Wife a few years earlier.",1
This film is a perfect example. She could tackle any part.,1
"Watching Irene Dunne is a delight! A light, uplifting and engaging movie.",1
"However, cast with Dunne and Coburn, he holds his own. He delivers a fine, nuanced performance. This role is quintessential Irene Dunne, full of pathos and wit and a little mischief. Their scenes are very well done. She is simultaneously authentic and human, AND a charismatic, inspirational model. Not the usual WWII movie! < br / > < br / > I am not as familiar with Knox's work. He was recognizable, but that was about all. They never miss a beat.",1
Van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins. A Texas cop battles smugglers. The story was average. I like the shepherd! Van damme was never a good actor.,1
"What a gal! Why she remains so little known is a mystery. The script, based on the play, is spicy, rich, and completely undated. This little - known comedy from the hit play by Ruth Gordon is a delight. Ditto the cast but I must underline the work of the leading lady, Irene Dunne.",1
Never has there been a better blending of B / W and colour in a film.,1
"< br / > < br / > Seven out of Ten for trying, and out of respect for the ANZAC's. I have to question whether they should have bothered. We went to the cinema expecting a biggish budget release and got an art - house movie.",1
"So, the history is followed by British, Australian and Turkish soldiers. I was not disappointed. Intens.",1
"That is the legacy of the event of Gallipoli. The lack of brutal depictions of violence are just and proper. It is honest, true and brave, just like the men that fought and died at the Hellespont. They never wished to ever see such scene's again.",1
"Those who go expecting a documentary are impressed, or at least not disappointed.",1

"}, this is a hugely enjoyable piece that is quintessential 1970s. 7 rating here on IMDb, but just how many people have seen it i wonder?, hmm, go on give it a go if you the chance, it'good stuff. 7 / 10 < br / > < br / > Also known as The Mayfair Bank Caper { amongst others!",1
I would like to see a good director put Van Damme on the big screen with a good plot.,1
A gem of a British caper - comedy. Two fine actors we've lost that I wish we had back.,1

The region 1 copy I is very poor quality. Let's hope they've cleaned it up.,1
"All the more surprising given how ill Niven was at the time. He also manages to be surprisingly menacing and intimidatingly dangerous. < br / > < br / > Alongside him you can spot numerous familiar faces from seventies cinema and television. It never pretends to be a masterpiece, but it's a mini - gem of late seventies British comedy. Delightful!",1
"look for the current stars of coronation street then playing crowd scenes or extras. A good film, great crew, superb cast. A restaurant was suddenly turned into a funeral parlour. If you see the film on the listings make an effort to see it!",1
"I recently bought this movie on DVD at a discount store for $ 5. He portrays an American in England. NO blood. Just a well written story, well acted, well directed and well photographed!",1
"He has played corrupt cop in THE FRIENDS OF EDDY COYLE, a sadistic killer in THE MEAN SEASON. He seemed to get stuck in supporting roles and B movies, not a fair representation of his acting ability.",1
"I seem to think it was read on radio 4, but i can't find that either.",1
Yet the drama was all the more convincing for that. But it remains clear as anything in my mind.,1
"The bad guys are awesome like in Hard Target, and the fight scenes are "" old school "". I must say, I gave up on him, but Van Dam is finally back. More Please.... Real fans know what to expect.",1

"< br / > < br / > Precious Bane is a British Broadcasting Corporation adaptation of the highly acclaimed novel by Mary Webb. Pru has to not only contend with her facial disfigurement, but also the constant snides and hurt from the ignorant villagers.",1
And Prue. What a man!,1
A story that changed my life.,1
< br / > < br / > I really can't recommend this highly enough.,1
Get this DVD please! Come on BBC - you have money to make off us fans here.,1
"In the event I needn't have worried at all. Such a simple thing, when they went to so much trouble for everything else. If you get chance, see this, it is excellent.",1
< br / > < br / > In meantime we will have to content ourselves with our recollections of how wonderful they were. If anyone learns otherwise I would love to hear from them.,1
"Be sure to give this one try, you will not be disappointed. Like Steven Seagal I also am a big Van Damme fan and have followed most of his movies since the start of his acting career. The action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing.",1
This is a great TV miniseries of a classic novel. Thanks!,1
"This is a movie I can watch again and again. Especially when a lot of bad luck befalls her family. She is strong and courageous but shies away from Kester Woodseaves, a traveling weaver who catches her eye.",1
It's beautifully filmed and acted.,1
"Is he friend or foe? < br / > < br / > Keep an ear out for Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson. But as two different set of talking animal siblings make their rounds, they are stalked by the henchmen of Jamal - but who is Jamal?",1
I was - Unlike most of the reviewers - not born in the 80's. The winning team would then receive a 100. I was born on may 14th 1994. His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks help him pack.,1
"And no chipmunk movie is complete without the odd renditions of classic rock and pop anthems. The jokes and humour is typical chipmunk standard and the narrative is spot - on. Bagdarasian and Karman provide the helium - like voices of the film's trio. In truth, The Chipmunk Adventure is everything the live action movie ought to have been, but isn't.",1
Years later i can still sing every word to every song.,1
"IMHO, JCDV may really be on to something going forward. In this case, JCVD is THE talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film. One of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a Desperado rip off. This stuff happens all the time. Directors are paid to do a job. I am sure he got a film that he was happy with. JCVD rocks!! Made it seem more real.",1
This movie is a classic. I love it.,1
"This was one of the best movies you could find as a child. And when found at the airport by the villains, a chase ensues! If you see this, share with your kids ( if you got any!",1
< br / > < br / > The Animation is amazing and to watch hand - drawn animation is a real breath of fresh air to all the computer animation we see today. The Backgrounds are stunning and the coloring is amazing.,1
"AWWWW, I just love this movie to bits. Such geart times!",1
"Alvin's really the star and has all the cool looks. Neither one of the Chipmunks has any bad traits. I also like the Chipettes a lot. Theodore is the lovable sensitive one. < br / > < br / > This adventurous movie has a lot of great songs. "" Alvin and Brittany accept it and go on the race. """,1

David Seville is the Chipmunks'father and recording manager. I saw it theatrically.,1
The Chipettes'were definitely sexualized tenfold for this movie.,1
"The only real problem I have with this film is title ; "" The Shepherd ""? The Sheperd : Border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action / fight sequences. < br / > < br / > i. e. It's good for a Van Damme film. I don't get it!",1
"< br / > < br / > Every joke is cute, sincere and amusing. Highlights include the Chipettes in a slightly risqué Arabian dance to calm snakes. But for me, it will always be a little known masterpiece.",1
One of my absolute favorite childhood films. It's too bad they don't make them like this anymore.,1
"This is certainly a good film, beautifully photographed and evocatively acted. Yet one should certainly criticize it, and Mizoguchi, for it is not without flaws and weaknesses. This is certainly a case in'the Crucified Lovers ','Princess Yang Kwei Fei'and'Zankiku monogatari '.",1
"I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago. Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1 - 10 scale. Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must - have.",1
"Anne cannot stand the fact that their father have cut the cords with Lionel and therefore she run away from home. As this wasn't enough, the son Greg ( Brian Krause "" Charmed "" ) enlists in the marines and is sent to war. Not always that good, but as good as she can.",1
"< br / > < br / > Yes, people in costumes. Just about the time school started. < br / > < br / > Oh, I do love much of the movie. There was the fire - breather again.",1
"No wonder my older brother was keen to take me to the cinema to see this one!. And guys,! You know the kind, the memories that never leave you.",1
A complete campy riot. Another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clutching doll in its slavering jaws.,1
"Van Damme says some humorous lines and shows that he's improving as an actor. A must rent for JCVD fans. Nok Su Kow! Scott Adkins is great in his role and Van Damme and him have a 1 on 1 showdown at the end. Overall, it's one of Van Damme's better films and it will keep you entertained.",1
"Bugs later ended up in the circus in "" Big Top Bunny "". I recommend this one.",1
"yummy! The mole, what a machine!",1
I went home to the safety of my family. This has it all! Superb.,1
The studio productions were very good and very elaborate. All in all quite watchable for its time and fun now.,1
Nice. Scary stuff.,1
"It may be crap, but is definitely good crap.",1
CONTEXT is everything when one goes to rate a movie. AWESOME.,1
I enjoyed it. This is one of Van Damme's best works.,1
"At least it has Caroline Munro, which no CGI fx can evercreate. She's effing sexy in this movie. Gimme AT THE EARTH'S CORE over any turgid STAR WARS prequels any time! < br / > < br / > Seriously, anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't know what fun is. As Yoda would say, Fun they're not! ), the inspired teaming of Peter Cushing ( who's great! )",1
Not high art but definitely great Saturday matinée fun.,1
"Imagine GUN CRAZY scripted by Steinbeck - it's that good. "" Cochran was never more vulnerable, Roman never sexier.",1
"And the ending, while unconvincing, is nonetheless welcome.",1
"However, I found myself watching many of the bits with unease.",1
"It makes Jurassic Park look small weedy. If you're a dino - fan, then this IS for you.",1
How about a theatrical release?,1
"( Spoliers!!!!! ) Awesome job! When I first saw this film, it was like I really had traveled back in time.",1
They think which color they had. I am also interesting in how the dinosaurs behave.,1
"So run for the Damme border! For further evidence check out "" Undisputed 2 "". The action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with Van Damme's best. This is the best direct - to - DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet. The reason he does is very cool but you don't find out until the very end. Overall though, this is a solid action movie that I recommend.",1
"The music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it needs to be. Walking with Dinosaurs "" is absolutely brilliant in every regard. < br / > < br / > In conclusion, this is a must watch. """,1
"< br / > < br / > My dream came true. Nobody was there. If you wanna stick to what we know for sure, then just go visit dinosaur bones museum. Of course the dinosaurs were great, but the story - telling was unnecessary.",1
"I saw this series in 1999 in London TV and was blown away. < br / > < br / > I highly recommend to watch this series before going into upcoming Disney Dinosaur movie or watching any Jurassic Park ( like ) movie again. The CG are very lifelike, and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats shown makes it also very educational. The Disney Trailers looked especially bad.",1
Super.,1
"Walking With Dinosaurs shows us the real animals in their real habitats all those millions of years ago. When Jurassic Park first came out, it was revolutionary in filmaking and special effects. The amount of detail and scientific information used in this is great. These dinosaurs walk, run, feed, fight, breed, hunt and swim.",1
"I can't believe how much I enjoyed it! For what it is, its an A! It is amazingly realistic and believable. In some cases, you will actually be convinced that you've seen a dinosaur.",1
"It will also entertain the hell out of them, and you. Your brain will thank you. This is as good as it gets.",1
"Some basic drama, but nothing too deep. No Oscars here for sure, but you already knew that.",1
The quality of the sound and video is terrific. < br / > < br / > Not so in the case of WWD. I prefer the Branugh version simply because it is more complete. And of course the story and content... what more could a dinosaur lover ask for? many kudos to the BBC and the crew that made this gem.,1
This is what science is all about. < br / > < br / > 10 stars.,1
An 8. Will Lois be able to warn Superman? What do you think?,1
"That goes for the theme ( overture ) as well as all the multi - mood background ( incidental ) music. The existing series ( Popeye, Superman ) continued as if nothing at all had transpired. Early on, the finished product of Famous was indiscernible from that of the recent output by Fleischer. < br / > < br / > < br / > < br / > TODAY'S subject, JAPOTEURS is one of the earlier Famous Studio's SUPERMAN Shorts.",1

).,1
"There's also good suspense, as Sales disappears just as the trial is about to begin. Fear of his grandson's death is no excuse, he says.",1
Recommended. Wel worh your time to watch if you get the opportunity.,1
"I mean this is Van Damme. I have never seen her before so that was a nice treat. The fights were good, and i said "" hah, awesome "" out loud a few times. Next time though, add more hand to hand combat! < br / > < br / > All in all, this movie is not half bad. We don't really expect much of an amazing plot do we?",1
"This is a tough stuff, to say the least. This is one of those films that looks so "" dated "" that being that way is part of the fun. You see and hear things you would NEVER see or hear on the silver screen today. There are a bunch of laughs for all those who view this unique crime film.",1

"This movie is apparently intended for a young, evangelical Christian audience as a teaching tool. For any other audience, I'd rate it lots lower. He is the most unlikeable angel I have ever seen in any movie, and the biggest negative. I was more reminded of a "" Chick Tract "", those little 3 "" by 5 "" gospel comic books. For that I give it a 7 out of 10 point vote. ( I admit that he reminded me of someone I know. )",1
It's a LAUGH RIOT!,1
5 % or less of the movie's wonderful effect on the viewer. < br / > < br / > I can't wait to get the soundtrack!,1
I loved this film almost as much as the origional version!,1
"So if you haven't seen the movie, why standing there? This movie is a very worthy successor to the original classic "" Lady and the Tramp "". !",1
"am sure this will kill time if you are action fan. Well it is a good movie. Maybe, one day : ).",1
"( This is, of course, my personal opinion. ) He is voiced to PERFECTION by Scott Wolf. Lady and Tramp have not aged a day since 1955. Then there is Scamp ( who is the spitting image of his dad ). Danny Troob's score is okay, but nothing memorable.",1
This movie is excellent!,1
"I love little Scamp, and the street - wise Angel. I thought that this is a wonderfully written movie.",1
Another good animation from Disney.,1
"Very good, but still had flaws. < br / > < br / > I give it 7 / 10. I also like Lady and Tramp's voices more in this.",1
"Also, where the hell was Lady? No. adorable! Compared to the original does it hold up? I enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie. The animation was kind of scary at times. Where do I begin? It was, ( flame - shield up! )",1
"Hilarious film, I had a great time watching it.",1

Scorpion "" ) and this time she's out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back. The plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge. Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima ( a. k. a. """,1
"All sorts of plot twists'can be applied in these types of stories. It was a disappointing part of the episode. As sci - fi fans know, no characters really ever have to'die'in time travel episodes.",1
"The twilight zone has thus far not struck me for its complex sets or high production values. He had a business card, after all, how bad could he be?",1
"Time travel into the past is tenuous at best as a topic. Of course, he is thought to be quite mad. He is arrested and eventually remanded to the very man he is attempting to stop.",1
"Mr. Tawky Tawny also made his on screen debut. As such, the stories were very imaginative and inventive. let's start with Hero High.",1
"The actors who voiced the characters, also dressed has there characters in the show.",1

And the overall tone and atmosphere keeps changing with each new episode as well.",1
"So for just Lena Horne alone, The Duke is Tops is worth seeing at least once. He then teams up with Doc Dorando ( Lawrence Criner ) for a series of medicine shows throughout the south. Guess what happens?",1
An unusual film for an audience outside the USA. A must for all film buff.,1
"Claude does not want to part from his wife, but she runs away from him. < br / > < br / > Its a good film. As a result, Toni is let off the hook. There is a tense, exciting build - up to the finale. The cast are all very good in their roles, especially Francis Lederer's portrayal of Claude. Are they going to get away.....??...",1
"It is, indeed, high praise to be compared to Robert Krasker's academy award - winning cinematography in The Third Man. All in all, I thought this film was a fine little gem, and I wondered why I had not seen it before. This similarity strikes the viewer almost immediately. As it stands, it seems like an afterthought - a mild surprise, in fact - tacked on to the end. This sub - plot should have been made more apparent as the story unfolded. The acting is always more restrained and subtle. I found it highly creative and entertaining. It is the unexpected turns that make this film much fresher, more original and engrossing than a plot synopsis might convey. Instead, it relies on constant, smaller surprises. In short, the Mistaken Identity device is rather common ; but this plot is not.",1
"What to do? Needless to say that would be too simple. Buka takes the man's luggage in and returns to the car. He now has an American passport and plenty of cash! Camden breaks down when hubby Lederer shows up at the police station. Waiting at the hotel is the dead man's mistress, Joan Camden. He survives by driving a friend's cab at night. His ticket to freedom! The film was produced by actor Turhan Bey. Call the police? He drops by an underworld contact to have the passport photo changed. If he gets caught it means three months in jail.",1
"When Buka returns to his cab, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat. < br / > < br / > Well worth viewing.",1
"< br / > < br / > My rating : 8 out 10. The young hero is very sympathetic and provides a good protagonist to root for. Otherwise a great movie. Hong Kong, the 1920s. It's all - out Karate Kid style with "" wash the wok "" instead of "" wax on, wax off "".",1

"< br / > < br / > There is an intense emotion in every scene. This movie can be summed up ( albeit inadequately ) in one word : "" RAW "". I have been feeling a little disappointed by Tarantino ever since death proof. No punches are held back, and the Nazis are often shown being tortured.

I love the actor's lack of vanity. Lots of fun.,1
"That is until "" Inglorious Basterds. "" I watched it when I was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film. Even more rarely do I clap at the end of a movie, this I and everyone else in the theater did. < br / > < br / > The acting was superb!! < br / > < br / > However, since then Quentin has not really lived up to his billing. < br / > < br / > So let's look at movie which I won't give away. THIS FILM DID NOT Disappoint. The writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie.",1
"And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English. I'll put it short : Finally, QT is back. Obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. And I'm both from Germany and into movies.",1

Hoping to see him in something again soon! ! He definitely deserved his prize at Cannes and is heading for an Oscar no doubt!!!,1
"He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and thankfully so. I couldn't wait to see him on screen again. ( Fictional of course ) A war film hasn't been done like this before. Since, he has been a disappointment for some. < br / > < br / > War has never been been so fun. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. Their goal - killin'Nazi's. The entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. The film was filled with noteworthy performances. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. It isn't meant to be a documentary.",1
"The thing of it is, in French "" vache "" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. In the process, Tarantino fixes one of The Dirty Dozen's major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the Nazis were. And LaPadite understands his meaning all too well.",1

Nami finds an ally in hooker Yuki ( Yayoi Watanabe ), who provides her a temporary shelter.",1
< br / > < br / > Easily Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph. I had not expected to like this film. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q & A following in London. < br There were a couple of great characters.,1
"Bad Bravo! Foley's a nut, but in a good way. You never know what self depricating humor he's going to come up with next.",1
Well worth watching. The creepiest ending for an MGM short that I can recall. Think a Tom and Jerry cartoon directed by Tim Burton.,1
What more could you ask for. This is a story of real true love. What else can i say about this great movie. She loves him so much.,1
"Both were good movies, but I really liked both books better. The time lines don't match up either.",1

Scarlett doesn't stay in Georgia for long, she runs off to Charleston in her quest to win him back. She soon gets her divorce notice from Rhe A storm comes up and they sink. Terrified that she has died, Rhett is anxious until she awakes. We were riveted! Rhett is not happy when he finds Scarlett in his home so he leaves for the family's plantation.",1
"From then of, book and series slowly split ways. Unfortunately, the producer found no Scarlett amongst these actresses. Scarlett now carries a secret. And... there are some big shoes to fill. It is by far the movie of all movies.",1
It's also weird to see a different Scarlett.,1
It was a completely different story.,1
"This is an awesome film. It's much slower, much more contemplative.",1
This was one of Jimmy Smit best roles in my opinion.,1
"No one will every be Vivien Leigh or Clark Gable. Watch it for that alone. Obviously, this was a high budget TV miniseries. If one views this on its own merit ( and not immediately following the original ), it comes out pretty good.",1

"Timothy Dalton was great as Rhett, though no one will ever replace Clark Gable. This is a sequel of sorts. I am a huge Gone With the Wind fan, and I read "" Scarlett "" before it was a miniseries and loved it.",1
I fell in love for this dramatic story.,1
": ) Overall, I enjoyed the movie Scarlett. Dalton also portrayed Rhett well at times. I am a huge fan of Gone with the Wind.",1
"I tried guys, I really tried! A letter to the guys. Whalley plays a delightful Scarlett. I tried so hard not to watch this movie.",1
I loved the movie. I love both SCARLETT AND GWTW!,1
The scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie. It is just one persons opinion about what could have happened after Rhett left Scarlett at Tara.,1
"I have not seen GRUDGE SONG yet ( but soon will... ) so I don't know how it stacks up to the previous FP films - but it will be interesting to see. The story is somewhat confusing and convoluted at times, but a lot of these 70's era pinky films are - and I still love them.",1

And then of course there'Sean Bean as the cold, calculating and not to mention, almost demonically evil Lord Fenton, Mary's nemesis and Scarlett's eventual violator. Joanne Whalley Kilmer ( no longer Kilmer having been divorced from ex - hubby Val Kilmer ) plays her own Scarlett and although this is a sequel and not a re - make ( God - forbid!!! ) Timothy Dalton should have had no accent whatsoever, due to the fact that both Margaret Mitchell's Rhett and Gable in the film had none. < br / > < br / > It's common knowledge and has been said before : No one can ever play Scarlett and Rhett like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.",1
"I've always loved "" Gone With The Wind "" and have seen it numerous times. Julie Harris was her usual delightful presence, and Jean Smart was an adorable kick! Thankfully, someone finally did.

"the crowning achievement of the movie is when the young kid returns home. Its a Marathi movie, n I cant make out apple from orange in marathi. Now I am no judge of cinematic techniques and acting skills.",1
It was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie. No MPAA member is willingly going to suffer through 4 hours of jingoistic drama and lot of song and dance. He kept the narrative simple to comprehend and made sure all the actors are true to the characters that they are supposed to portray.,1
Every bit of action has some meaning in it.,1
"I will surely recommend to anyone! Dialogues like "" mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe "" ( My parsha is also one in a million ) enhance the emotion. < br / > < br / > Shwaas explores, in intricate detail, the relationship between a grandparent and a child. And it does complete justice to this strong bond. Its a movie that has left a profound effect on me.",1
It is a must watch. Shwaas is awesome!,1

"and the scene at the end is beautiful. Also as it goes the acting is very good, it is subtle because that is how Jayne Austen writes! < br / > < br / > People seem to prefer the 1995 version for some reason that I can not comprehend!.",1
"Still, this shouldn't detract from a hugely enjoyable Austen adaptation.",1
Here is one of Jane Austen's movies that I found very delightful. The joy of knowing that Anne is evidently reunited with a lost love.,1
"They were believable. I finally found a version of Persuasion that I like! Why it isn't rated higher is beyond my comprehension. They created real characters, and it was like the characters in the book came to life. It's worth the price and worth the wait.",1
"So it was with great anticipation that I popped the disc into my player. This is Anne Elliot, as brought to life by Anne Firbank. < br / > < br / > I wasn't disappointed, either. I knew there were bound to be some draw - backs, so I'll state them, and try not to be too thick about them. There are passages in the book where Anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. < br / > < br / > Captain Wentworth's portrayal is ably handled by Bryan Marshall. This can leave the feeling that the film is slow, and lacking in purpose.",1

In the equally brilliant first sequel, "" Joshuu Sasori : Dai - 41 zakkyo - bô "" Ito added more surrealism and symbolism. Once again, "" Best Stable "" is both very artistic and very Exploitation - like.",1
The China Syndrome once again became a relevant movie. Stupidity and greed though are commodities found every day. The problem with them is that there are places where it can be tolerated less in human society. Still I could have seen a young Kirk Douglas in this part.,1
"And even if you refute that claim, you can't dispute that all humans are prone to make mistakes. Highly politically charged drama that, while biased, is extremely well - handled and one of the most intelligent films ever made.",1

"Because this one scores on every level. < br / > < br / > It has an intelligent, believable script. I wish Hollywood would make more movies like The China Syndrome.",1
One of the best endings ever. Though it was not even nominated.,1
"They may be stars, but they're actors first. < br / > < br / > There is no music score in the film. He is simply presenting the material straightforward. It has the type of ending that's so unexpected, but yet so logical. It focuses on the characters and story rather than style. The China Syndrome "" is thrilling in a way no one would expect.",1
"Syndrome "", however, is more of a thriller than a drama. And that very last scene - I won't give it away, of course - but it will keep you guessing. The risks are simply too high. ( In fairness, that case was probably more one of incompetence than of corruption. )",1
"It'a good movie with a pretty good ending. Douglas is an independent cameraman and Lemmon is a supervisor at a nuclear plant. Everyone tries to cover it up except Fonda and Douglas, so Douglas steals the film.",1
"Not so much a WIP movie as the bulk of the film has Scorpion and six other escaped inmates on lam. This one plays out as much more of a crime drama. I very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series. Once again, our heroine is on the run. But I found it to be engaging from beginning to end.",1
"I doubt however it will survive the test of time. It might not be entirely forgotten thanks to its cast, but otherwise dialog, setting and score will make a remake of this movie unavoidable.",1

I sincerely doubt that there are any conspiracies afoot there. < br / > < br / > This movie seems intended as a nuclear scare tactic. His facial expressions speak volumes here.,1
"Lemmon shines over all as Jack., his performance is highly charged drama. Jack Godell, head of the control room, prevents the reactor from disaster. Reporter Kimberly Wells presents the minor side of the news ; puff pieces that don't hold much news merit.",1

I loved this show.,1
"< br / > < br / > Grade : + < br / > < br / > With a red - headed Jane Fonda as a news reporter and a bearded Michael Douglas as her camera man ( and the film's producer, by the way ). "" As watchable as it is, it's certainly no classic.",1
This one is about an accident at a Neuclear Reactor and of the attempts to cover it up.,1
"He has the gift to be able to communicate so much, at times without saying a word. The political drama is effective, if not especially new or inspired. And it does. It is absolutely astonishing to watch him at work. The terror in his eyes is one of the most frightening images I have seen in any film.",1
"I was only 17 and it scared me silly. Lemmon is ( as always ) excellent. Don't miss this one! He was rightfully nominated for an Academy Award for this. Wells, Adams and Godell find all their lives are in danger.",1
- - - IMDb Rating : 7.,1
All the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come.,1
"That is what the film is saying ; and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way, it says it brilliantly. But he can't get anyone who works with him to believe his story. Fundamentally, nuclear power can NEVER be made safe because people can NEVER be perfect.",1
"That is merely a lead - in, a way of starting the film ( though it's used later ). The lack of a score is perfect ; no music is needed to enhance. The entire film has that pace ; not slow or drawn - out, but deliberate. The writing was excellent. The subject is extremely important to be aware of, and it's handled perfectly here. Soon after, Fonda's character's typical story is shown, in that same angle.",1
* * * 1 / 2 from * * * *,1
"If you like movies, you won't be disappointed. The characters portray all of this far better than the music ever could.",1
"Come on, face it, if they didn't die they would be invincible. Should we not see how much we enjoyed it? Should we look at the final season instead of the total?",1
"Sam Waterston and Ted Danson are fine in their roles as well, doing a decent job with the stereotypical buddy relationship. This interesting storyline has all the elements for a good "" chick flick.",1

So they make up an imaginary life for him and eventually kill him off.,1
"And very few people were named. Two identical servants scrub the floor. As the tsar is in a hurry to see the order, there's no time to correct the mistake.",1
Better this than the depressing 1919 Anders al die Andern.,1
This created movies as we know it today!,1
"This is a pretty interesting experiment to watch. It's probably the reason why people hesitate to call this movie the first ever sound picture. It's the first ever, still existing attempt, to unite sight with sound.",1
"In order to show that this was a motion picture, two of Edison's "" Black Maria "" laboratory decided to do a little dance in front of the camera. The idea was to record the song into cylinder at the same time that the camera was recording his movements. So Dickson kept experimenting and this short experiment, Kinetophone's first film, was the result.",1
"< br / > < br / > If only this series could have ended at season 4 and picked up later by SyFy... I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.",1
"Go ahead! Recently, curators located the wax cylinder, which had broken into several pieces. These were reassembled : a playback was obtained, and the sound was digitised. The silent image ( recorded at 40 fps ) has been in the Library of Congress for years, known to film historians as a mute curiosity. The very first talking picture has returned from oblivion, and now you can hear it and see it! Sound and image are synchronised at last!

"< br / > < br / > Ray Charles was born to a single mother in a poor black community in Georgia in 1930. The best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks to Charles'childhood. All these matters are emphasised in both films. Both achieved success in the 1950s. Both lost a brother in an accident during childhood. There are also similarities with Ron Howard's "" A Beautiful Mind "".",1
"Very good! It was number 99 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. It is a great story with a great singer impression, the songs, including Hit the Road Jack, are the highlights.",1
Biographic movie. He is truly Sensational! This movie came as a Total Surprise to me.,1
"Ray has love for all kind of music, including Country. 1 Surround Sound. Ray is an smart man as well.",1
He lives his role. A real lesson.,1
"True Suspence. Ok, everybody agreed on what was the best season. Also killing off others was bad. Bad boys. He is really... mysterious. BUT.",1
Ray Charles is legendary.,1
"I have to say that Jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles to life brilliantly. The point is that drugs did just that, and to honour his mother's memory, he had to beat them. His drug addiction and extra marital affairs are also well documented.",1
"His mother also sent him to school as well. Jamie Foxx did an incredible job playing Ray Charles. When Ray Charles was little, he went blind and his mother didn't baby him.",1
"He even sings like Ray!. When all was said and done, I was disappointed by how routine it seemed at times. Ray's biggest problem had to be the over length. < br / > < br / > Bottom Line. I have to say, Jamie is the reason I got through this movie. He was humble back then, and somewhat a gentleman. The 1st half is a lot better then the 2nd.",1
"< br / > < br / > Intrigued as I was, I glanced at my watch more than once. And surely there was more humour in his life than we're treated to here? They should do the same with this year's Best Actor gong. But for a life so unique, the film seems incredibly formulaic and familiar. Otherwise, we'd buy the albums.",1
"I saw Ray when it first came out. Why? And in this film, I did. Same with "" What's Love Got To Do With It "" and "" Bird "". With Jamie Foxx's performance. I cannot say it was a "" great "" film. I expect more outa cinema.",1
It worked beautifully. He wasn't always a nice man. I pick Jamie for Best Actor! Jamie Foxx was the epitome of Ray Charles.,1
"My vote is nine. I like Ray Charles, I was not his fan, but it is amazing the resemblance of Jamie Foxx with him.",1
Ray Charles was a genius. < br / > < br / > There are some lives that deserve to be transformed on the silver screen. Ray was a complicated man. His fear was because of his guilt.,1
"Questions arise : just why are they here? Earth : The Final Conflict was proof! Still, the first Season remains intriguing and fun to watch. The main liaison on Earth between the races is Da'an ( Leni Parker ) and he is to many, the most trustworthy Taelon. Gene Roddenberry never let his fans down.",1
"These themes create a unifying drama which span the length of his long and illuminated life. < br / > < br / > Recommended for everyone. The themes are carried forward with power and human dignity. And nothing was sugar - coated in "" Ray. "" Foxx doesn't just play Charles, he re - creates him.",1
"The man had supreme confidence in himself but didn't come across as arrogant about it. To the film's credit, it shows both the good and the bad regarding Charles'character and the choices he made, both personally and professionally. Not only does it look good, it sounds good. Jamie Foxx does a fine job of impersonating the famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles. That's just amazing. < br / > < br / > This is a slick - looking film that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place. Also memorable was showing him beating his heroin addiction - with no help!",1
"Of the women, the only one to succeed bringing real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. < br / > < br / > And it was well - deserved despite that Leonardo diCaprio came close and Liam Neeson wasn't even nominated. A beautiful performance, and one which should have been acknowledged. < br / > < br / > The low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time in detailing Ray's relationship with women.",1
"Foxx WAS Ray Charles. We had heard much of hype before seeing the movie, but this was uncanny. < br / > < br / > Now for the big question : what are the criteria for an Oscar? The line between actor and character was not blurred - but rather it disappeared completely.",1
This movie touched me. I can only dream. Jamie Fox was outstanding. I plucked down $ 18. May I comment on the acting for a second.,1
I will buy the DVD as soon as it is released. I took me to a new time and place. During the movie he was Ray.,1
Ray Charles is unique and amazing. This movie and soundtrack is a tour de force.,1
"Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White's script follow the well - worn biopic outline. That was Ray Charles. Hackford's stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and - - - better yet - - - more starring roles. The movie about his troubled life is good, not great. You can't have everything.",1
"< br / > < br / > I was wrong. Beyond that, although I like Ray Charles'music just fine, I don't consider myself a fan of him or his music. My wife wanted to see this movie and I grudgingly went along. I literally discovered myself involved in this movie during the course of viewing it.",1
But as I said lines before the evilness of Zo'or begin to take more importance so the new conflicts were less realistic as the same Talons.,1
"There are children struggling with this world wide. Jimmie Smit performs in one of his best roles ever. A very good film, focusing on a very important issue.",1
This is what only HBO is supposed to do.,1
All episodes of this show are great. This show was too good. An excellent cast too. Truly a one of a kind show. You get even belly - laughs... a lot. So much he's dripping in it.,1
"From the time I saw this, after the first episode finished, I made sure that I didn't miss that time slot next week. The situations were funny and serious, fast and sometimes slow, though not much it kept a good pace. I wondered what executive, made that decision to tear down a major comedy cornerstone for their network? Don't forget the lover on the side!! 00. It's just his Job! some years later, I finally found it on DVD new for $ 50. < br / > < br / > Then I felt anger and a feeling of being let down, that show just sailed off the air. HO, well now here is a show that the writing slugs you in the gut and while your doubled over, kicks you in the butt! There was so much room for expansion, it had barely just begun. If they had it would have run at least 3 - 5 seasons, maybe even six. Meaning, it'looks'very good!",1
"Since it remains quite obscure, that includes just about everybody. Margot ( or maybe Margaux ). Then anonymous notes threaten more deaths, which come to pass.",1
"On the day of their wedding, Leon returns and Nanette runs after him. Rating, 8.",1

"Then I'll continue... Hey, if you're thinking I'm indifferent about Bond flicks, you're wrong. 'Never'played a superb hand by treating 007 like he had been ageing since'Dr. Any spare moment, Bond and his antics would be on the TV. ). CHARACTERIZATION!!!!! * It's Connery's last film. If all you Bond purists out there think I'm gonna get controversial, you're right.",1
< br / > < br / > There is some resplendent acting in this movie. Barbara Carrera is impeccable as the bizarre Fatima Blush. It appears that the producers were trying to hurt the official Bond franchise. This seems to refer to the 12 year hiatus in Connery's portrayal of Bond.,1
"Besides, this is James Bond, remember?",1
"In addition, NSNA features a very talented young and beautiful Kim Basinger. < br / > < br / > I wouldn't trade any of the Moore pictures for this one.",1
"great theme song, though. And this movie is definitly worth seeing, no matter what anyone says. Sean Connery is the only Bond actor who is good at older age. So what? Sean Connery is the one and only 007.",1
"And tell me, how many really remember the music for Moonraker? Not surprisingly, his best moments are in the south of France, with his French love song ( at the health spa ) being particularly attractive. I personally would This cast is far superior, as well. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings his unique style to the role of Largo, without relying on an eyepatch, SPECTRE ring or a boring uniform. He is fit, energetic, and obviously enjoying himself.",1
"So rather than making Thunderball they ( fleming, broccoli, saltzman ) went on to make Dr NO. Barbara Carrera was excellent as fatima blush. Like most people out there who have watched James Bond 007 movies. This movie starred best Villian in a bond movie just behind dr no.",1
? Bond. And he does all these stunts at the ancient age of 56?? < br / > < br / > Highyly recommended.,1
Almost 99 % is same.,1
"< br / > < br / > Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her early film roles. < br / > < br / > Then there's the villain, Maximilian Largo played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Connery's delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was. 1983 was "" the battle of the Bonds "".",1
"Ironically, Roger Moore was a year older than Connery and Moore's Bond movies treated 007 as an active, young guy. Legrand replicates none of those snappy, jazz cues that made John Barry's music for the regular Bond franchise so memorable.",1
"Or was it working for less stingy producers? "" Then I shall cut out the white bread, sir, "" Bond smartly replies. Soft on action, it's nevertheless strong on character and clever dialogue. < br / > < br / > The 1980s were not a good decade for Bond, whether it was Connery, Moore, or Timothy Dalton.",1
"Many publicly vocalised their hope that Connery would return, if only to show Eon how a real Bond movie should look. B. C.'s Barry Norman how he viewed the prospect. The witty title was suggested by Connery's wife Micheline. In truth,'Octopussy'is superior in every respect. He had also written'The Parallax View ', one of the decade's finest conspiracy thrillers.",1
"4 points. As a Bond theme, it's merely okay. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film.",1
"Sean Connery still does a great job playing Bond, the acting from the other stars is also great. Check this out.",1
"The script is outstanding, as are the photography and the performances. I will watch this one frequently.",1
"I've always liked Sean Connery, but as James Bond I've always favored Roger Moore. < br / > < br / > Will Connery do James Bond again?",1
"He wasn't your normal Bond villain. I guess what disappointed me was the ending. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was the more intriguing of the two because he was so low - key and looked the "" nice guy next door. "" Just because Connery is in it, it doesn't mean it's automatically good.",1
I made you all wet.,1
"Both films are a big success in 1983, even if "" Octopussy "" earns more money at the box office. The star is Sean Connery, of course.",1
"It falls to Bond, of course, to save the world by tracking down the missing missiles. Never Say Never Again "", made by a rival producer, is, apart from the awful "" Casino Royale "", the only Bond movie which does not form part of that franchise. The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon ; two rival Bond films. "" ( A remake of "" Dr No "" or "" Goldfinger "" might have worked better ).",1
The acting is on a high level. Definitely worth seeing.,1
"Evil Ed is not just a cult movie - it's a classic! American splatter / gore - movies, they are not suppose to be creepy, only funny. It's not even creepy. That's OK. That's why this movie came as a relief. They are all about the same thing - blood and violence.",1
!,1
< br / > < br / > It is a morality play. Some of the actors overact.,1
"I was at my friend's house, and he had the VHS Evil Ed. The acting is great, the overdubbing is little funny ( Sam Campbell's voice is often found funny, same with the other actors ). < br / > < br / > quote from movie : "" Where in f * * k is my Beaver rape scene?! "" Imagine yourself in his place! I was thinking of The Ammityville Horror 2, but I got something way better. Very good, Nightmarish, bloody....... You just have to see it for yourself.",1

"< br / > < br / > The box at my video store is why I rented this one. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually watched it being an "" Evil Dead "" fan.",1
"Seriously, if you don't expect a lot then you won't be disappointed. Well that's what Evil Ed is, possibly the best awful film in the world. Possibly the greatest movie villain not named Tony Montana.",1
It has past almost 25 years since I saw this movie. Anthony Queen gives one of the most wonderful performances ever. In a matter of minutes he takes you from laugh to tears.,1
An Anthony Quinn triumph! He is missed.,1
Anthony Quinn is a master at capturing our heart and sympathy. But all our peasant wants to do is return home to his wife. The Nazis have different ideas.,1
"Again too bad it is not available for sale. The theme is very timely. I believe that if enough people request it, the movie will ultimately be put on DVD. I saw this movie years ago and I never forgot it.",1
Do you? I hate wars. I wonder why we humans still let wars happen.,1
I highly recommend people watch terrific little movie.,1
"According to IMDb it is actually shot in France and Yugoslavia, hmmm. The movie makes you really wonder if its filmed in Romania, which apparently is not the case. This is a finely crafted movie with moving sequences, humor, and best of all a love story.",1
Why not? For classic final scenes this movie is a stand out.,1
"The performance of Anthony Queen is absolutely great, and the rest of the cast does a great job supporting him.",1
The impression I got from this drama will be eternal. This movie... I was quite young when I first saw the movie.,1
"I stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping channels on the teevee late one night. < br / > < br / > This movie teaches a valuable lesson, and I recommend it especially to e. g. church groups or civil rights organizations. And although it tells a true story that takes place in WWII, it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening in Europe today.

"I won't go into Malachi, but I thought the way that played out was complete genius. This movie is a mystery.",1
But it really does have some fairly well thought out humorous moments. Films like this made today just don't have the same style.,1
"I thought it was funny. I agree that this film achieved its goals perfectly. I saw it on Showtime late at night as a teenager, and again in college. And there are boobs everywhere!",1
I think that the film has a female tone.,1
"So what does H. O. T. S really stand for? Therefore, the girls set out to discredit the society girls no matter what they have to do to get the job done. I loved this movie especially Lisa London.",1

Viva la nudity!,1
"Unlike most skin flicks, it did have a plot. 99 rack ( in case anyone wanted to get a copy )! Obviously this is not intended to win Oscars or break barriers in film. The movie was brilliant in its own way, in that it blended humor into a T & A movie loaded with Playboy Playmates! I notice that there are some people who would rate this movie low, and to me that is ignorant! The only difference is that the "" Nerds "" in this movie have a much better shot at getting laid!",1
"Lots of fully endowed t - shirts, vans, fighting, and a football game showdown like no other! I remember hearing about this movie and how it played at nearly every drive - in theatre here in Toronto.",1

Viva la nudity!,1
Except a plot and good actors. A jockstrap raid!!,1
This is an excellent T & A film.,1

That's not true. But that would mean for Nimi to give up all independence and self - determination. Especially when Sammy asks Matt about Sex. < br / > < br / > Nimi's situation is the absolute opposite. * Warning! You simply want to adopt him. It's just fantastic to watch them. < br / > < br / > Almost nothing to complain about.... wait!,1
I've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it. The Nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colourfully as it usually is.,1
"They were hilariously funny together and also touched my heart strings. just brilliant. Colins words and face at the end of that scene were so delightful and said it all! The two actors were just perfect together. It kept me fixed to the TV and guessing right until the end of the film. He played such a lovable and cheeky child character. Credit, of course, must also go to Fissy Roberts for his delightful portrayal of Sammy. < br / > < br / > The interaction between Colin ( Matthew Field ) and Fissy ( Sammy, Nimi's 7 year old Son ) was very special and so natural to watch.",1
"The dialogue is overly dramatic at times, and the < br / > < br / > transitions between scenes could be smoother. The English are a little too evil, the Scots are a bit too < br / > < br / > heroic.",1
They made the situation just as bad. Definitely worth seeing.,1
"Do you really think the French or the Brits were that much nicer in their colonies? It doesn't say that all the Belgians did was wrong and all the Congolese did was good. Being Belgian myself, I take interest in the history of Congo. I'm not saying that bad things didn't happen. No, they weren't.",1
I would just have liked better political analysis.,1
< br / > < br / > This film is real. It is eye - opening in its content.,1
"If this user indeed watched the film, the message was that he was not communist but pigeonholed ( by none other than Belgium, the U. S., the UN, etc. ) < br / > < br / > This is a MUST see for anyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics, and true freedom. You will not be disappointed. And this must have been quite some task. Depicting the struggles of the African freedom fighter, and ELECTED Prime Minister's struggles as its first leader, Mr. Peck, does a quite commendable job of putting together all of the pieces into one work. First of all, it is interesting to note that one of the users here who commented on this film ( from Belgium ) had to add that Lumumba was "" communist. "" < br / > < br / > And to to think that Oliver Stone's "" JFK "" took over 3 hours, "" Lumumba "" runs under 2 hours. as a "" communist "" leader for other individuals ', corporations ', and country's political and economic gains.",1
"And also what was going on with Tshombe and Katanga. < br / > < br / > In all it is a good movie to see. It is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality. Died a billionaire. Certainly Mobutu did, went on to loot the country for the next 35 yrs, before he was overthrown and fled the country. < br / > < br / > Some flaws : There was too little explanation how the man ( Lumumba ) got to rise in the first place.",1
"if you have the DVD version, there is also some useful historical background. however, a fair amount of worthwhile content gets lost in translation, and because names, acronyms, and so forth are hard to follow.",1
"And the Congolese? There were no good or bad there were just interests and conflicts of interest. When it comes to political movies I usually come out feeling empty. A must watch. They generally take up some moralistic stance and you have a clear good vs bad story line as if it is some sort of Batman movie. I don't think anyone is bad in this film, I just think they want too much from people sick of giving and want to start taking.",1
""", based on the book "" The Murder of Lumumba "" by Belgian historian Ludo de Witte. com web site fails to credit his service in the Belgian Congo. carlylegroup. Only Lumumba's murderers believe that.",1
"The film is brilliant made, moving along at a pace that is consistently engaging.",1
It deftly depicts the clutches that Belgium had on the Congo. See my notes on Quilombo. This movie is the best movie I have seen in a long time.,1
"There are rather scary hints of a troubled sexuality which are not explored in the movie. And all the characters fit in, too. And it's more than a rip - off. < br / > < br / > David Hemmings reprises the role he played in Antonioni's Blow Up.",1
I worked for eight ( 8 ) years in network news and Robin Stone's DO EXIST! It's not!,1

Nothing is worse than the genocides of our world's history. The most memorable parts are the graphic and saddening images that the people of Hiroshima face in the aftermath of war.,1
I saw the film yesterday and really enjoyed it. Also I want to mention about the performances of'breking dawn's stuffs. Maybe this was my carelessness. 'Let me go out'the key sentence of the film.,1
This was a excellent movie.,1
"Essential < br / > < br / > But then again, with "" Black Rain "" one can unmistakably sense Ozu's imprints. < br / > < br / > Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers. There is a sense of kinship, so to speak.",1
"This film is compelling viewing. While atomic warfare has not resurfaced since 1945, other deadly after - effects have. Family members become unrecognisable to each other, others resemble zombies as they wander the streets bedraggled and in shock.",1
"Acceptable sound. I have the DVD, and it's terrible.",1
"The story revolves around a young woman Yasuko, who was hit by black rain after the explosion. This black and white film, however sad and scary, is not without humor.",1
"Almost every single building is destroyed or damaged beyond repair. She forgot how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed. Everyone forgot it. They forget the hell of fire and go to rallies like an annual festival. Survivors must somehow restart their lives, unaware of the bomb's devastating after effects. Suddenly a blinding light flashes and a thunderous blast is heard.",1
"I repeat : a masterpiece. can be watched, even repeatedly, because of Imamura'compassion for his characters. Yet "" Black Rain "" ( "" NtMDm! """,1
"Genuine love, when it finally does appear, does so unexpectedly and ambiguously. Yasuko's potential suitors, naturally enough, shy away from a young woman, no matter how attractive, who might suddenly grow sick and die.",1
"If you don't HAVE to have car chases and explosions to be entertained, check this one out. Pretty darn good for a French film. But this one held my interest much more than I thought it would. She plays a very inexpressive actress for most of the film, whose talent is drawn out at end.",1
"I hope we see more him. What a great little film, highly recommended to all!",1
"WHO IS THISIRL?? ? However, there is a pretty young stage hand who walks thru a few scenes as an extra. 'That drama in itself becomes more exciting than the actual nudity and foreplay performed for the cameras. The actor is self absorbed and increasingly defies the direction of the Director, Jeanne. I think that is her in the far left edge of one of the pictures ( 2 of 9 ) here in IMDb. Not that Roxane Mesquida isn't lovely and worth seeing naked! This movie is a fascinating drama about the Making of a movie.",1
Smashing film about film - making.,1
I disagree that this is Breillat's first comedy.,1
"One can delight in the natural lighting which pervades the movie. This makes it realistic and believable. This is, however, doubly ironic, for the film we watch is in itself a construct within a construct. < br / > < br / > There'more to this film than just relationships, of course.",1
"Film genre? But, for what is a shape of incredible exorcism, for an actor, Breillat puts many questionings. Breillat observes the man in front of him even, a chaste man. So arranged, facing the problem of order of "" who I am "", the actors of Breillat put on an inorganic vitality to merge in her work in progress.",1
"Apparently Catherine Breillat specializes in hard - to - watch films, but I'd definitely say this one doesn't qualify. Highly recommended.",1
It made me think a lot about vulnerability and power. You don't have to agree with her take on everything to get a lot out of this.,1
The director is faced with a fusillade of obstacles as she tries to get the two individuals to perform beautifully on film.,1
"Catherine Brreillat is a French director who loves to provoke her audience. Jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director. Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant. She takes us along to witness how a film is done on location.",1
"But the film, like all of Breillat's work, is not entertainment alone.",1
"We'll be seeing a LOT MORE of her work, no doubt. Saw the film at the Hollywood Film Festival in Oct'04.",1
What a shame.,1
WTBS should be applauded for producing such an entertaining movie. My only complaint was that it wasn't long enough.,1
The actors did a great job. He reminds me of my boyfriend alot. so that's what Im gonna do.,1
with what they had.,1
"And, who is it sung by? It's a song that sounds very romantic and it is a female singer, piano playing, etc.",1
"i love their style. And that once joke where jack starts screaming prince, prince and all those dogs jump him. also the chapters suck.",1
"He gets the ax, and started chopping down on the beanstalk. And my favorite, the way Jack gets rid of the giant. A lot of fun, and fun for whole family as well. The goose who lays golden eggs. 5 stars!",1
"< br / > < br / > Watch it with your children and have a very fun evening! For us, an Abbott and Costello movie is something you have to be in the mood for.",1
"For other interpretations of classic story, "" Bewitched "" and "" Gilligan's Island "" both had episodes portraying it.",1
"Its funny when he doesn't make sense. Wow, Stella Shorts are great! I think over all that David was the funnies one.",1
"< br / > < br / > 7 / 10 This is decent, funny, and entertaining. Abbott and Costello at least made some pretty decent movies their later years.",1
( I don't know why they didn't that in other films. ),1
These things help make this film fun.,1
The greens look particularly bad. Most hues are orange or brown.,1
He played princess Shaye'father the king. Jack and the Beanstalk was that one film.,1
The slapstick in the house is good too. I think it's very funny and original. I loved it and I still do. Very good movie. He had a natural talent. Lou Costello is a very good at singing.,1
"There is a bunch of movies that we say must be seen twice. < br / > < br / > 9 / 10 However, for Mulholland Dr. this is different.",1
Mullholland Drive proves once again that David Lynch is the Master of cinematic expression. At the screening last night I witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. We realize that blockbusters are not the only path.,1
"He does this by presenting Diane's dream alter - ego, Betty, as a wholesome Canadian farm girl destined for fame. Is silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self - referential take on the film's status as fiction? < br / > < br / > The acting is top rate, especially Are Camilla and Diane really lovers or just friends? What does she signify? Lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and negates in equal measure.",1
"In all, it's very well scored. When that didn't happen, he pieced at the last minute this ending. Wow, what a strange film. I can't be done. < br / > < br / > At any rate, I find the film fascinating. So, if you're in that boat and was confused, don't feel bad ; that's normal.",1
Their brand of humor can't be restricted by censors or popular culture. They are equally as enjoyable as Stella itself. So I knew something didn't make sense. But I loved Wet Hot American Summer. It would have faired much better on HBO or Showtime.,1
"It is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds Lynch creates, the same complexity that characterizes the real world. This is not the case with Mulholland Drive, and has never been with Lynch. In doing this, he creates a framework of different layers in time and of the human mind. If anything, it brutally contrasts our ambitions and hopes to the often bitter truth. Nothing is what it first appears to be and you're left with a real puzzle as you end up trying to put the pieces together. Every frame of this movie has importance and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time. David Lynch's ninth full length feature film, Mulholland Drive is a deeply touching story about betrayal and jealousy. In some art, the beauty of it lies in its simpleness.",1
"< br / > < br / >'Mulholland Drive'is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch's cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his'Twin Peaks'TV series. ( Actually, it turns out Aunt Ruth As we later learn, Betty had herself arrived from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug contest. Spoiler Alert - although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explain.",1
It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly. Is it because it wants to destroy his toy?,1
"Watts is terrific. The music is excellent. It's like a dream captured on film. I love it. You see, Rita's lost her memory. And the directing - hah! For Lynch fans, this is a dream come true. She has no clue who she is.",1
"It is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together, so you must be patient and pay attention. Even when nothing happens, it is suspenseful. What an acting pair. Hitchcock would be proud of this movie. And yet, the plot is overshadowed by the theme, the mood, the character development, and the filming techniques. Get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts.",1
mulholland drive will haunt you. david lynch always draws such extreme reactions from his viewers. together they try to uncover the secrets behind the amnesiac's life. and that is when the film throws everything out the window. reminiscence about life's previous escapades?,1
"The film is constructed so that meaning will always be open to interpretation. Only the dark - haired woman survives. Lynch being of a particular disposition, these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself. < br / > < br / > But is the film worth It doesn't help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex.",1
"A masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head. ; ) < br / > < br / > First of all, Mulholland Drive is downright brilliant.",1
This is where Diane's fantasy starts. In her conscious state she is haunted by what she has done. Diane is then awakened.,1
"And the movie executes from beginning to end the same, understated style. < br / > < br / > Then it turns out that this is more similar to "" Joe Versus the Volcano "" in theme ( not style ). When it gets to the city, then it begins to feels like "" Kitchen Stories "", or "" Drifting Clouds "", even possibly "" Grimm "". Still beautifully done.",1
Sex toys included! Hilarious and low - budget comedy at it's best.,1
"Nevertheless, it made me think afterwards and now I actually think it'a good film - it surely does stick. Nobody can die in that place, but trying to certainly does hurt.",1
It certainly is original ; perhaps my problem is that the world that it satirises is not one that I recognise. Perhaps I should move to Scandanavia!,1
My interpretation of the'strange'ending would be that Andreas'journey ends in Hell. A very interesting addition to the Scandavian surrealistic collection. Recommended viewing for those who like their movies complicated.,1
The film is a great watch very thoughtful. A film without children also per Say makes for perfect ten.,1
"Scandinavians are pretty good at making me laugh at the drab nothingness of my soulless life, huh. < br / > < br / > I'll stop before I talk myself into taking a bus into wintry wilderness.",1
"Despite the fact that the concept itself isn't anything to write home about, everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world. The two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side, tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see. Driven to the edge by his lack of common senses, he feels nearly ready to kill himself.",1
Enjoyed'Den brysomme mannen'http : / / ow.,1
But Andreas is unfulfilled with their relationship as with everything else in this world. I think he is mostly poking fun at the dull Scandinavian society and its high suicide rates.,1
"After momentarily pondering his whereabouts, he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life. The film sketches out the dark realities of what has become of today's working man ( or woman ). The plot predictably evolves with Andreas wanting an escape. What is the meaning of life? He then enters a world different to the one he came from. ( well, close enough ). He doesn't know how he arrived there, but a welcome sign has been erected for him.",1
"A true auteur film I find it. true world is indeed a homo homini lupus, you'eaten if you are not strong enough.",1
"And you should follow their fine example, throw preconceptions to the wind, and prepare to laugh yourself sick. If you were ever a fan of MTV "" s "" The State, "" then these three guys will be familiar to you. < br / > < br / > Fantastic. No stone of decency is left unturned. But even if you only stumbled upon them via the internet like I did, you will soon come to appreciate their unique brand of comedy.",1
"Definite worth it! hell? What a great movie this was. The review I read on IMDb says this is hell, but I disagree whole - heartedly.",1
"And this movie is best when it devastatingly critiques this life style. But the next scene shows him arriving in a lonely bus into a desert. Is this a dream, or is he in paradise, or in hell?.",1
< br / > < br / > 9 / 10 ( and I don't rate easily! ) The STORY is breathtaking. The Bothersome Man is one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. But it doesn't end - he can not leave this strange world by suicide! < br / > < br / > Suffice it to say you will either love this movie or hate it. Well done! I feel that it is like a magical poem - open to many different interpretations and all of them as valid as the next.,1
Why is he the only passenger? Is the story even set in the real world? Is he a prisoner? But some pieces don't fit the puzzle.,1
"< br / > < br / > Den Brysomme Mannen deserves full attention by every human soul, because we could all use fresh Wake Up call.",1
"I'll jump right in and say it's in my opinion he's dead and has been sent to some sort of purgatory, as have all the city's inhabitants. Den Brysomme Mannen, or The Bothersome Man in English, is a surreal and deeply thought through film yet deeply entertaining and rich in content both on and under the surface. < br / > < br / > This was, in truth, a fantastic introduction to contemporary Norwegian cinema for me.",1
"Havard ( Johannes Joner ), his boss, tells him, "" You'll get used to it, "" which covers more than just crunching numbers, we suspect, in this world, same as the old world. Hell? Where the heck is Andreas ( Trond Fausa Aurvaag ), exactly?",1
This film craftily reveal our future to us.,1
At first sight The Bothersome Man seems like several other movies / books rolled into one.,1
"Like : a good job, a good home, a good wife, a good car, and even a good mistress. < br / > < br / > The symbolism behind the train - accident, I believe suggests that our own will can be overpowered by fate or some other universal greater power, even in the face of our so called power to decide when we want out.",1
"< br / > < br / > Not that it's ALL crude humor. It isn't. And I loved every minute of it. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Sam Rockwell all make appearances in various sketches.",1
See this movie!! ! I saw this movie yesterday and can't stop thinking about it.,1
Really one of the better movies i've seen this year.,1
Nope.,1
"The conclusion is necessary and we are left not sure if he'better off, which is the perfect conclusion. His quest is honorable, laudable, and precious. < br / > < br / > Breve!",1
"Trond Fausa Aurvaag is just the perfect guy to play the confused and bothersome Andreas. Another thing that contributes greatly to the is the performance from the actors. < br / > < br / > All in all, this is a fabulous movie. He has got a job, a house and clothes. But sure, everyone can see a film in their own way. At first, this city seems perfect, no death, no pain and no problems. ).",1
See it. What it is about? Don't know if I'm right. to be happy.,1
"Our "" hero "" though from the beginning seems to be misplaced and feels it himself. I strongly subscribe to that.",1
"THE BOTHERSOME MAN resonates ideas of Huxley and Kafka, but here the cruelty is the omnipresent noncommittal neatness. Everything is neat, pleasant - well, just nice. After being dropped off in the middle of nowhere, mid - thirties Andreas ( Trond Fausa Aurvaag ) starts a new job as a book - keeper in a small, clean city. 8 / 10 A true screen gem. It mostly reminds one of the ingenious FIGHT CLUB scene, in which Edward Norton walks through a mock - IKEA catalogue. Spiced with macabre humour, this Scandinavian laconic tale convinces on every level : story, characters, and relevance. In other words : you are in hell. He doesn't know where he came from anymore, but still remembers rich tastes, true feelings - anything beyond the non - committal flatline life he's leading now.",1
"< br / > < br / > go see it, its really worth it! Andreas arrives in a strange city. i gave it 9 out of 10.",1
Blurred is amazing. I must say THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. the soundtracks brilliant. The movie is 100 % brilliance.,1
"Deneu is very, very beautiful.",1
Remember that days of youth?,1
Grace - Good Thing 7. Lash - Take Me Away 3. Pollyanna - Rebound Girl 13. Track Listing : 1. James - Lick A Lounge 9.,1
A great idea for a movie.,1
Very nice teenager movie.,1
"The cast is full of stellar Aussie actors with enormous talent and loads of screen presence. Look out for Matthew Newton, cleverly cast as seedy limo driver.",1
Well! As for being the most erotic in the history of dance. It isn't even Debra Paget's most erotic dance.,1
I am 63 now and have never forgotten the movie. It was a wonderful movie. They have such charisma together. I have always wanted to see it again.,1
"This is one of my favorite films for many reasons. The film is an unusually colorful adventure, and we even see the princess rehearsing the dance she later performs ( for once ).",1
< br / > < br / > This movie is pure escapism.,1
"Pure, unadulterated, mindless hokum, lavishly produced ( low - budgeted, actually, but using sets and costumes left over from "" The Robe, "" this Technicolored spectacle looks like it cost millions ). Satisfaction guaranteed!",1
"So - it wanders a bit, but remains interesting. This must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time. We do like films to have a real sense of finality, and that is missing here. But Truffaut didn't snap, did he?",1
Gordon Harker is his very annoying partner. When I first saw it I was really disappointed. < br / > < br / > Now I see it as a good little drama. Sonnie Hale who was married to Jessie Matthews at the time played bus conductor.,1
"So many episodic type films are disjointed and untidy, but this is not one of them.",1
This is an exceptional film. The dialog is exquisite.,1
< br / > < br / > It starts off with the scene of a bus crash in London.,1
"There is an horrific crash and one passenger dies. Great stuff, a little like a good tabloid news story fleshed out in precise, even handed detail. This film has an excellent premise and is really crying out to be turned into a Hollywood blockbuster.",1
"But, the movie holds your interest as it keeps you guessing. < br / > < br / > And, an excellent story it was.",1
"It's pretty OLD dear, "" I recall my mom telling me! This was July 1955... and then probably only the third house in the street to HAVE television! A tinkerer with all things electrical, dad had it working inside two days.",1
I am now a fan of the Full Moon Subspecies series. The story is chilling and I think this was a fun vampire movie.,1
"For a transylvanian, it is quite... believable. A realistic vampire. Gothic, beautiful. Something similar is Nosferatu In Venice with Klaus Kinski. A wonderful story. We have here the perfect vampire movie.",1
She was not so convincingly in her role as a prostitute then lover / wife of Louis Mahé ( Belmondo ).,1
Our children are dying. It is all preventable.,1
"This is Horror 101 all the way. And the score - - the music - - really stood out for me as a nice change of pace, very mood - setting. I can't. ( Of course, some bad films get sequels, too - - did I mention "" Puppet Master ""? ) Heck, you even get two sequels, which is the sign of a true horror film.",1
< br / > < br / > the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever.,1
if no one has seen the movies. these are the best of the best.,1
"However, for some reason or another that scenario never made it on camera. I ordered a copy back in 1993 from Full Moon and I learned this : Ion and Rosa, the servants, have much bigger roles in the screenplay along with the King.",1
I must admit I half expected it to be a B - Movie disaster but I was pleasantly wrong. < br / > < br / > Subspecies is about a family of Vampires.,1
"The script has moments of intelligence, especially when it delves into local folklore ( all bogus, I'm sure ). < br / > < br / > But I linger too much on movie's flaws. Unfortunately, "" Subspecies "" is not particularly laughable, and not that bloody, so it gets a low rating. A totally sincere Radu is somewhat silly. Subspecies, "" like many other horror films, gets a raw deal on IMDb. The non - actors are flat, the subspecies are a poor special effect, and the nighttime scenes are too brightly lit. "" That's too bad. For what it is - straight - to - video vampire horror - "" Subspecies "" is perfectly fine. Somehow, the location filming and smartish script work well together - "" Subspecies "" has its own very distinctive world. But what do you expect? To risk damning with faint praise... it could be a lot dumber.",1
"Original Plot and good, easy to follow Story.",1
He's what a vampire should be. But maybe I'm just a sicko.,1
He marries to Julia but she suddenly disappears. The USA version was cut numerous minutes and deserves an urgent restoring and remastering. This is one of the best of his suspense movies along with ¨Farenheit 451 and Shoot the piano player¨.,1
"The character are great, even the locations and the story. I love this movie really.",1
So why do I glorify these movies??? Sure it does... Radu Himself is the source of the atmosphere...,1
"It is wonderful to look at the sites, the cars ( DS! ) and Orly. A sparkling movie.",1
"This film will make you feel better. Set in France's government circles in the late 1950's, it entertains from beginning to end. Brigitte serves the plot very well by using her talent for acting in light comedies.",1
"Michel is surprised by his jealousy. < br / > < br / > It's an admittedly light piece but it's incredibly charming. Worthy of a rental. Bridgette Bardot, looking as sexy as ever, plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of a French Ambassador.",1
"In a closeup at the end of this movie she winks and flirts with the camera, her beautiful orbs twinkling. There are several good performances here. She deserved them and was able to demonstrate her full cinematic power when they came her way. What a babe! A still photo simply could not do her justice.",1
"'< br / > < br / > Dear, dear Bardot!",1
). < br / > < br / > A top 5 romantic comedy of all time. What a stroke of luck.,1
"10 / 10 I will not spoil it with saying what, though it is divulged fairly early on. A definite must see for any cineaste or moviefan. Deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly.",1
The script asks us to believe that us men are such one - dimensional turds that it'truly beyond belief. After she attempts suicide Matthau decides to get responsible and marry the girl.,1
"There is nice supporting work from Rick Lenz as Toni's bohemian neighbor Igor and Jack Weston as Julian's smarmy actor buddy Harvey. I particularly like how casual she appears after her overnight romp. She and Matthau have great, unforced chemistry in their scenes together. Billy Wilder's longtime collaborator, I.",1
And Walter Matthau is great as Julian. What an absolutely charming movie. There wasn't an unlikable character in the bunch. Goldie Hawn is also delightful to watch.,1
"He plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest. The movie was funny, entertaining, and didn't sell out by being preachy. This role is one of the exceptions.",1
Not to mention the entire thing seemed rather ridiculous.,1
So at the start of the film Toni tries to commit suicide by the gas of her stove. But as Toni Simmons it is quite different. ).,1
"Theirs is an accidental love affair in the making. Rick Lenz gives ample support as Hawn's newly - found boyfriend as well. < br / > < br / > The film, however, is another tribute to Ingrid Bergman.",1
"And she's a joy to behold. OK, so she's a nun with TB who's probably in love with Fr.",1
I am surprised by the relatively low rating this film has. Not sure why it's average is so low as I give it a solid.,1
"First : a joint bank account. Louis finds himself unable to kill her. They flee to Paris, where Louis discovers that Marion has a costly taste. She tells her story : Orphan. And then, when Julie's sister draws attention to herself, the flight.",1
"Director Saks and writer I. The film is likable fun, and Hawn and Bergman make you care.",1
She seemed very lifeless and completely schooled by the 54 (! ) year old Bergman in the scenes where they are side by side.,1
"Yes, the dialogue and the settings are slightly dated, but the story is timeless and the performances by stars make it imminently watchable. Bergman is luminous in this film, looking absolutely beautiful ( though the camera has always loved her ) and showing an unforeseen knack for light comedy.",1
"I never liked it when I first saw it on her and I still don't. < br / > < br / > Goldie won an Oscar for her role. It doesn't suit her at all, which is too bad. ( I'd be more specific, but don't want to spoil it for anyone. )",1
"At any rate, she's a surprising choice to play the nurse who puts on a freeze act at the office but is considerably warmer off duty. < br / > < br / > Ingrid is surprisingly fetching in a rare comedy role, although there are times when seems just a bit too matronly for the part. Easy to see why she won that Supporting Actress Oscar. < br / > < br / > As Goldie's next door neighbor, Igor, Rick Lenz acquits himself admirably, and makes a suitable match for her in that final scene. < br / > < br / > It's the kind of rib - tickling comedy that'll have you laughing out loud at some of the amusing lines that Abe Burrows and I. A. L. Diamond have managed to scrap together, based on a French farce.",1
"Thankfully, she made out ( no pu intended ) much better. The scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching.",1
I discovered this late one night on Turner Classics. but her acting is extraordinary.,1
"A. L. Diamond's script gives him plenty. < br / > < br / > For me, the film's score, written and adapted by legendary Quincy Jones is another highlight. While the general plot stretches credibility, Bergman's performance is compelling : honest and utterly believable. No one could deliver a zinger like Weston, and I. by heart only enhances the enjoyment. For example : "" That's such a big, dirty, rotten lie it has class. "" On Broadway Matthau's role was played by Barry Nelson. Knowing all the lines ( and what lines! )",1
"* * * from * * * * Hawn ( who won a Supporting Oscar ) is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today. Cactus Flower "" is a lovely sigh!",1
My vote is eight. But Comolli is chasing Marion in France accused of murdering Julie. They get married and Louis shares his bank accounts with her. Catherine Deneuve makes this film worth and gives credibility to the passion and lust of Louis.,1
"When she's on the screen, it positively twinkles. A. L. Diamond's adaptation, and Ingrid Bergman's flawless performance. And who wouldn't want to hang out at a nightclub called The Slipped Disc? Its witty screenplay adaptation should have netted Oscar nominations for the great screenwriter I. In fact, I am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirty - five years. Hawn's fashions are as tacky as Bergman's are chic. ( He resembles Griffin Dunne in this film. ) But then again, would we have Ingrid any other way? ) It is more linked to the era films that came before it than ones that followed.",1
"Its very title suggests a "" sunny "" romantic comedy with occasional lapses into the risqué. CACTUS FLOWER is no exception. He can'r marry her : he's already married.",1
"In a phrase, moral ambiguity. In the American one, they win our hearts. Both are excellent, but the BBC towers over the remake.",1
If you loved Traffic then Traffik is a must see.,1
"< br / > < br / > Well written, well made, beautifully acted and superbly filmed.",1
"I was not impressed with the Germans throughout. Why? ( And yes, I understand... her children. A fantastic adaptation. Certainly, this improved as the mini - series progressed. I also feel the police in the film far outclassed the mini - series. < br / > < br / > Finally, the dialogue, as delivered in the film, is much more nuanced. Especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim. """,1
"< br / > < br / > This puts Hollywood epics like "" The French Connection "" in their place! I highly recommend it!",1
"It's much longer, but gripping and totally well done.",1
"He rings the doorbell and Deneuve answers wearing a negligee. She is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch. I see nothing'Hitchcockian'about the film at all. < br / > < br / > I disagree with previous posters. < br / > < br / > As well as directing, Truffaut also wrote the screenplay.",1
"< br / > < br / > Drugs are worse than war. The original TRAFFIK completely stole me away from anything else that was on. My God, I never knew how bad problem really was over in Europe... even all over! < br / > < br / > The truly incredible portions of the movie all come from Pakistan. Each show one very clear and undeniable fact. They work in the shadows, the dark secrets of any "" successful "" society. What an awesome mini - series.",1
"The characters are fleshed out better so that their actions are more believable. Thank god Traffik was not that hokey and far - fetched. < br / > < br / > Boy, was my preconceptions wrong about this TV series. It is so much more involving than Traffic.",1
"The best thing one can say about the film "" Traffic "" is that it brought attention to the superior British mini - series "" Traffik "". The hardships of the family are similar to that of the rickshaw pullers family in "" City of Joy "". Eventually the farmer finds work, but he compromises his pride and honesty. Other than that, this was a fine piece of work of the kind we see all too rarely. < br / > < br / > Possiblepoiler ahead.",1
I remember seeing this in the early 90's on UK TV and was hooked.,1
"The scenes in this show will remain with you for a long, long time. - - Colin Glassey All three stories are told realistically and with empathy. Traffik is a really well done 6 hour drama about drugs ( circa 1987 ). Highly recommended.",1
You won't regret it.,1
"It is stark, uncompising and brutal.",1
This is one of the best films I've seen in the last years.,1
If you've not seen this then look out for it. It is available on DVD. Seeking justice for his murdered partner. The pointless attempts at subsidy resulting in the system getting rich. Several interleaved stories are connected through the drugs trade. This really is a masterpiece.,1
"In a carefully contruct storyline, one gets the impression on how everything is inter - related.",1
"It is devastating - - bleak and brutal but never apathetic. In short, Traffik is a rare work of film that handles challenging subjects with unmatched compassion clarity. First, it must be said that Traffik contains some of the most incomparably and unforgettably haunting scenes I have seen in a film or television production.",1
"< br / > < br / > Facts, normally reassuring markers on a map, are clearly not enough - the more facts we get, the less controllable the situation seems. < br / > < br / > Like I say,'Traffik'isn't really about drugs. But these'facts'come from a variety of sources - dissembling government representatives ; left - wing lawyers with vested ( ideological and domestic ) interest in corruption ; poor farmers who need to grow poppies to survive. Just as the anti - heroes of the old Warners'gangster films were actually model American capitalists, so the traffikers are the ideal being espoused by Thatcher and Reagan ) that at least the reality of the problem can be acknowledges. '",1
Don't miss it. Great movie with uninterrupted action. Hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police. One can see him wanting Gary Cooper as an icon in the Frank Capra mold. This leads to a cross - country chase scene reminiscent of other Hitchcock heroes on the run.,1
Also really good. And Frank Fry is a member of that group. His best friend is killed.,1
"Then the rich rancher and his nest of plotters. He takes part as a gravel in the organization in the sabotage of a USS Alaska military ship when it is launched. But Hitchcock has to make it a real thriller. The chase after the real saboteur takes our young false suspect from Los Angeles to New York and to the top of the organization. That one won't fry on the old electric sparking chair. And he discovers target in a Soda City, an electric dam that provides Los Angeles and its war industry with the energy they need. It is war propaganda.",1
"This not best film Hitch made, but it is surly one of his most entertaining. The two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very good and the beginning fire at the Aircraft Factory is a superb sequence. The two leads, admittedly, are quite weak.",1
You will like it. I love this movie. It is the first film Master P have ever done.,1
"The best part is the final sequence, which perfectly mirrors what Hitchcock would use later in North by Northwest, only this time climax is atop a statue in New York. < br / > < br / > In terms of sheer originality and quality, this does lack in some areas, particularly the motive of the antagonists. Certainly not his best, but the Master of Suspense gives us some great moments to wait for.",1
"I can recommend it, just not enthusiastically. The sound design is almost non existent. The climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. Then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside. With Saboteur Hitchcock was more room to roam free, whereas Rope took place all in one room. The relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. Everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page.",1
This fact gets lost in film history.,1
"8 / 10 Bethany Cox Overall, not Hitchcock's best, but definitely worth look.",1
"Don't try to make sense of it. Kruger's acting and dialog was especially good. Lane's character here was a little lame. Overall, this is entertaining and odd film.",1
! I really loved seeing this movie.,1
"See it and Go Bless America! He escapes, meets a kindly blind gentleman and his niece, enter Priscilla Lane. They trail ends up in the mansion of a unlikely New York Socialite. This movie is a masterpiece of brilliant acting and timely patriotic sense of pride in America. See this movie if you don't see another Hitchcock film.",1
"Hitch's trademark touches of humor are here, too. Patricia is a billboard model who's various roadside ads are a help and comfort to Barry as he hitches a ride with bad guys, all the way from Las Vegas to NYC. We certainly do in this fine film. ! That way, the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero. Barry even returns a lost $ 100 bill to Fry later on... that was BIG money in 1943! Awful for the dead old man, but funny!",1
We also see his hearing ability through those scenes. And Hitchcock didn't get a Best Director Oscar for Rebecca. So role went to Robert Cummings. But he was unavailable. I thought he did his best. That is my favorite scene. But Gary Cooper wasn't interested in doing a thriller. He enjoyed working with Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent ( 1940 ).,1
"Many people criticise the older films for their lack of realistic special effects. Well worth checking out, especially for the support roles.",1
< br / > < br / > If you are a fan of No Limit back then or even now check it out. This movie was marketed extremely well.,1
"Priscilla Lane does a fine job with a difficult role. Ah, Hitchcock! Was I wrong! I was of course familiar with the Statue of Liberty climax from having seen it repeatedly in film retrospectives but I wrongly assumed the story leading up to it might not hold my interest.",1
* * * from * * * *,1
I really enjoy this film.,1
It shouldn't work but it does. < br / > < br / > There are a lot of things wrong with this film.,1
"It happens quickly so don't blink. In "" North by Northwest, "" of course, it's Mt. Rushmore. Look for Hitchcock's mini - western in this one.",1
"Where Saboteur differs from his better known films is that the audience is let in on the game early. Cummings is very youthful here, and quite engaging. Was the director perhaps studying key American films of the previous decade? The villains become apparent fairly soon ; and the movie hinges more on its plot than its ironies. < br / > < br / > As is the norm in Hitchcock's films, nothing is as it appears.",1
"These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good, law abiding citizens. Of course in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry, falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix. ! It's a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited, culminates in one of Hitchcock ' NO SPOILERS!",1
But you get a 1000 watt shock when you finally come to know the villain. Or the wonderful dance by Vyjantimala in Hotho Pe Aisi Baat. Or the romantic Dil Pukare Are Are in the beautiful Sikkim. < br / > < br / > This film was also talked about for its song's videos.,1
"As mentioned elsewhere, though, Otto Kruger steals the show as the villain. It really is his signature theme. And so, just like "" The Man Who Knew Too Much "", I believe this is an American remake of one of Hitchcock's earlier works.",1
"Albeit, its in a club, its in Wales and its somewhat dated. < br / > < br / > Seriously now. It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.",1
This film is too good for words. !,1
This movie explains everything that is currently going on in the world.,1
"I knew you wouldn't let me down, I knew it!!! """,1
"The film is layered in depth and the dialogue in places is just spot on, especially with Jip.",1
An excellent thriller of all time.,1
It has been years since I have been privileged to see this movie on TV. Thank you so very much. I only wish I could contact someone to see it again.,1
Tremend fun.,1
"The story to the film is not all that, but that is not a criticism. Fantastic Movie! This is a film about people.",1
for them its their holiday. Another situation they all have to face. No other movie can do this. This movie came out a couple of years after i started going clubbing. it really taps the whole situation. We all had our own stuff going on.,1
"Amar we are told has 6 digits on one of his foot. That is what most of the mystery is about. < br But our sauvé Vinay ( Dev Anand ) is anything but Bond. Helen, Tanuja, and the mysterious Vyajanthimala ( and some cameos. )",1
I strongly suggest seeing this movie. This is not how the movie came off to me at all.,1
"The week is hell for them and they only wait for one thing : the week - end. There's Jip who works in a clothes shop. A bunch of 5 mates are deeply bored in this town. It means : how to have fun as much as possible while knowing that you have a shortened lapse of time. A perfect symbiosis between the sound and the music. Nina, inseparable from her best friend Lulu and Moff. Cardiff, Wales. Kerrigan's relentless directorial style expresses very well the spirit of debauchery and care freeness of the 5 protagonists. The amount?",1
Everything about it. I absolutely love this film.,1
Here are some extra lines to make the IMD gods happy.,1
There's loads of comedy here - Howard Marks'' spliff politics'speech is hilarious! < br / > < br / > 8 / 10 < br / > < br / > Enjoy! and so do I... sometimes. At least the film doesn't shy away from this fact.,1
and the comedown - sunup scenes. This film was hilarious.,1
"Director Cirio H. Santiago, working from a blithely trashy script co - written by none other than Dick Miller (! ).",1
"Pam Grier she ain't. If you don't take it all too seriously, the movie is great fun to watch.",1
"If you want romance, tragedy, and humor, this movie's got it.",1
"< br / > < br / > The actors are extremely well chosen - Michael Sheen not only "" has got all the polari "" but he has all the voices down pat too! A wonderful little production.",1
"This is one of best thrillers ever made in India. Just like Hitchcock's movies, Jewel Thief can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of Sikkim. etc. The tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes Vijay Anand as a great director himself.",1
Michael Sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant portrayal of a comic genius. If you are familiar with Kenneth Williams'mannerisms and Diaries then this drama captures the essence of them perfectly. I have seen it a dozen times and still cry uncontrollably at the point where he bids goodnight to LOUIE. Pauly. I cannot recommend this drama enough.,1
"Recommended, but it'tragi - comic, indeed. ).",1
I watched fantabulosa!,1
Infamy! still makes me laugh.,1
"The cast acted superbly, but Michael She was outstanding.",1
"Watching this PPV, I had high expectations for it, since Smackdown is the best show in WWE, this is a very good PPV as it is the last one before Wrestlemania. Benoit rolls through & makes Joey Mercury tap out to get a victory for the Hardy Boys & himself. Finlay nails Little Boogeyman with the Shillaegh to get the win. Boogeyman does not deserve to be on a PPV, & does not deserve to be in WWE.",1
Wait. If I wanted suspense and tension I'd watch a real Narrative sci - fi movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > But the rest of the science was excellent. As it was, I was left hungry. But zero for noisy spaceships.",1
"Ever watched clips from REAL space missions and REAL space probes? 5 actors do a good job. None i'll tell my grandchildren about, but very fair for it being BBC docu - simulation. Yet the chest x - ray is real, while the cyborg flick is just fictionalized SFX.",1
"Many many good looking women ( Anju Mahendru, Faryal ) are after the hero. that the thief is Amar the doppelganger. The police force, including Vinay'Dad, are completely befuddled. Tanuja is cute as a button and I loved her in this film.",1
"Which is why I was so strongly rooting for it to succeed as an honest - to - goodness sci - fi film. Then I got the DVD ; it did not disappoint! What compelled me to write this now ( 2 yrs. later ) was that I'd just seen SUNSHINE last night. Sometimes it takes a not - so - good film to compel one to re - watch a better film. As an armchair astronaut, I'd trade my passage on Icarus for a seat on Pegasus any day. ).",1
"I doubt it. Would it survive being hit by comet debris? Also, the ship seemed overly sturdy.",1
"More than likely, visits to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc. < br / > < br / > The special effects are excellent for a TV show. would / will be separate missions. I came across this movie on DVD purely by chance through a Blockbuster rental. I found the actors believable as astronauts.",1
"Joe Aherne, the screenwriter and director, is the most amazing man to work for. I'm really lucky to have been part of this show. and my god it'a beautiful universe out there.",1
"His commitment and professionalism were second to none. Back in 1980 in post labour England, this film was bloody funny.",1
"This, in itself, didn't necessarily mean that the script would fail. Recommended viewing. Criminally, he wasn't even nominated. There are, however, some examples which manage to pull it off, just. In this respect the film pales in comparison to Rising Damp's brilliant series.",1
"Nowadays, we just flip the switch and put our minds on "" pause. "" Its plot keeps one guessing, its ending is uncompromising, and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia.",1
"The audiences couldn't handle another'bad'alien, they wanted ET. < br / > < br / > A paranoid masterpiece. Their loss in the long run. The performances are all fine, and the ending is terrific - still unique today.",1
This film had feeling. Special effects that are a lot more impressive than the computer generated images that we get to see today. Emotion. It couldn't.,1
"punchline Bladerunner. and the effects ( more yucky than Alien ). < br / > < br / > Finally, the epilogue scene really, really cuts. Enough said.",1
"9 out of 10. Plus remixed in Dolby Digital for even scarier sound effects. The Thing "" is John Carpenter's best movie.",1
Forget the exorcist and all the other hype horror movies out there. ! This is one of the most outstanding horror movies i've ever seen in my life time. Long live John Carpenter!,1
"< br / > < br / > This is one of the best films of all time. ( Unless, "" The Thing "" was actually feminine! Heck, being a feminist, I didn't even MISS women in this film! I cannot believe I never added my two cents about this film as yet! The audience at the screening went wild! Brilliant. in that film.",1
"Strong recommended, 9 / 10.",1
The matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless. Aaah...,1
"John Carpenter's "" The Thing "" is one of very few films to fit this criterion. ).",1
"But all of this would make Carpenter's film It isn't long before everybody in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man. These effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also be quite stomach - turning.",1
It is simply brilliant. Get some Budweiser from the fridge. A brilliant horror film.,1
This movie is visually great. The swordfighting is great.,1
"< br / > < br / > Ennio Morricone's score works all the way. It'minimalistic and depressing sound perfectly fits the movie's overall tone. It seems that at the time people were overwhelmed by the idea of the "" good "" alien. There are no "" whats behind you? "" jumping moments here. Not knowing who might or might not be the creature, we see how every character reacts to the situation. An idea spawned after the success of "" I. T. "".",1
Absolutely essential viewing.,1
"< br / > < br / > 9 / 10 John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of Sci - Fi and horror, adopting the classic body - swap theme and taking it to the extreme.",1
"( previously adapted as "" The Thing From Another World "" ) is closer to the original tale and keeps a pessimistic feeling of dread and high doses of suspense in a masterfully crafted study about paranoia. After the Norwegians are killed accidentally, the Americans try to figure out what made them to be insane. < br / > < br / > Director John Carpenter earned a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher "" Halloween "", where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock. """,1
The Thing is a milestone in movie - making and remains one of my favourite films of all - time.,1
"As it should. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing. And that's even rarer! The two are diametrically opposed. Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake.",1
"It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of Wilford Brimley and Keith David.",1
It actually STILL scares me. < br / > < br / > Still the scariest of them all.,1
You just know that something is not right! Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score that sets the tempo! The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies.,1
Carpenter manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.,1
I loved end.,1
It's now considered one of John Carpenter's best. NOT a date film! That'annoying... but the movie still works. That movie was scary. A must - see... for strong stomaches.,1
"Let it absorbe you, and you'll see it my way! My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing! < br / > < br / > Best View Time : Late February between 5 and 9 in evening. Be sure you're not interupted by anyone.",1
"This movie is to be considered a classic. Nobody I've asked have heard of it. Helpless and alone out in no - mans land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. < br / > < br / > The acting is great! Well, think again! Antarctica, winter 1982. It really gets you in the right mood. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say nothing less.",1
John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. It's hard to put my finger on it. What makes the movie so great?,1
"The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. The groupplinters and fear rules supreme. Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. This film has something for any lover of the The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. < br / > < br / > The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. Who is the Thing?",1
"< br / > < br / > The film is terrific on many levels. I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this film was only about a year ago.",1
"This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. How many Things are there? How can the Thing be killed? I know I'm human. And then it's won. """,1
A little bit insane and a lot funny.,1
< br / > < br / > DeVito is very funny but also a little sad.,1
"He uses just the right touch of comic darkness to create a world of corruption and sickness. He gets an idea. "" Throw Momma from the train! < br / > < br / > Danny DeVito directed this film excellently. Crystal's ex - wife is a * hag * to put it nicely, and Crystal hates her.",1
I really felt for both characters and sensed a strong bond. I only hope more people can see this movie to give it fair voting. < br / > < br / > While Sword In The Moon isn't perfect ( what movie is? ) it still is wonderful and moving.,1
"WITHOUT a big hunk of cheese tied on the end. Danny DeVito played a gem, quite a feat considering he was directing as well. < br / > < br / > Brilliant script, brilliant idea, perfect cast, great film. There is no one that can play this part so well. < br / > < br / > And what's more? I don't understand this movies distinctly average rating!?",1
"It almost became a joke... "" I know, let's watch Throw Momma from the Train ""... I don't know why it was always turned down, it just was. But there it sat for nearly ten years. I think that's all I can say. This movie sat in a dusty stack of videos in my house for ages before we watched it.",1
"The movie is rather off the wall, but there are some unforgettable lines. I thought that the interplay between Crystal and DeVito was great.",1
"And just like in the movie, Larry thinks that it's a joke, but Owen's serious. A modern classic. There isn't dull moment in it. And that ending was a hoot.",1
"Very, very good! Also starring Rob Reiner as Joel and Oprah Winfrey. You don't see the meaning of the title till much later, but you get the point of it in the first few minutes. Basically, Owen wants to be a good writer, like his teacher Larry Donner ( Billy Crystal ), and he inspired by murder stories.",1
I give it my full recommendation.,1
See it for yourself ( no spoilers here! : - ).,1
I gave it a 10. Danny De Vito plays Owen perfectly. It turns out that Owen wrote a children's pop - up book.,1
"Some of the scenes seemed to not fit in for me, but this didn't make it a bad movie.",1
"I saw the movie on its North American premiere ( July 14, 2004 ) at the Fantasia Festival. Still, the movie was solid, thoughtful and visually intriguing. How does one decide?",1
"Please, sit back and enjoy this movie, people! It's a good one! Together they made a great duo of insanity and obsession.",1
"She says things like "" You have no friends! "" A picture starring Danny Devito and Billy Crystal. She puts down Danny also by calling him "" Lard ass! "" "".",1
"Danny Devito directed the film and did a good job getting the dark tone in to his direction. He has a child like role that makes him seem more of a confused man than a killer. Lift. PG - 13 for Language, Sexuality Violence. For any fan of comedies I recommend this. stars : Danny Devito, Billy Crystal, Anne Ramsey, Kim Griest, Kate Mulgrew, Oprah Winfrey and Rob Reiner.",1
and El Cabongs Larry with the frying pan. Lift! That woman is your mother. What does he do? Push her overboard.,1
"< br / > < br / > Owen is stuck in his own life, with a demanding evil mother ( Anne Ramsey ) who he can't stand. Janeway from Star Trek : Voyager ). He has toy train tracks, need I say more? Hilarity ensues while the two try to deal with each other's problem. When I watched this movie when I was a kid I didn't understand the premise of Hitchcock movies, and dark comedy. Think of Failure to Launch, only Matt McConaughey is short, fat, and bald.",1
"< br / > < br / > For devotees of black comedy, this one is guaranteed to please.",1
Don't be fooled by the murder plot.,1
"The resulting action is often quite funny, and even poignant. She is loud, ugly, rude, and overbearing. Black comedy isn't always an easy sell. < br / > < br / > The acting is exceptional, even if Ramsey was a bit over the top. People seem to either set their minds for comedy, or for serious mayhem. It's certainly never dull and often full of surprises.",1
"Throw Momma From A Train is one of the best black comedies out there, should not be missed. That woman might need killing, but she's going to take a lot of it. But Crystal's having a bit of a problem putting Ramsey down even with Danny's help.",1
"The production values are high, with some good cinematography to capture it. This doesn't take particularly long, but the answer is not one he wanted to hear. The story can be a little difficult to follow at first, but all makes sense eventually.",1
"However, one student ( Danny DeVito ) is extra strange. 8 / 10 stars.",1
"My vote is seven. Further, Larry suggests Owen to watch Hitchcock's movies to understand the structure of a suspenseful story. Kim Greist is very beautiful and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect bitch.",1
"I especially loved Larry's confession to the sleeping Mrs. Owen is in Larry's class. I saw the movie. Ramsey is repulsively funny - a totally "" out there "" performance.",1
"< br / > < br / > Then there's DeVito's Owen Lift, who calls himself Professor Donner's "" star pupil "" even though the teacher won't read his work in class. That's one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of people. < br / > < br / > "" Throw Momma From The Train "" is a terrific comedy, even if it isn't a great film.",1
Bless em. I've already seen it several times and laughed my socks off at it.,1
"The plot is easy to follow! In process, the boy meets the Viking Chief's daughter Abba and they fall in love, etc etc etc...",1
Enjoy Gaul adventure!,1
"I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite the fact that it wasn't true to the comic. Asterix and Obelix are sent by Vitalstatistix to go rescue Justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son back home. < br / > < br / > The plot is this - the Viking chief, Timandahaf, is sick and tired of going to raid villages and then finding them emptied.",1
"3D computer images are incorporated seamlessly with the traditionally animated 2D art. < br / > < br / > If there is anything to criticize about the story, it is the lack of "" asterix "". Highly comedic, well written jokes pepper the upbeat script.",1
As a family film it works better than other Asterix titles I've seen.,1
"This feature film shows all the original elements and humor of comics in a delicious and wonderful animation. My vote is ten. In the end, Asterix realizes that it is not fear that gives wings, it is love.",1
"Its got some very funny jokes in it and the animation is superb. We have a misunderstood boy who doesn't fit in, Justforkix.",1
wow! go to see it! the best animated Astérix movie ever!,1
They don't fit the characters at all. < br / > < br / > I saw'Astérix et les Vikings'at a public screening during the World Cup. A lot.,1
I'll be showing it to my French students. A wonderful tale spun expertly.,1
"On the contrary. When they tried to modernize last film ( twelve years ago ), they completely blew it.",1
You there!,1
"< br / > < br / > Well done, sir! Easily one of the best shows ever made, & it just gets better with age.",1
"He has many of the witties lines. Pigsy is just plain gross. "" Who are you? """,1
He's clearly a man having a mid - life crisis and drink drives but....... Jason King is brilliant.,1

"What a square. Cool, right? The gang members comply.",1
"But you can tell the filmmakers had their heart in the right place, and damn if the thing doesn't work! See it. I only pray it'll be on DVD soon. He also manages to anger a coke - snorting drug kingpin who vows to destroy him.",1
And there are many very amusing moments.,1
And a hard spot somewhere else. thank you very much. I kid you not.,1
"In upper Bavaria, Germany. Because I watched it. You've never seen a film like that.",1
Many people become upset when later in life it doesn't live up to their previous memories. If you're looking for a comedic masterpiece this isn't it. Yes the women don't conform to the modern ideal of attractiveness. < br / > < br / > If you compare 2069 to a modern soft - core erotic comedy you may be disappointed. < br / > < br / > I see many people complain about the quality please understand it was made in 1974. If you are looking for an erotic masterpiece this isn't it. If you're looking for something hardcore this isn't it.,1
It certainly got my juices flowing.,1
This truly is an Australia cult classic. I have a copy on DVD from the UK.,1
"It shared many of the same writers and directors! His theme for'Department S'has got to rank as one of the best television themes of all time. King caught the public's fancy and was later awarded a spin - off show. As was case with so many I. T. C. series, the music was composed by Edwin Astley.",1
"Who dies? is That's the story. This is out there material. "" Hat of to the team that made this one.",1
Worth adding to a weekend pile DVDs.,1
"Also, I have to mention the performance by Alan Cumming. Why haven't I seen more of him? Someone give him more roles please!",1
"I have never before watched a film three times in one night. And, it also resulted in two "" firsts "" for me. I love happy endings. So, I've rated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 other recent films. EIGHTEEN is a Great Film. I wept. I keep notes on all the films I see and rate them. < br / > < br / > Thank you Mr. Bell The Kiss. I'm a 55 - year - old fairly jaded gay white man.",1
"The tender scene of the soldier and his sergeant is male bonding at the crucial moment of death. Eighteen "" is not a gay film. < br / > < br / > Ralph Rewes www.",1
"They were so well acted and very touching. On top of all that he's not a very likable person. Also, the role of the WW11 wounded medic'Macauley'played by'Mark Hildreth. This part just didn't ring true. This movie is extremely good stuff.",1
This film was incredible!,1
"The complex story - in the director's own words in his DVD commentary - is meant to drive a "" vortex of emotion "" pushing Pip to his breaking point, and it certainly accomplishes that. There is also a noteworthy turn by Alan Cummings as a priest who tried to help Pip, and a small supporting role played by Thea Gill ( "" Queer As Folk "" ). "" I do recommend it, 7 stars out of 10, including extra points for a noteworthy effort.",1
"If he wasn't in the Department, he'd be working for KGB or CIA. He's that sort of coldly efficient, ruthless type. King? It's clearly a game to him. A rarity in those days. Imagination, wit, acting which didn't always take itself too seriously... Unlike these, the hero ( es ) weren't left holding an empty bag at the end. He's probably the most fun to watch of the three, although they all have their moments and often, too. I miss it.",1
The parallels of Pi It is Pip's 18th birthday and his father ( Serge Houde ) traces Pip down to give him a present from his deceased grandfather with instructions the gift should be opened on Pip's 18th birthday.,1
But I really feel comfortable when she shows up in the movie. I just loved them and enjoyed watching them. I don't know exactly why. ! It simply leaves me in beautiful mood. But who cares? Are the characters stereotypes or cut outs? Brenda Blethyn is SO great.,1
< But the wait was... somewhat worth it.,1
"We need more Mrs. Bennetts, Bettys and Grace. I saw it on Satellite on dreary Sunday morning. I wish she would make more movies like this and "" Saving Grace. """,1
"( Star Trek funeral, anyone? )",1
"It'the sort of movie that I wish that I could enter, just to experience it. ).",1
"The greatest role, however, is played by the incomparable Christopher Walken ( one of my favorite actors ). Beautiful Naomi Watts is also great as the husband's'secretary ', I'm becoming a bigger fan with every film I see her in. Also, "" Plots With A View "" profits from a wonderful cast.",1
And Walken is at his wacky best. A joy to behold! A farce in the English tradition.,1
"For some reason this is the hardest one in the series to find on DVD. This first film is basically about how she becomes the "" Emanuelle "" that most exploitation cinema fans are familiar with. The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French "" Emmanuelle 2. """,1
"What Betty doesn't know is, Hugh isn't hurting at all. < br / > < br / > 10 stars. In short, film was a pleasure to watch. They'll fake her death. < br / > < br / > Boris, an undertaker, thinks he has the answer.",1
"I mean that in the best way possible. If you ARE, however, this is quirky, with some nice twists and a flowing, natural dialog. < br / > < br / > It rates an 8.",1
When I went to see this movie I hadn't heard much about it and I didn't know what to expect.,1
"I must admit that what attracted me was Christopher Walken. A must see for a nice evening rest, or any time in that case. And the setting was the kind I would like, so I started to watch it.",1
A humorous voyage into the normally somber funeral business.,1
How could I resist. Two funeral directors in a Welsh village?,1
< br / > < br / > The acting is great across the board.,1
This movie is one of the funniest I have seen in years.,1
"Often. Every person is good. You can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot.",1
"The rest of the cast, while virtually unknown to me, turns on great performances too. < br / > < br / > Too bad.",1
As good as SAVINGRACE and LONG LIVE NED DEVINE. A scenario of strange situations starts.,1
This was the film that started that the cinematic love affair < br / > < br / > between the Jaundiced Eye crew and Matthew Ferguson.,1
"< br / > < br / > That is..... until Ruth Marshall got naked. Man, did it drag. Watched this flick on Saturday afternoon cable.",1
Gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993.,1
I was following her emotions and what happened around her. Not for bigots. I felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job.,1
Highly recommended. The screenplay is fluid and believable.,1
"There are many "" panels "" in this quilt. Gibson plays a very convincing gay male of the late 20th Century. Also worthy of praise is Cameron Bancroft's performance. My only regret is that it took 6 years since its release before I discovered this movie!",1
It's very un - politically correct and very kitschy. The photography is very well done in this film.,1
"< br / > < br / > The film's involving and often surprises in its character development. Yes, this film has many gay characters. < br / > < br / > This film is a rewarding experience. Loneliness is a universal experience.",1
"this movie informed, yet managed to avoid preaching to the audience. i thought i knew my history, apparently i didn't know it at all!",1
"The film's has only one flaw, which we'll arrive at later. < br / > < br / > The movie is interesting on a number of levels.",1
Something for everybody? So much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate.,1
"Based upon a true story tells us how the West throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away. < br / > < br / > Tom Hanks was at his usual best, the heavy drinking congressman who saved Afghanistan from its communist oppressors! Great film, a very worthy 7 / 10. Well, it did go away, albeit temporarily.",1
His memorial. ... with a single act. < br / > < br / > Back to the movie.,1
"Director Nichols and Screenwriter : Aaron Sorkin ( A Few Good Men ) keeps things moving and characters are well liked throughout. Charlie Wilson's War "" is a good movie that could have been really great but it's not. 1 Surround Sound.",1
"On the whole, Nichols'direction is workmanlike and follows the action of the script admirably. I'm not much of a fan of Roberts but Hanks is always dependable. < br / > < br / > The story is engaging and is bolstered by a fine script from Aaron Sorkin.",1
But this just makes it sort of hard to take his character serious in the more serious and sensitive / shocking moments of the movie. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. When Tom Hanks is playing his character more playfully and in a more comical kind of way he's just excellent. Consistency is perhaps this movie its biggest problem. The movie because of this feels like it isn't telling the whole story.,1
"It well - written, well - acted, and well - shot. ( Not having read the book, I don't know if George Crile made the same compromise. ) < br / > < br / > There are, however, two complaints I have about the film. < br / > < br / > In terms of film making, Charlie Wilson's War is a definite winner. The second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war.",1
"< br / > < br / > Production on this sexploitation classic is quite impressive, especially the superb cinematography. Unlike D'Amato, director Albert Thomas ( aka Adalberto Albertini, who also made the hard to find YELLOW EMANUELLE, actually a sexed - up version of MADAME BUTTERFLY! ) Okay, so she does make up for this lack of wantonness at the end when she does an entire male hockey team on the train. I kid you not.",1
"It's possible to have a good time with this film while, at the same time, regretting all that it isn't.",1
< br / > < br / > Well that is some of what we saw at least. She was as big of a miscast as I have ever seen. The writing was what was able to really able to take this movie to an above average level. < br / > < br / > The one impressive part of this movie was the writing. In so many scenes I found myself laughing in part by the writing. Hoffman was the glue to this movie. < br / > < br / > The directing was average to me. If it were not for him this movie would have crumbled and hit rock bottom. His performance was by no means stunning but absolutely necessary. The dialog was put together very well and was able to let the story play out. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this movie and I liked Tom Hanks.,1
"Amy Adams witnesses and exist as a character, witnessing. Masterfully structured by Aaron Sorkin via Mike Nichols's own mastery. Nice to see a comedy for grown ups. Hoffman is superb.",1
Aaron Sorking raises the same questions as Shakespeare did or does.,1
The acting is great for the most part as well. Why should anyone care?,1
What more do you want at the movies? His script was a beautiful blend of humor and tragedy. His office staff looked as if he were at the Playboy Mansion. It just wasn't the same.,1
"And then there's Wilson's "" jailbait "" squad of young secretaries that scamper about to keep him happy. Led by the always delightful Amy Adams, each supporting role has its mirthful moments. Politics has never been so much fun.",1
"< br / > < br / > Heartily recommended. But that may have been part of the joke, too. Well, "" Charlie Wilson's War "" is not light comedy. Sorkin's script is brought to life by these actors, and the entire production team is on the top of their game. < br / > < br / > Kudos to both Mr. Hanks and that chameleon Phillip Seymore Hoffman.",1
Huge mansion near the jungle. And Emanuelle beds most of them. Hardly any. BUT GODDESS GEMSER IS BEAUTIFUL.,1
"OK, School - boyish I know but the film is laced with great lines. How wrong was I, because that short scene is as close as the film ever gets to boring. "".",1
"By all accounts Ms It's Easy Street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known, appropriately enough, as Charlie's Angels. Fat chance, huh? He's aided, abetted and abedded by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite played by the still - slinky Julia Roberts. Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid, slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years. It doesn't happen very often, but occasionally one man can make a difference - - a big difference.",1
"The film is based on George Crile's fat book of the same title. I was not a fan of "" Closer "", so it's refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy set in the darkest of circumstances. Mike Nichols in finest form.",1
"With a bit less preachy dialogue, this movie would be 10. This film grabs you from the opening scenes and never lets go. He's a likable fellow. Highly recommended.",1
"For a little B picture, The Man Behind Mask is good movie - making for its time. The story is well - paced, has some interesting twists, and gives Lorre many opportunities to shine.",1
< br / > < br / > High recommended. It only played late at night ( past midnight ). He turns to a life of crime and eventually becomes very successful.,1
"This was the first movie I ever saw at the Parkway Drive - in, here in Toronto.",1
"I got a kick out of it though, and I'm sure anyone reading this knows if they're up for it. And that's the strength of this film. When she dies in the hospital, Kevin vows revenge, much to the chagrin of his detective father. You never know what to expect next. < br / > < br / > Meet yuppie college student Kevin and his gang of lovable frat boy buddies.",1
< br / > < br / > The key is in the film's subject matter.,1
This movie will not disappoint you.,1
"As a soccer referee, I have yet to see a movie or TV show get it right when depicting a match. "" Sadly, far too many coaches are like Flagstaff'- - or worse. I don't care what the tradition and macho image is.",1

75 out of 10.,1
That is Hollywood. It focuses on a STORY.,1
"Something entertaining. Hollywood is never 100 % correct in their productions. They are taught to become men, and not temporal vain boys.",1
It made us laugh and cry. The film was inspirational as well as entertaining. My family truly enjoyed this movie.,1
< br / > < br / > Enjoy! < br / > < br / > The acting and directing are good.,1

Neil McDonough was especially convincing. It'good to see a quality film like this from the Beehive State.,1
"Man, I can't stop laughing. ; Everything the actors said were funny, like how Kurt says, "" I worship you, like GOD! "" On that part, I kept saying "" Remember, Remember? "" I think this movie has got it all. to the robot. I wish I had that movie. ) It has cool looking characters.",1
"One can almost smell the tourtiere being cooked slowly over a wood stove. I'm from Ontario, and this film made me fall in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard va toujours viv dans nos coeurs.",1
Swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances. There were only a few scenes that were far fetched.,1
I am not even New Zealander and I was proud of their culture. ! Mother of pearls!!! Must see movie! I was proud! Loved it!,1
< br / > < br / > The Performances. He reminded me an awful lot of a young Tom Cruise cocky yet very charismatic and talented. Sean Faris is outstanding as Rick Penning.,1
"however, like i said it is a film under the Hollywood treatment. Althogether it is a decent film and bring to the attention the morals and ideas behind the game of rugby. Is generally a feel good movie that is enjoyable but has flaws in terms of it's portrayal of the game.",1
"It may seem too good to be true, but that's what's so amazing about it. If it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more. Thanks! < br / > < br / > Go see this movie and post your review ( positive or negative )! These are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate. The fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me. Not so with Forever Strong. Instead, the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person. ).",1
"It reminds me of "" We Are Marshall "", but with a smaller budget and an independent movie feel. Set that aside, this movie is very rewarding piece of film noir.",1
"It is not something that they just threw into the movie. The uniform is based off of the All Blacks as well. Oh, and this is gonna be a long post, I can tell already. I, myself am part Hawaiian. Really, how many sports movies really make you feel like you are in the game? As for the person from China (? ) It's Hollywood, not ESPN! Not many that I have seen.",1
The acting is great in the movie.,1
! He learns a lesson. Kronk is retarded!,1
It's a total classic. The writing is what really makes this show. It never degrades into fart jokes or anything of that type.,1
"< br / > < br / > And Patrick Warburton. Oh, well. Two out of three ain't bad. He has a softer voice but it fits somehow. It's funny how much the character looks like her, though.",1
The real star of the film is newcomer Edison Chen. ! Smoorenburg also is the stunt double for Rudd.,1
I just love this show.,1
"If your looking for educational value this isn't your show. If your just looking for something funny this is a great Saturday morning pick! It's not as good as the movie, that said it's a cute kids show. It's really a rare and wonderful combination.",1
"Some of it is even reminiscent of Shrek - - self - referential humor. Once you watch an episode, it never really comes to mind ever again.",1
( Just stop complaining about everything! ),1
And it seems to be High School rather than College.,1
"), this was not the focus of the film. It was just fun. Virtual Sexuality did this for me and that's not a bad thing!",1
"Americans wouldn't really feel the emotional attachment, but every British teenager should watch it. Being from London, where Virtual Sexuality is set, I felt a strong emotional attachment to it.",1
That's not a bad thing IMO. ).,1
Very very funny.,1
"Go see it! Don't listen to the critics, Star Wars fans didn't. And no, I'm not a teenager.",1
"Then suddenly there is an explosion in gas pipe and her creation comes to life. I'll say no more, you'll have to watch the movie, which is quite fun to watch.",1
I was cracking up. This movie is so funny. Remember this and you will have great time watching Virtual Sexuality. I love this movie.,1
"It's enjoyable, and a vaguely feel - good movie.",1
"Overall, this film is hilarious. I am also a big fan of the music used.",1
"This film, won't win any awards for greatness. < br / > < br / > Get some wine and some ice cream have a chuckle.",1
I found it very entertaining ( of course the fact that it stars the gorgeous Laura Fraser is a bonus! ) Very strange. I really can't see why people seem to dislike this film.,1
"This Movie Was a Murder Mystery, Plain & Simple. Mr. Faulkner Did His Hometown of OXFORD, Miss.",1
"Basically... just see it if ya can... ! I am having a holiday in hong kong now, and i just saw gen y cops at the cinema.... what can i say... it was sooo cool!!",1
"Had it not been for To Kill A Mockingbird, this movie would be much more famous. Nothing changed in race relations and some may say nothing has changed even now, these many years later. But pride from either is no answer at all. Not the comfort that Addicus brings with his presence. Perhaps it was inspired by this very similar movie. < br / > < br / > There's not the depth of Mockingbird here.",1
"But to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. I suppose the burden of a history of racism is difficult for any Southerner to bear and I can understand that. Sometimes black and white people got along because of genuine affection and understanding. Segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical fact.",1
with many of the residents used as extras. Porter Hall has a great role as the murdered man's father.,1
"The Courthouse, City Hall, etc. I wish they'd play it more often. Very moving. On par with the quality of the movie "" To Kill a Mocking Bird "".",1
! that was a very evocative and stylish film with some superb music.,1
"The setting is perfectly realized. That's a credit to the rich characterization of everyone else. Lucas Beauchamp ( Juano Hernandez ) is something of an anomaly in this small town. It is actually filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown. < br / > < br / > The film has an uncommon frankness for its time and is mostly free of moralizing. Chick asks his Uncle John, a lawyer, to defend Lucas and while the man is initially bothered by his own notions he agrees and they race against gathering mob to save Lucas'life.",1
"Old man Lucas is not very likable. They're not the faces of Hollywood extras. That way we're forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic. Wisely, the script refuses to sweeten him up. < br / > < br / > Note how the movie doesn't attack segregation. He's a victim and we sympathize, but he's also haughty and unfriendly.",1
Most of the extras were locals.,1
"Faulkner since college, I was especially pleased to see Intruder In the Dust and for other reasons. We attended a week long family reunion at Oxford in July, 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie. It really captured the intensity of rural Southern whites that Faulkner wrote so incisively about so often. As a fan of Wm. Other Faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare.",1
"Just meant to be enjoyed, that'all. I hope they make another soon. This is a well done action movie. At least RS1 had the right idea by killing him. The plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie. IT ISN'T SUPPOSED TO REQUIRE THOUGHT!",1
"The crowd could really care less about the details - - they are just hell - bent on a hanging. See both films if you can. Fortunately, a young white man ( Claude Jarmin ) begins to wonder about Juano's innocence and begins seeking out the truth. See it with your kids if you have a chance - - it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.",1
but they did a pretty good job here. A true must see for Faulkner fans.,1
"Stevens is probably the single most common character in all of Faulkner's fiction. He has pride, and many in the white population find that an execrable quality in a black man. Stevens refuses ; the case seems open and shut.",1
"This straightforward, tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves to be seen more.",1
This is a 1972 Disney movie. I definitely recommend it to all ages. And it still is!,1
It may not be a 10 out of 10 but for me the jokes didn't fail.,1
I highly recommend this movie! I love this movie!,1
"He actually concocts a liquid that makes him invisible. This is a companion movie to the TCWT but one need not have seen the first film to enjoy this one. But, wait, Dexter does it!",1
"Loads of fun, folks! < br / > < br / > Cute, well made and clever. I like the Inki cartoons.",1
"So is rap music. Get over it. If a joke doesn't offend anybody, it isn't funny.",1
; - ) Genius or utter madness? HILARIOUS!!!,1
"At least for me. I really like that lion. The artwork isn't extraordinary, but good enough.",1
This cult classic ( previously only seen atcifi conventions ) is a party favorite. Lots of funny moments! This 60min film shows just how much fun filmmaking can be.,1
He also said that I'd love it.,1
"A doctor with a brain no less! Worthwhile seeing, especially for Y & R fans.",1
I usually steer clear of Film Festivals and don't enjoy slap - stick comedy but I must say that this picture was great. The blending of segways is done beautifully and the overall product is wonderfully tasteful.,1
"This really is a great film. No doubt, they were moved to help him tell this beautiful story. David Krumoltz carries the film with his understated intensity and honesty.",1
"I went it to see this film with caution. It's also extremely intelligent, yet simple. It'funny - And, I also felt that characters were real and vibrant. A suicidal "" comedy "" didn't seem consistent. I give it a 9 and will recommend it.",1
"On a scale of 1 - 10 "" Suicidal Sweetheart "" got an 11 from me and from everyone else at this showing. The picture was incredibly funny.",1
"I highly recommend "" My Suicidal Sweetheart "". You will not be disappointed. - MERK The acting, by a top notch cast is terrific.",1
"I saw the film at SXSW at it's premier and it turned out to be the best film there by far. I think I got it and it seemed like most everyone else did as well. I don't think you can say much bad about the film, unless you didn't get it.",1
This film works. I can go on and on... The real star here is the brilliant screenplay. I see a great career ahead for Mr. Parness.,1
"Think more dramedy than comedy. She manages to convince us of Grace's deep seated desperation that lies just beneath her alternating torpor and mania. This film is one of them. Few succeed. David Krumholtz, in the titular lead role and as narrator, anchors the picture and does an exceptional job. Guillermo Diaz is a wanton scene stealer as delightfully frenetic oddball, Hector. The most humorous scenes are those populated by the myriad of name actors in supporting roles.",1
Overall i give it a 6.,1
"I like watching David Krumholtz in anything he does and have followed his career for a few years now. I identified with not having a story book romance and liked seeing dysfunction at it's best. I question why that didn't happen. I gave Max and Grace a ten because these interesting, unique, creative Indie films deserve an audience.",1
The film is REALLY exceptional. Why?,1
Casablanca was right around the corner. Why does the monkey upset him so much.,1
Lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they haven't seen it. < br / > < br / > I just caught this for the first time on a late night / early morningCM showing.,1
Lorre is the reason that one falls into this. Peter Lorre gives one of his most evil performances as the owner of the titled place. His quite demeanor is unnerving.,1
"Laurel plays a Scottish naive young person who arrives in America in full kilt. < br / > < br / > Great good clean fun, just nothing too remarkable or memorable all.",1
"Im usually wary of movies hovering around the 6 / 10 mark on IMDb. Id like to think people know what they are talking about and know what they like. I am personally interested in the paranormal / have read a bit about near death experiences, so automatically i was hooked. See this movie. < br / > < br / > Wow! Anyway, landing the plane here - i had rented this movie out before and hadn't had time to watch it, this morning i did.",1
"Yes, Julia Roberts is here too and very good. Platt has some really good lines and plays paranoia well. This core of actors acts and reacts off each other very nicely.",1
"This movie was made in one of my favorite years too, 1990!! ! At the same time, once their desultory curiosity has gotten the better of them, there is no turning back!!",1
"The first flat - liner is haunted by a young kid who tortures him when he is alone. At the risk of getting euthanized by some revenge - taking doctor reader, let me continue. He hopes to get it answered ( and become famous ) through applied science.",1
Their flashbacks are like children's nightmares. I suspect that director Joel Schumacher did.,1
"Amazing! Where did William Baldwin go, he's great. It's freaky but not too scary and it makes you think.",1
! and by the way we wrote 12 lines!,1
"And how will they get rid of them? < br / > < br / > The director is Joel Schumacher, who had already worked with Sutherland in'Lost Boys ', and this second cooperation is even better than the first.",1
Anyway I suggest it to all that watch it once. Never able to understand few things in life.,1
< br / > < br / > I bought the DVD of flatliners at the modest price of 5 pounds. But then there sins come back in reality and can harm them physically. < br / > < br / > This is an edgy andtylish thriller bound to please nay type of film fan. Got home and watched it. And Joel Schmacheur made this a great movie like he did with the lost boys.,1
"There are lots of laughs all around. It shows he wasn't a one - trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance. He has been told that Philip is a good boy, but he has one weakness - - women.",1
"Nostalgia isn't always the best reason to watch a movie. If there's an explanation why Flatliners was forgotten, it might be because 1990 saw the release of another, far superior, supernatural thriller : Jacob's Ladder.",1
I really enjoy this movie. David Labraccio played by Kevin Bacon an atheist end up questioning his own belief about God. Then it's gets very dramatic by bringing back his wrong doing from the past to life.,1
"Besides the all - star cast, this movie had some serious bite to it. A nail - biter, white knuckle, edge - of - the - seat, hard nose thriller. I give it an 8 / 10.",1
Technically it is possible but the result is not surprising. It reactivates old guilty feelings and frustrations that had been buried into the unconscious. Religion is declared dead. The film though is interesting but in something quite different. That was quite typical of the end of the 20th century.,1
< br / > < br / > Past ghosts come back to haunt them and surely this movie will haunt anyone. < br / > < br / > See it with a haunted past. It's a good movie to see when it'raining and you're feeling down. It's also a little weird.,1
JL Can't get much eerier than Flatliners. And what can you say for the rest of the cast?,1
"Certain plot twists and themes are a little off the mark, and the acting occasionally goes over the top. Highly recommended.",1
Yet the storyline hasn't been designed as fascinating as the idea of the plot. This inner personality keeps one from altering into identity loss.,1
"out of 10 stars. Very Gothic and atmospheric. Ahh, the good old days. Anyway, this is a great flick, perhaps not for fundamentalist Christians but many others may enjoy it.",1
"Stan Laurel regarded PUTTING PANTS ON PHILIP as the first true'L & H film. This, therefore, is an historic and very important film in the history of comedy. Hilarious.",1
One of Schumacher'best ; highly recommended. Their believable performances help to raise this movie well above average. Kiefer Sutherland shines in his egotistical med - student role.,1
"< br / > < br / > 8 / 10. William Baldwin portrays a student who excel in class and, apparently, intercourse. And Oliver Platt, in another outstanding performance, portrays the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent. When I first watched Flatliners, I was amazed.",1
"'and failed to see the artistry and psychological depth of the piece. 'or ` Why would medical students pull such a stupid stunt? I like my movies a bit left of center - unpredictable and fresh. < br / > < br / > First, a note about the artistic quality of the movie.",1
"The basic premise of Flatliners is fairly simple. < br / > < br / > Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, really shines as the lead. Flatliners recognises that people go to films to be entertained, not moralised to. In this kind of supernatural thriller, the difference this restraint makes is really incredible. We can try to change the past as much as we like, but it's what we do with the present that matters most. I am not sure which.",1
Obey the D!,1
"< br / > < br / > Explosivo. Don't know what it's about, But it's good to go. We've come to freaking'blow, We've come to blow show. Fuelled by Satan!",1
ex.,1
Just Go see this movie. Seriously awesome music.,1
On the way they meet The Stranger Played By Tim Robbins. !,1
And the songs are inspired low - brow hilarity. Recommended.,1
This movie does stay true to it's roots. The soundtrack is phenomenal and each song blows you away.,1
"I loved this movie!! What more could someone want? This movie has something for everyone : rock, drugs, and Satan.",1
I absolutely loved every minute of this film. Watch out for the inside jokes from first album! I'll let you see whether they make it or not. A must see for anyone who calls themselves a tenacious D fan.,1
"Pick "" will make you giggle a bit... but is it worth 9 bucks? I don't think so. I expected a few chuckles, but as I have never been a huge fan of Tenacious D, not much more then that. Just be sure it's your style. The story is every bit as absurd as it sounds, and this is not film you see if you want a real plot.",1
I was lucky enough to win free passes to the sneak preview of POD. You honestly wouldn't know from seeing the film that that is him. That is f - ing hilarious! The movie absolutely rocked!,1
"It rocked hard, and yet it also rocked tasty.",1
"The best part is that it lives up to my visions! It's not a true story, but who cares. Nobody can top their show! : D Long live D!!!",1
Probably the best comedy in a long time. keeps you laughing nonstop!,1
One of the best ever. I highly recommend this movie to any body that'ever rocked out.,1
And if you should be unhappy with the ending of'White -'Red'puts an happy end to the whole trilogy.,1
"They're on the Tenacious D Masterworks DVD, which is available for rent at pretty much every video store.",1
It'll give you good laugh! I don't like the way the movie ends.,1
"< br / > < br / > See This Movie Now! Hands Down. Plenty of inside jokes from past Tenacious D albums, and HBO shows.",1
"The movie is hilarious and delivers non - stop laughs. The film is in part, a musical.",1
Especially those that love rock music. < br > < br / > Overall Vote : 10 out of 10! This movie was amazing!!!!,1
Go see it. ).,1
"If for nothing other than the music itself, this movie is worth the price of admission. Go see it! !",1
"Last week we saw "" Borat "" and loved it, but this is honest to goodness TEN TIMES BETTER. For anyone who truly loves rock music and comedic brilliance, see this film. With Tenacious D's "" The Pick of Destiny, "" this is not the case.",1
I'll leave it there. I saw this movie on a fluke.,1
My favorite film. A wonder. Wow.,1
"< br / > < br / > Just see "" Le Cercle noir "" and be prepared to be delicious entertained. I was sorry when this long film ended. But I guess it's like jazz : either you get it, or you don't, so why waste time trying to explain.",1
"However, the director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements. The film boils down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off nicely. The film does feature crime filmtapes such as shootings, but they are kept to a minimum.",1
"Meville has this tendency of concentrating on too many trivial details. I don't even think this is the best example of the much - loved heist subgenre. Still, the movie is never boring.",1
"This mannered fatalism is something of a self - indulgent notion. They're born innocent but it doesn't last. "" The point of the movie, in my view, is nonsense... but the movie itself is a first - class experience. Their theme is that it isn't what one does, but how one does it.",1
"< br / > < br / > Melville made unique crime movies. Fate decides to join these two men to pull off a spectacular heist. There's nothing romantic about them. They're society's unwanted, living in the night, always one step ahead of the police in a game they know they'll lose eventually. In the background there is Matei ( André Bourvil ), the detective Vogel escapes from, implacable in his pursuit and sometimes ruthless in his methods.",1
"Because of this, I had a hard time giving this excellent film a higher score.",1
How good is this film? Melville makes the film ; they make it better. The can't make it work like he did.,1
His inclusion into the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. < br / > < br / > Many of the scenes play out very slowly. Jansen is hired as the sure shot gun man.,1
"When the movie ends, you can only feel sorry.",1
A wild actor. He < br / > < br / > Melville is wrong. That is what the film is all about. The circle closes. The great Henri Decae is as usual the lighting cameraman.,1
its so genuine. its a brilliant thriller. it keeps you at the edge of your seat till the end.,1
"Delon is a hoodlum. Stylistically, it's a success. Or masks ; yet the portrayal is inspired, economic but suggestive. Montand is a sick, failed cop.",1
"Instead, things go far worse for them than they really need to, within the logic of the story. These are guys who really ought to be due for a break! It's French, arty, under - played to the point of agony, and ultimately downbeat. But that's not shown either.",1
"In that department, he was one of the best. < br / > < br / > Once again, Melville's direction is superb. Le Cercle Rouge "" proves that as a filmmaker Melville improved as he continued. Tarantino must've seen this before making "" Reservoir Dogs "".",1
"Even Corey's movements involving a photograph of a woman arouse interest. Though his film has dialog, it is mainly to keep the film's scenes rolling along, adherent to the plot.",1
"And even if the remake will be made, try to avoid it before seeing great original first. So what I'm saying is that this is one of the greatest films ever made, together with another film by Melville - Le Samourai. Watch it.",1
"Everyone likes the coolly created, memorable heist movie.",1
"The men here never lose control and never - not once - show their emotions. THE RED CIRCLE ( Jean - Pierre Melville - France / Italy 1970 ). He also claimed he wanted to shoot a film noir in colour and in many ways he succeeded. No dramatic outbursts in this film. < br / > < br / > This might be the coolest film ever made, in the most literal sense of the term. Why was Corey ( Alain Delon ) in jail? Everyone is cool all the time.",1
"< br / > < br / > Alain Delon always responded with interesting performances his appearances in Mellville's pictures. Bourvil gives an enormously satisfying performance as Mattei showing equal parts of determination and tenderness, as it's the case with the three cats he adores. The score is by Eric Demarsan that emphasizes a jazzy music that accompanies most of action. Not having seen this film in quite some time, we caught with it not long ago in the nicely transferred Criterion DVD. "" He didn't fill his pictures with a lot of dialog, as it's the case here.",1
The ending is exceptional. There is a ship wreck. Their relation is brotherhood - like. The man and the woman finally meet. Nothing has happened between them. He told her his life. Meanwhile the woman has met an old man.,1
"The opening seen was bitchin. She is hot, hot HOT!",1
"She'definitely a looker. Of course, the girls in the film are lots of fun to watch too.",1
The action is top notch! Must see movie! For this i have to give credit to Russel Wong! You get the impression it is a large district. But not many come close to the action shown in John Woo movies!,1
China White ( 1989 ) was Ronny Yu's first international film. I haven't seen Hong Kong version. That would be a huge treat for me.,1
"Armand Assante, one of my favorite actors of all time, was born to play the charming vampire with savage intensity. < br / > < br / > Another thing that interested me is that the central location is the Borgo Hotel.",1
Set looks cool lots of detail at the Borgo Hotel and cool special effects at end. Alicia and Charles ( Robert Floyd ) try to stay alive while gore keeps your lust for blood sated.,1
"I learned that from "" Jeopardy! A real classic. "".",1
Co - Starring in his first American film is CONRAD VEIDT with his'cadaverous spider'interpretation of'Louis XI '. < br / > < br / > United Artists spared no expense in this handsome production supervised by WILLIAM CAMERON MENZIES. The copy on DVD that we watched from'Delta Entertainment'came from a good master. There is a touch of reality here.,1
Simply brilliant! Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements.,1
"I was also pretty excited to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces. However, the performance I had a serious problem with was Conrad Veidt as King Louis XI. Slim Summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to films. To call this "" unsubtle "" would be a gross understatement. While Veidt was wonderful in many, many films ( both silent and sound ) but here he is just ridiculous.",1
It seems Villon carried out his exile from Paris at the Hostel of the Lame Flea! Not exactly exuding the confidence a King of France might be expected to bear. How true.,1
And the snow.,1
And Veidt is such a wonderful scene stealer ( doesn't he pick his nose at one point? ) And nothing wrong in that! Heartily endorse the comments of boblipton and Snow Leopard. < br / > < br / > See!,1
"Crosland was a careful, innovative, delightfully original director, and it is a shame that more of his works are not known. Superb silent version of the story of Francois Villon. < br / > < br / > It is a shame that Barrymore did so few first - rate comedies. If so, you could do far worse. He even gets to leap around in the swashbuckling style of Fairbanks, most convincingly.",1
TV without a Jimmy G show is missing something.,1
"This show was a really good one in many ways, although certainly an atypical Western with the hero (? ) By then, Margot Kidder was famous as Lois Lane but I'll also always think of her as Nichols'girlfriend.",1
What a shame. I remember Nichols! I was just 17 when it was on.,1
). NBC?,1
"It was small town stuff, but it was excellent. < br / > < br / > It was set in a 1900 western town. NBC's advertisers were getting a bargain from NBC's ignorance. Garner was playing a sheriff who did not want to use violence to do his duties.",1
"The characters are not very believable, are idealized, are schematic. There is still plenty of joy to be had here.",1
Guerrilla suppression operations are always like that. It's a movie Westerners should watch. Someone will always pick up the gun and shoot you cause they care more about the land.,1
"Some food for thought as to why Afghan war as lost.. Not the best war movie made, but profound and intelligent enough to be worth watching.",1
"He is not depicted as a eager believer, on the contrary he is depicted as tactful and responsible officer. < br / > < br / > Script and actor's play are also very realistic.",1
"Uhodim rebyata! < br / > < br / > There is no lack of powerful scenes. in a tone of sincere relief. The Soviet army cooperated quite a bit during filming, which is odd. < br / > < br / > An earlier comment describes the last scene with Maj. Bandura as illogical.",1
All movie team had to escape sometimes even under fire. I would recommend this as the most successful attempt so far to make a movie on Soviet Afghan war. It's been shot in Tajikistan just after the the troop withdrawal which happened in 1989 not in 1985.,1
"And his secret is in the ""prezzatura ""! The film "" Hitch "" is worth watching for the embodiment of the "" sprezzzatura "" concept in the dynamic performance of Will Smith. But this film is driven by the charm and winsome personality of Smith.",1
"But, he likes Sara, so keeps going after her. I recommend it. < br / > < br / > FINAL VERDICT : Good, has some laughs, and is entertaining. Hitch charms her, so of course, they go out. So of course, she thinks he's a pig. Albert is a klutz and goof and always tripping on his feet or what - not. Smith plays, Hitch, a date doctor. This movie was much better than I expected. So Sara tracks the doctor down, only to learn its Hitch.",1
Besides relationships have there serious moments. Boy meets girl or in this case boys met girls. However the way it happened in this movie was refreshing. Sometimes these are one of the same. Okay the formula is standard. Yes it did.,1
"As I've said in the title of this review, It pains me to say this, but "" hitch "" reaches the zenith of what Hollywood Romantic Comedies can ever hope to aspire to.",1
Daddy will always Love you Julia. Her messages are always very short. Smiths character Hitch is a date doctor. It is a curious pattern.,1
The color dominates the visuals of the movie. Both themes are loosely woven together in the story.,1
"Amber Valletta was good enough. I hope to see more of her in the future. I enjoyed Julie Ann Emery, and wish she'd had a larger part.",1
"Over the past century, there have been many advances in gender equality, but not so much in the world of movies. Will Hitch be able to balance his private life and his job? Well, Hitch ain't that movie. Hitch, the latest Will Smith vehicle attempts to change that trend by being a chick flick which throws in a dose of male perspective. I'm not talking about what goes on behind the camera, I'm referring to the tastes of the audience. And more importantly, can Hitch believe in love again?",1
"Hitch's character is witty and wise, sometimes managing to be both at once.",1
"I really laughed. I mean really happy. Being yourself. < br / > < br / > Fun. In this movie, I did. Maybe it's Will's face.",1
"Smith was excellent, never schmaltzing it up too much. < br / > < br / > And in end, that's the main message of this film. Don't know her name, but she was pretty good too.",1
"This a great "" blind date "" file too. What ever you do don't miss the DVD extras. ! A chick flick that Guys still like - Yes! Remember Hitch's advice!! The ending makes feel good moments worth it.",1
"< br / > < br / > Meet Alex Hitchens ( Will Smith ), aka Hitch. "".",1
He must love a challenge I guess. He's just a normal human being in this movie which was really nice. There are no jaw dropping effects nor is he showing off his beefed up body.,1
"This was a romantic, simple funny movie. It was great.",1
He was so darn funny. Will Smith does not do anything slow. I laughed so hard. He knows how to make us all laugh.,1
"Never has remorseless, unsparing honesty been quite so beautiful.",1
"I recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is or have been in love. Making a marvelous point about love, and how falling in love affects us. However, for the most part, the film was funny. Those who don't believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes. The plot follows Smith as he works on his self - proclaimed most difficult such case ; Kevin James. This movie has a suggestion... and it works relatively well.",1
"Fortunately, they make it brief and unsappy. Will Smith was funny and good. OK, OK, I must say I was impressed.",1
< br / > < br / > It rates a 7.,1
"Not having seen the film in its commercial debut, we just caught with it via DVD. < br / > < br / > Will Smith is a charismatic actor. Eva Mendez is fine as main interest of Hitch. He has a disarming way to charm without doing much.",1
"The mix of comedy, romance, and drama left me feeling complete. ! I was stunned and amazed.",1
I expected a good movie. !,1
No. This film was about the vulnerability of peoples'hearts.,1
He was well cast in this. It has romance AND slapstick. There is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy. < br / > < br / > I definitely recommend this movie.,1
"Not everyone can understand a film like this, but it's quite rewarding to those who do.",1
Her explanation was unconvincing. The first is the major point of why did Alex give stuff away. < br / > < br / > On the whole I enjoyed it quite a bit.,1
It is riveting from beginning to end. My only criticism is its poor production values.,1
"< br / > < br / > And why, you may wonder? I have read the last comment made on this film and have to utterly and totally disagree with it. Well, firstly, this film deals with two sibling nations : Portugal and Brazil.",1
This is reality.,1
"The best one comes in a listening booth. They talk, they like each other. A really mathematic screenwriter's work for this film.",1
Isabel has just gone out of jail.,1
"She earns her keep by carrying a bucket around and washing shop windows. She loves this man as he is, without question, and without him having to change, which is a rare find anywhere. They eat a bakery roll every day and consider it a feast. She runs across the anti - hero of the story and her boyfriend, played by Sebastian Haro, as he's parking cars for change. Both characters come from extremely broken homes and therefore the audience has sympathy for them despite their imperfections.",1
"This hard story has place to humour, love and obviously dramatic sense.",1
"It is a enjoyable movie. < br / > < br / > The story by itself is moving. I believe his role. < br / > < br / > On the other hand, I don't quite believe the role of Isabel Ampudia.",1
The show is also very funny. Not just thrown in gratuitously.,1
"If you have, just come back to it!! ! I use IMDB very much.",1
"on a scale of 1 - 10, I give this film a 117. I also recommend book in both French and English. Go Habs Go.",1
< br / > < br / > Many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital TV and i hope it may long continue after season 4. I don't usually comment on films or TV shows but had to post a comment about Las Vegas.,1
Ever. This show is awesome! He can be hilarious. I never want show to end. They keep up an excellent pace.,1
"A true pro. Wonderful actor. And of course, there is James Caan. Frankly i just enjoy watching James Caan. Just marvelous.",1
"? Mustn't forget the rest of the cast : James, Vanessa ( yum! )",1
< br / > < br / > The story lines are very fun and weird at times.,1
"If you don't like it, don't watch it, that what we have a million channels for! ( Firefly and Jake 2. It's the sort of place where we can go and pretty much do what we want when we want ( subject to funds obviously! ).",1
The show uses cool high - tech surveillance equipment to bring down the cheats and schemers. < br / > < br / > Las Vegas is a show that can appeal to both male and female audiences. It features fantastic characters lead by the charismatic tough - guy Ed Deline ( James Caan ). An excellent way to end a season!,1
I think Josh Duhamel is so great!! ! Josh is definitely a HUNK!!,1
PLEASE BRING BACK VEGAS! What does NBC have now? Tom Sellecks addition was great.,1
That was funny. She should have got an Emmy in my opinion. I wish they hadn't killed her off. Lara Flynn Boyle was awesome in her guest role.,1
"Red, however, is the real thing. < br / > < br / > How's that for a contention? The greatest movie ever. In fact, what he expresses is _ how _ it is to feel human.",1
!,1
< br / > < br / > That is certainly not the case with this program. Don't know why I didn't sooner?? The guest actors are well - chosen.,1
"Personally, i love this movie.",1
it's so great!! !,1
"I must admit that I am a fan of cheesy'80's cartoons, but this is among the best. Have a Rainbow - Day!",1
HARDLY!! !,1
: ) All movies created to sell dolls to kids. It's pure smarmy cheese.,1
"Additionally, I think of the plot with higher regard because I now see the moral and symbolism. Today, I still love the characters.",1
"She did, and still we feel very heavy at heart. Brilliant film. Deep, dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely. The main heroine, played by ever great Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model.",1
"Maybe they wanted too much money? < br / > < br / > So anyway,notty, evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels it's power to take Rainbow's belt.. imagine?",1
"Lo. I adored this, but I am an 80's kid. I loved Rainbow Bright my whole childhood.",1
I first saw this movie when I was very little. You're only a child once so don't let them miss out on this one! I became addicted to it. I would recommend to any parent with young children to rent this movie. My mother taped it one day thinking I might like it. It will trigger their imagination and provide plenty of entertainment. I am very glad I had an opportunity to see this movie when I was little.,1
It's a great kids movie. She's funny.,1
"However, I liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it. If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical.",1
"! You were all kids once. IT'S A KIDS MOVIE!!!! If not, then it'bad.",1
Most of those people would not appreciate the great things that are 80's cartoons.,1
You probably do to. Especially the outrageous Princess character. And the robotic horse. Have fun! Most people feel that way about her.,1
"But instead he made himself all the more recognisable. Nobody ever unmasked him. Poor Tonto, on the other hand, became his Aunt Sally. < br / > < br / > Devine daftness. 'Kemosabe'; what the hell's that? 'King Savvy'was general consensus where I lived.",1
I think it's the same with this film.,1
"You never see the face of the man who becomes the Lone Ranger, as it's always turned away or obscured to hide his real identity. Would that relate, say, to sterling..., silver? Tonto ( Jay Silverheels ) declares his companion a'trusty scout ', and names him Kemo - sabe. I got the biggest kick out of that.",1
"The trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question : "" who was that masked man? < br / > < br / > Then again, what do I know? The Lone Ranger is totally good but he adopts the guise of evil. For most of the original broadcast years the series was ABC's most watched piece of programming. "".",1
"In this, we heartily concur! < br / > < br / > The "" New Technology "" was, of course was TELEVISION! Virtually all would be ripe for adaptation to the TV Screen. The year was 1933 when the Ranger first rode out to "" the Plains of Early Western United States! """,1
"The Lone Ranger said, "" kemo - sabe, that is familiar? Tonto said, "" you are Kemosabe "".",1
"There is a self deprecating, iconoclastic tone to the movie that is very appealing. This is a very funny movie. The characters are interesting.",1
Good job to all. This film proves you don't need a Hollywood budget to make something fun to watch.,1
More realistic true to life cinema is lacking in this time of CG and green screens. I'd like to see any L. A. director go through the guerrilla process to get a shot.,1
I am hard to please in the documentary category.,1
"there's a lot of stuff about punk rock, and the philosophy behind that movement and it's relationship to this project. watch this movie.",1
The sex scene was really cool. I love it!,1
I was laughing in the end scene. A work of a master.,1
"The editing cuts provide as much drama as the dialog therein. It hearkens back to the credibility of the first wave of American hardcore music when the term "" D. I. Y. "" In the truest sense of term. Not that there isn't plenty of technique or style to this... the tone of the documentary is quite refreshing.",1
Everyone who has ever wondered how to make a film on no budget should see this documentary.,1
"And be sure to watch / read the credits - they're the icing on the cake! Punk! Gotta love Stu, though. But the movie itself captured the whole punk genre. The music, well of course.",1
I especially liked the music written by Ed Ivey.,1
I enjoyed the comparisons the film made of punk rock file making to punk rock music.,1
< br / > < br / > Loved it! Great piece.,1
A truly entertaining tale and a guaranteed learning experience for the viewer. < br / > < br / > This is a great tale of dedication and the treacher that can occur along the path to wonderful movie making.,1
All of the trials and tribulations of making a no budget movie right from the mouths of those involved.,1
google.,1
I hope it gets around. The different people are all interesting and there is never really too much of one person. Definitely a worthwhile film.,1
"He lost his ability to love other people and animals. Both women play same essential role in his psychology, of the one (! ) I believe I share the same psychological outlook on the world with Kieslowski.",1
"If that is so, this is appropriate way to go out. This movie to me felt like closure.",1
"True to "" Homicide "" form, there were no happy endings, such is life.",1
I think it is time to increase that group to 2.,1
!,1
"For all the Homicide junkies out there, this movie was great! It helped to resolve some ( but not all ) issues from the series.",1
This is the final episode we deserved. 'Is death justified by reasoning?'',1
My guess is Bayless of course. This is a series I wish had lived on. Thanks to cast for some wonderful TV.,1
It hurt to see that this was the end of Homicide. I enjoyed this a lot.,1
This is a good film. Gee runs for mayor and gets shot. Yes.,1
- Some books falling to the pavement. - Human fortunes marked by the most ill - fated coincidence. Are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen's everyday's life?,1
"But'G'isn't ready to really retire - retire yet. < br / > < br / > It was almost as if the series with the full title of "" HOMICIDE : LIFE ON THE STREET "" ( 1993 - 99 ) was a sort of "" Mr. Alive, but in a comatose state, he is taken to the Hospital. In - Between "" of series. So, instead of a rocking chair o a fishing rod, we find that Al is running for Mayor of'Charm City. < br / > < br / > OUR STORY. It was too big to just cancel, but too small to get a case of'Rabid Ratings Ravings'over.",1
Loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season. And the movie certainly retained that spirit.,1
EVER!,1
"Story - wise, I found this film somewhat lacking. The movie brings out that sense of "" family "", not only amongst the characters, but amongst the actors, as well. Now, if they'd just release it on DVD... ). Having said that, "" Homicide : The Movie "" is still a great watch.",1
"< br / > < br / > Let me just say, I was not disappointed at all.",1
< br / > < br / > Vote :,1
One I would definitely suggest watching.,1
"This film will touch you. She was willing to share her death experience as an act of love for her son. The story is one which can make you laugh, but also cry as it addresses issues we all must face.",1
I would highly recommend it.,1
"In this way it is an uplifting and profound hopeful film. I expected it to be a very harrowing, depressing movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > The performances are perfect, sublime. Don't Miss it. Piotr Sobocinsk Cinematography is also outstanding he got an Oscar nod for it ( and deserved to win ).",1
Another great Canadian invention. The five of them find themselves in all sorts of odd predicaments.,1
"Really funny stuff. There's plenty of violence, sex, and bad language ( so it would never make its way to U. S. Network TV ). Remember Greg the Bunny? My cousin and I thought it was pretty funny, beyond the precocious idea of puppets taking on TV - PG material.",1
Other interviewees include George Eastman and Al Cliver.,1
"But, I can't complain. Highly recommended for fans of D'amato. May he rest in peace. I was very excited to see a documentary on one of my favorite Italian directors. This documentary is a lenghty and informative guide to the films of D'Amato.",1
"< br / > < br / > RIP, Joe. It is great to see documentary dedicated to him and his fine, unique work. I suspect there are several cuts of this doco doing the rounds.",1
Mark Hamill is the documentary narrator.,1
I was really looking forward to watching this documentary on what I considered to be some of the most entertaining films ever made. Growing up in L. A. during the 60's many of these old black and white films were shown on the local stations. < br / > < br / > That is not what I was hoping for in this documentary.,1
"Yes, it turns into a commercial for the tepid remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS during the last fifteen minutes ; you can turn that off.",1
Trilogies are very interesting. What if Irene were born 40 years ago?,1
"The bond between these "" brothers "" may very well originated from an unconscious gay tendency inside these boys.",1
I'm totally agree with GarryJohal from Singapore's comments about this film. I was just a little sad to know that this film got about 20 cuts in censorship. What waste!,1
The actors are outstanding.,1
Well the truth is most of us can and do do that all the time. Yes non - Singaporean's can't see what's the big deal about this film.,1
The chasers war on everything is an excellent Australian comedy. ABC. The Chasers War On Everything. au / chaser. 5 words that I love to watch.,1
< br / > < br / > I would rate it 10 / 10.,1
The Chaser boys will go there. ! But CNNNN was just as funny.,1
"< br / > < br / > All in all, well done to the ABC for showing this and i recommend it highly. Even the most cynical and intellectual viewer won't be disappointed, and the show deserves ten stars.",1
A very funny look at some of Australia's current affairs and political goings - on.,1
everyone is a genius in something.,1
"One of the views is from Auguste's flat, the other is from Valentiné's flat across the street. This is incorrect.",1
and straight away. it'funny. This show is non Stop hilarity. I'm hooked. Any Australians Who Don't Find This Funny. Don't Complain And don't Watch it.,1
I remember listening to them on Triple J's afternoon show. ! Biting political and social satire at it's best.,1
Keep an eye out for the Crazy Wharehouse Guy or Mr Ten Questions. ! Good on ABC for supporting these guys.,1
Overall I rate thin show 98 %.,1
"He got thirty dollars in twenty minutes! < br / > < br / > A particularly funny segment is "" Mr. Two thumbs up! ) Opposition Leader ) threaten to kneecap them.",1
< br / > < br / > Go the CHASER!!! ! BE FUNNY!!!!,1
John Cusack and Paul Newman are excellent as always.,1
For instance - is the judge meant to be God or some supreme being?,1
"If you are not a fan, then they are Satan's team!! I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada - - particularly in Quebec. Very clever and memorable.",1
I enjoyed it.,1

"Wisdom doesn't bestow temporal power. nuclear weapons development and deployment. ), the NBC produced ENOLA GAY ( probably A LOT closer to the mark ), and the BBC - TV series, OPPENHEIMER, with Sam Waterston in the title role.",1
"This film is not, however, one of the best examples of turning a true story into a movie.",1
"J. Robert Oppenheimer in life was a complex man who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy. How these came to be and came to be in American hands is the story of this film. The challenge of the problem also intrigues him. < br / > < br / > The terms by the way are the code names of two bombs fueled with plutonium and uranium. So be it, Newman is determined to make his contribution to the war effort count. Groves is a military man first and foremost with an engineering background.",1
"Characters are constantly torn between that reality and their wartime duty as Americans. Sequestered in a heavily - guarded New Mexico compound, the brainiacs slowly turn the idea from ambitious concept into immense reality. The performances deserve special mention as well. Dwight Schultz as leader of the scientific team struggles with his affections for his family and his relentless obsession with his big project. < br / > < br / > Still, it's difficult not to recommend FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY. It was a fascinating story waiting to be told.",1
The use of music is particularly excellent in the last third of the movie.,1
"Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. One night after declining a pass made by her coworker, she hits a dog named Rita. She becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often, often becoming part of his eavesdropping games.

"This was a very funny, fast paced movie. Reminiscent, say, of the Mexican comedies of Cantinflas. Please direct me.",1
"Having now watched it twice, I recommend it as good entertainment.",1
My favourite film is Once upon a time in America. < br / > < br / > Long live Joe D'Aamto - Master of Porn androtica!,1
"In all honesty, Gore fans will probably fast forward through the hardcore sex. Out of two I find Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead far superior. The film is worth watching for laughs and to complete your D'Amato film quest. Porno Holocaust is extremely low budget as expected. But, don't bother watching either if they are cut. Only from D'Amato. The film is set on a beautiful tropical island.",1
"I find it at once naturalistic and exotic, and that doesn't just mean there is a black girl and some limp penises! Sure enough the storyline and dialogue are codswallop, but this is so beautifully filmed in such a marvellous setting and I actually like the hardcore. The creature does not deign to appear until half hour before the end and is, it has to be said, a disappointment. Much derided by all I rather like this movie.",1
"If so give me an e - mail or personal message.

"< br / > < br / > This is a true gem and very worth seeking out. It's historically accurate, however. George Tobias, Ben Blue and Alan Hale lend good support.

"We then see Michael and his Girl watching this horror film in the cinema, she is scared and walks out, and Michael soon follows her, singing the iconic song. Very good! He was, and will forever be one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry, and he will be missed terribly. The film ends with him taking her home, and looking at us with evil eyes.",1
It is brilliant to watch and the dance is fantastic. and vincent price's rap adds to the fear when all the zombies a rising from their graves. watch it.,1
IT'S THRILLER!!!! !,1
"Red is my favorite of these films, and I give it a 9. They are each well worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best seen as one work.",1
< br / > < br / > It's difficult to quite put my finger on why'Thriller'is considered one of the greatest of all music videos.,1
I am not a big music video fan. It was a movie. Folks go to Youtube. Simply wonderful. This was spectacular. Brilliant!,1
"< br / > < br / > I like Vincent Price's soliloquy. It's freaky. As for the video, it is awesome, one of Michael's best, but also very eccentric and weird. There are great sceneries and settings.",1
"When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before. Still, Thriller is great fun, and absolute must on Halloween. It has continued to be a problem in the age of MTV. Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song? Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh viewing of Thriller will reveal its faults.",1
"Jackson, the most popular artist on the planet, was still willing to show that the fixed image of a star contained multitudes, not all of them reassuring. Of course, she is on a date, and she is less scared by the film than what she knows will be expected by her boyfriend. The film opens in a cinema, with Jackson's girlfriend uncomfortable with the imagery, and the aggressively gendered response. < br / > < br / > This is brilliant, disturbing stuff, the best thing director Landis has ever done.",1
"He chases her through the forest, catches her and we... cut to a movie theatre. ""... then end credits. Extravagant, much? < br / > < br / > So, we're five minutes in and still no sign of song "" Thriller "".",1
"He begins to tell her that he is "" different. "" As they exit the theater, he begins to tease her. Inside the theater are Michael and his girlfriend. I give it a 10 / 10. You don't want to miss it! Yep, he becomes one of the undead. This scene shows Michael's skill with the camera. < br / > < br / > This is my favorite music video of all time!",1
"I give it a 5 5. Because of the dancing, comedy, storyline, and yes horror.",1
"This is one of them. I especially love Vincent Price's cameo as the narrator. 's music, you need to see this video at least once. J.",1
"In Red, imagery is paramount, as well as the obvious but clever color coding.",1
"On the way they encounter zombies announced by the immortal Vincent Price. Then, they do a little dance. After twenty years it remains the premier music video.",1
"If you don't think so, now, remember : Halloween is coming. Also the most expensive at the time, but every penny and every bit of the talent behind its creation and execution is up there on the screen. The stars and the planets must've all been in just the proper alignment, the day that THRILLER was conceived.",1
"The documentary has some "" interesting "" stuff in it. There hasn't been another one like it. A cool video to a song that everybody in the neighborhood marked out to.",1
"Michael follows. ( 5 / 5 ) It doesn't appear rushed at all, nor too long. < br / > < br / > Overall : Watch it, seriously.",1
It shows Michael turning into a zombie and dancing in the street with some spectacular choreography. ! Michael Jackson is amazing.,1

"Michael and his date then walk down a foggy street, and he teases her with the opening verses of Thriller. < br / > < br / > Michael and his date, Ola Ray, run out of gas in a dark, wooded area. Michael smiles but his date is frightened, and tells him she's leaving. Michael and the undead perform an elaborate song and dance number together, followed by the chorus of Thriller. A full moon appears, and Michael begins convulsing in agony transforming into a horrifying werewolf! She accepts and he gives her a ring. I even performed it for an audience 3 times!",1
"Kerwin and Norris are really excellent in this film. Contact, Men in Black I & 2, Stephen King's Dreamcatcher, Xtro 3 : Watch the Skies, Battlefield Earth : A Saga for the year 3000, Stargate, The Puppet Funny seeing them in another alien flick! The movie is filmed very good. The other being the classic violent epic Total Recall!",1
I've seen this movie more than once. I especially like Elizabeth Pena. See it for yourself and judge it for yourself.,1
"< br / > < br / > Valentine ( Irene Jacob ) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Used here as another protagonist, it brings a unmatched depth to the movie. A masterpiece! Disgusted by him she cannot go away and they meet again.",1
"Robert Mitchim and Robert Young also play leading roles. The real Robert Ryan was no Monty. < br / > < br / > Monty is a sadist in winning soldier's clothing. He WAS great, if underestimated, under used actor. Film noir at its best. Monty doesn't like people like that.",1
What really outrages Montgomery more then anything else about Samuels is that he's obviously Jewish. Whom he obviously feels threatened by. < br / > < br / > Samules Inviting Mitchell to join him and his lady friend Miss.,1
What a fine film! 2.,1
"But Mitchell is a gentle soldier, who is only missing his wife. < br / > < br / > Ryan is superb as Monty, the psychotic racist.",1
"What more can you expect from a top - notch movie? Might I add that noir is here used for its stylishness, and I might add financial advantages.",1
"Robert Young is fantastic as Capt. Finlay, the leading investigator of the murder case. Unlike other mystery thrillers, the audience is alerted to who the perpetrator is almost immediately.",1
< br / > < br / > Tho Crossfire A man by the name of Joseph Samuels is found brutally murdered in his apartment.,1
Grahame has a brief but effective role as a femme fatale. Future Tarzan Barker has a bit part as a soldier.,1
"Robert Young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. "" < br / > < br / > Truly excellent, and a must see. The big performance in the film belongs to Robert Ryan, but everyone is excellent.",1
"Loved this movie. In July 1947, RKO screened Crossfire for representatives of various Los Angeles religious groups. In September 1947, Crossfire was named Best Social Film at Cannes. While RKO was producing Crossfire, Twentieth Century - Fox was making Gentleman's Agreement, another story about antisemitism.",1
"You must think as you watch. See Three Colors : Blue and Three Colors : White. This is not a mindless, vicarious experience. Red is a fantastic film. But, watch it again. Everything is not explained to you.",1
All these points just seem to underline the deeply entrenched and intractable nature of the whole problem of bigotry as depicted in this movie. < br / > < br / > Keeley helps Michell to avoid being arrested and tries to identify the murderer.,1
"The man he kills did him no harm, and was in fact a stranger to him. The murderer, Monty, is one such individual. In America it was the high noon, or more properly, high midnight, of film noir. He is a lone wolf who also needs people.",1
This was a very gritty movie about anti - semitism.,1
As if this fool has any business judging his betters. There weren't any bars where a GI could pick up a pretty blonde. Put a sock in it! NONE! I've only seen this done in a few films. RKO Radio Pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even managed to get it nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. But these little things take nothing away from this classic.,1
"The story on which the film is based is about the killing of a gay man. Mitchum's part was as a sergeant and friend of original suspect in the case, George Cooper. It becomes just a question of getting the evidence. < br / Though he lost to Edmund Gwenn, the film was Ryan's breakthrough role. And it becomes clear to Young and Mitchum that Ryan is the guilty party almost as fast as it does to the audience.",1
"A credit to all involved. ##rilliant thriller, deserving far more fame, Mitchum and Ryan are awesome in their starring roles, as is the entire supporting cast.",1
"Robert Mitchum plays a cool Sgt. < br / > < br / > Richard Brooks novel was about the killing of a gay soldier. The parallels are well drawn. < br / > < br / > The basis of the murder is prejudice, pure and simple. Sam Levene is excellent in his small role of Samuels. Edward Dmytryk's "" Crossfire "" is a rare film coming from the Hollywood of the 1940s. Keeley who is deeply touched by the crime when one of his men is accused of committing it.",1
"Edmard Dmytryk's near - perfect direction, John Paxton's terse script and J. Roy Hunt's expert Expressionist lighting are wonderfully abetted by a superb ensemble cast.",1
"Just take a look at a shot of characters on a stairwell, the bars silhouetted against them, and see what I mean. A film like Crossfire puts another film that spreads around its social consciousness - i. e. the recent film Crash - almost to shame. And what would a noir be then without some attitude to go along with it?",1
But the lasting impression is of Robert Ryan's excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row. It's much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical.,1
"9 / 10 on my personal scale. And what a film! < br / > < br / > A great film. They deserve it. Seeing it again probably adds, and I am happy to have it recorded on tape.",1
"( And he does. ) There's also a civics lecture halfway through the movie that slows the proceedings to a crawl, and ending is tidy enough for a cop show. We don't see his attacker. But its real subject is the difficulty that WWII soldiers, as trained killers, were having as they made the transition to civilian life. ) And the cast is excellent. ( For a more genteel take on this topic, try "" The Best Years Of Our Lives. "" Robert Mitchum is onhand as a soldier friend of the accused killer. And Robert Young, as the detective assigned to the murder, is surprisingly gritty Still, what a great noir it could have been. A man is beaten to death in the first few frames of the film. But otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery. """,1
"Haven't seen her in two years. Indeed, she is - I guess it's "" Hey, soldiers will be soldiers "". Do I care? I've done this too long, I guess. "" Then he says, "" No that's a lie, No. He says "" I'm just a man like you, interested in "" whore. < br / > < br / > A man shows up at the whore's apartment. For six years, American movies had shown American soldiers as everybody's son, brother, father.",1
"< br / > < br / > "" Crossfire "" is considered to be one of the best of the "" film noire "" genre. It was made on a modest budget in about three weeks. He enlists Sgt. In fact it garnered several Academy Award nominations including Ryan and Grahame for best supporting actors. Peter Keeley ( Robert Mitchum ) to help him locate Mitchell. Unexpectedly a man ( Paul Kelly ) turns up looking for Ginny.",1
"And < br / > < br / > You might need a second look to fully catch the plot as it is explained ( too much ) or shown in flashback ( also too much ) because it's a little complicated without good reason. Mitchum mostly plays a watered down version of what he is famous for, and the fourth known acting force, Gloria Grahame, is a great, brief, presence even if slightly dispensable. But it makes sense overall, and we see early on ( too early probably ) who the culprit is, and even why. The shell - shocked soldier rendered helpless ( but still intrinsically capable ), the modest youngster without confidence ( but capable, too ), and the weary but outwardly able veteran are all there. That's reason enough to watch it once and even twice.",1
"Consider 1947. The guy does a splendid job. Not even anti - Semitism has been treated on screen yet. So we can hardly blame the makers of this film for not leaving the victim a homosexual. That scowl, that penetrating stare, those dark eyes glittering. But, okay, you have to go with the flow. Wow.",1
"But this was 1947. Very atmospheric too. That said, it's still a very good film.",1
"Definitely a "" must see "" for all fans of film noir. < br / > < br / > Another low budget gem from the Hollywood archives.",1
"As late as 1947, it was a big deal for a movie to announce that anti - Semitism existed, and that it was bad. Samuels is beaten to death, and Mitchell disappears, making himself the prime suspect for the killing. As a rule, there are few things more dispiriting than Hollywood's attempts to be courageous.",1
"With Sam Levene as the murder victim. Without him, the movie would be commonplace.",1
"Suspicion falls on the second of the three ( George Cooper ), who has vanished. Ryan slays the third buddy ( Steve Brodie ) to insure his silence before Young closes in. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale.",1
"Such a quality, or vibe usually seems unintentional. Also, this isn't quite the brand of B - horror I was expecting, considering the title and all. Although not all that scary, considering it's about a killer bed, Death Bed possesses the qualities that make for successful horror. Never has the words "" hidden gem "" been so accurate.",1
"If you're looking for overt gore or rabid action, "" Death Bed : The Bed That Eats "" isn't the flick for you. "" Death Bed "" is a gentler, weirder drive - in picture ; it plays like an utterly strange dream, half - remembered.",1
"There are few cinematic equivalents to this disturbing yet often humorous lesson in mythology, morality and surrealist ideology. < br / > < br / > DEATH BED has many recognizable elements of the < br / > < br / > past, but displays a wholly unique and original storyline.",1
"An evil bed. If you like bizarre no - budget, oddball flick than definitely seek out "" Death Bed "". It eats people.",1
A weird prank being pulled on the audience? I'm not making this up. See it... but you've been warned. < br / > < br / > - Is this a horror comedy? This truly beggars description.,1
It's a truly strange and unconventional horror flick.,1
"I won't spoil them for you, but they're a nice touch. Death bed : The bed that eats. < br / > < br / > The effects are fine. If you are easilypooked, don't watch this movie.",1
"Consider it like existential camp. A LOT of movies. I watch a lot of movies. Its hard to be cinephile and consistently stay engaged. The worst horror villain of all time? From what it is to how its put together. < br / > < br / > The rhythm of the piece is psychotic. And yeah, copping to liking this will open you up to ridicule.",1
"I do love B - horror films. I HAD to rate this so highly simply because Death Bed : the bed that eats, is so one of a kind, and so original. totally fantastic.",1
"In BLUE, Juliette Binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected. In WHITE, an act of cruelty spawns an unlikely friendship between two men who will, against the odds, conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and full circle.",1
"Yes, Beardsley would sound like that. < br / > < br / > Find this film and bathe in it.",1
8 out 10.,1
"George Barry is a genius. "" Available from FAB Press. Hyper - strange acting, subtly nightmarish atmosphere.",1
The film features three young women who come across the mansion which holds the basement containing the death bed. The bed consumes the blood and it's hunger remains.. anything that comes in contact with the bed is consumed!,1
"See it for yourself. Hmmmm. Imagine Bunel crossed with Bergman, then left to soak in a big vat of Herschell Gordon Lewis. < br / > < br / > Plot? I'm kinda at a loss here.",1
"Well, for starters, obviously there is a bed that eats. 8 out of 10 stars. And how do I even begin to describe this?",1
"Not only does it eat people, but it cleans up after itself, draws the covers back, and it even makes itself. No sirree Bob! Who wouldn't want a bed like that? ).",1
"it's worth it. < br / > < br / > I'm a huge fan of B movies. It has a great premise, A bed... That eat's people. It's really rather Simple. If you laughed or smiled, Then give it a go.",1
!,1
Truly a cult classic.,1
I only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family.,1
This is a truly unique film. - - you are correct. This film is on my top 20 comedies list. Glover is clearly the best comic actor working right now.,1
"Howdy has Crispin Glover is predictably magnificent as Howdy : as always, he remains perfectly in character.",1
"this much is certain. it's well acted and fairly fast paced. it is based on the book written by Mark Fuhrman. also, one may argue that the ending was abrupt and again one would be right. either way, it makes for an interesting movie. this is a TV movie based on the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich in the mid 1970's.",1
! Watch movie!,1
"Or "" Do I care?",1
Two thumbs way up. I thought this movie was excellent. You Have Been Warned!,1

I'd definitely recommend watching this.,1
He was very good but he could have played this part with his eyes shut. I saw this film purely by chance.,1
"I'll keep hoping! Yes, it is a bit cheesy.",1
"This episode, though, does refer to and is based on the "" Naked Time "" original series one. The plot is very believable. < br / > < br / > Now, to the Firth Missile.",1
"It's not really meant for children although nothing happens that would upset them. < br / > < br / > Some familiarity with Japanese history and theatrical traditions will help with the enjoyment of this film. Much as familiarity with Shakespeare's "" The Tempest "" would help with Peter Greenaway's dense "" Prospero's Books "". Special effects and computer graphics certain made this sort of production easier to achieve than the old film matte technology would have. If last third was better I would have given it nine stars.",1
"I've not laughed out loud so much at this type of film since Ken Russell's outrageous musical deconstruction in "" The Boyfriend "". < br / > < br / > The laughter comes from the film's consummate mixture of parodies in contemporary style.",1
"One hilarious thing I'll say off the top, is I'm not the biggest Seisun Suzuki fan. Boy!",1
"Sherlock Holmes films from the classic Universal era tend to range in quality. Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon fits snugly into the middle ground quality - wise, and, as ever, it's an enjoyable outing that fans of the series, like myself, will enjoy very much. It'good to see Holmes'nemesis, Professor Moriarty return, even if it does seem like he's just been thrown in for the hell of it. Perhaps Universal saw what brought down the earlier Voice of Terror and changed the focus because of that. His scene with Watson in a car following paint drops on the road is my favourite moment of the film.",1
"It was not their first Sherlock Holmes adventure, as they did one a couple of years before this. They always seem to dash on when they find a new clue.",1
"The man she describes is Professor Moriarty. He sees it's code. He is working for the Nazi's. He sees it's the name of four scientists. He has a bomb sight that could win the Second World War. Holmes visits the young lady Tobell was with the night he was attacked. Then Holmes's greatest fear happens, Tobell goes missing. The drawings have been stolen. Seen as he has the drawings, Holmes is done for.",1

"The movie itself is ancient kiddie matinée fare, but it benefits from director Roy William Neill's attention to staging and atmosphere.",1
But Moriarty wants to get hold of it so he can sell them to the Nazis. ).,1
I thought he was this superb scientist trying to save England? Leaving the secret bomb parts with genius scientists. ? Now there are a few flaws in this film I thought I might point out. And isn ' He was endangering them all. Basil Rathbone on the other hand is exceptional in this entry. Like what was he thinking?,1
"Slightly over - the - top patriotic message as the credits roll. < br / > < br / > Watched on DVD, part of the "" 50 Mystery Classics "" set from Mill Creek Entertainment. A climax in Moriarty's dockside lair is suitably exciting, and we can all guess that all ends well, can't we? I liked this probably slightly more than Terror by Night though not enough to give it the extra *.",1
"The only clue left by Tobel is a list of "" dancing men. "" Watch and enjoy.",1
"99 DVD Copy! ) This is a great late night movie! It could be the espionage, code cracking and WW II theme.",1
"If they needed to call in Holmes, so be it. There is a concluding speech that is almost a parody of itself. The plot is complex enough to keep ones interest.",1
The sparring between Holmes and Moriraty is colorful and well thought out to boot.,1
"Sherlock Holmes really served his purpose. Once the man reaches England, however, his troubles are just beginning. This is an effective Holmes story, set in the atmosphere of Switzerland and blackout England. The series worked just fine in the present day.",1
"< br / > < br / > Moriarty appears in three of the Holmes films with Rathbone. Next comes Mr. Atwill's performance here - more of that later. They keep him from completing the main plan. It's typically cool, classy performance by Mr. Daniell, but his confrontations with Holmes seem to be a tedious bore to him.",1
But more important this is a great film. ! The script and the photography ( colour / light etc ) is wonderful.,1
"The script and direction both make this entry more of cat and mouse game between the two characters and that is one of the reasons this entry succeeds so well. Great job on the cinematography as well. Very good entry in the Holmes series with plenty of mystery and guesswork to go about. Rating, 8.",1
"< br / > < br / > It's a rather fantastic story from start to finish, just how many McGuffin's are there?",1
"The film starts in Switzerland where Holmes saves from the Nazis to an inventor of a bomb - sight, named Dr. Tobel ( Post ). Back in London, Tobel hand over four parts of the device to diverse scientist. He's the perfect counterpoint of Holmes. Both stories are completely patriotic and flag - waging movies. In the film appear the habituals from Holmes series. Sherlock must to solve his disappearance and some vitally important.",1

"Makes Watson look like a genius. Still, he does grow on you ( in a way ). < br / > < br / > Still, worth catching if just for Rathbone and Atwill. He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. You seriously wonder why Holmes puts up with him. Arguably he is the BEST Sherlock Holmes ever put on the screen. ).",1

Oooooh man was I pleased I didn't miss this. its gem! It pays true homage to the game DOOM.,1
I'm not sure I even want to see what happens next! This is not a family friendly episode. This is far scarier than any amount of flying Daleks.,1
To do this complaining would be to deny the magic of DOCTOR WHO. It happened previously during Eccleston's finale and it happened watching this episode. The Doctor and Rose lose the Tardis and they're stuck with protagonists in the far flung future. It is DOCTOR WHO at its most traditional best. Even an old cynical DOCTOR WHO fan like myself can be left breathless by watching an episode of my favourite show. They do this by constructing a doom laden narrative.,1
I myself am guilty of that already.,1
Its so funny and lovable. She gets in. She is a good actress.,1
"They are actors, not soccer players. It was GREAT. I found myself laughing a lot in this movie.",1
And Channing is going to be a huge star. I love this movie. Amanda has never been funnier.,1

! Amanda Bynes's just crazily amazing!,1
Meanwhile Frank has raised the ire of her disapproving English tutor ( Sam Neill ).,1
You just watch it. Movie is really great. The whole atmosphere that was created.,1
This was a fantastically written screenplay when it comes to perceiving things from another perspective.,1

"first of all, i don't understand how she wanted to try for the boys team? or was shooting her only problem? it was like this was the only team they know...! !",1
"Amanda was a great actor in the movie, her comedic timing was perfect. The guy who played Duke was hot, plain and simple.",1
so you have to. It rocks and you have to watch it. !,1
Nearly every scene nails the comedic set - up. My anticipation was not disappointed.,1
"He also does a good job with some of the film's tougher scenes. If you like the Bynes, you will like this film. Too me, it's as simple as that.",1
"( lo ) so much so that I might just get it on DVD. ! Plus too Amanda Baynes last movie was not so hot, making me doubt the movie for she is the lead actress.",1
Shes the man is great.,1
"Three men and a woman are making a porn film. The Japanese have probably the most sadistic movies around the world, and this is one of the strongest examples. He is knocked unconscious too and has his penis cut off. After hearing a lot about this film, I was very happy when I finally found it.",1
It is definite guarantee. The only way of pulling it off is through this movie.,1
"It is Antonio. Shakespeare was inspired by others. In the movie, she has been dumped. I think he'd give a thumbs - up.",1
"You also see her room - mate, Duke's ( Channing Tatum ), impression of this. It was also more of a chick flick than I expected but it was good. It pulls you into a whole bunch of crazy love stories and lies. It was very funny. I think this movie will be the big break for many raising stars.",1
"Go and see it! She was amazing, really funny & is still stunning!",1
"But after seeing this, I was quite surprised. What a contrasting role between those two movies! ).",1
"Adults and teens alike would over all enjoy this movie. : D Well, it's true!",1
The strong superstructure of its plot is upheld by the art of Shakespeare.,1
"The other actors also do a swell job, in many of their first time debut.",1
This movie is this years Mean Girls.,1
""", but that's all part of the fun. < br / > < br / > Overall, just hilarious. In the end plot turned out pretty well. I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious.",1
"Now I must warn you, that if you are not into this stuff, you should stay far far away. This is indeed one of best fake snuff films I have ever seen, if not the best. And I mean, in a very sick way.",1
"She's probably one of the most talented comediennes out there. < br / > < br / > Amanda Bynes is a star!! But for the purpose of this film she is perfect!! Not entirely... but believable enough. Her style of physical comedy, impersonations, and witty dialect makes her hilarious.",1
"Everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish - all age groups.!!! It is super funny, witty and charming. ! Amanda Bynes is hiious and so was David Cross.",1
"And that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it... like alluding to Shakespeare. Beyond that, though, this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary / traditional teen flick. < br / > < br / > Wonderful entertainment from beginning to end... check it out! < br / > < br / > Aside from those names, the thematic commonalties ( a & b ) are really great themes for any script, and this movie's script is no exception. Cinematography was excellent.",1
She is so refreshing. The actors were perfectly cast.,1
"One of the film's lighter moments, but you get an idea how tense people can get when they're caught cheating. Same with the truck driver who's pressured by Johnny into signing for an accurate delivery ; he just wasn't used to doing that. < br / > < br / > I got a kick out of watching Cagney in this one. < br / > < br / > All in all, a nice diversion from Cagney's more typical gangster presence, even if not up to the standard of his feature films. He turns to the camera and hitches up as if entirely pleased with his response to the crook - very cool.",1
I have to say I really liked it.,1
We never know if he is really in danger.,1
"< br / > < br / > Although the plot sounds serious, the film is anything but. < br / > < br / > Good entertainment thoroughly enjoyable. This is done well by all throughout.",1
"Er, fly. Mae Clarke's presence lends a definite Warner's feel to the overall production. After all, four cents here and a quarter there add up and before we know it we have anarchy! Word of his intransigence soon reaches both the Mayor and the Governor's offices, and Cagney becomes a marked man.",1
If you like Cagney you'll like this film. Made in simpler times it reflects a world we can't find today.,1
"What ensues can be briefly described ( I'm not going to spoil everything for you ) as rape during dismemberment. And then... it starts to happen. Everything is shown, with no mercy for the viewer. SFX are very good, makeup too. They untie her. In end, girl breaks down and cries. Think of "" Flower of flesh and blood "", mix it with porn and you will get the idea. You have been warned.",1
"My favorite song of all time is now on that DVD. Other than that, it was exquisit. Trampled Underfoot. It's either that one or'In my time of dying '. Ever seen Randy Rhoads play?",1
And the video quality is even more impressive.,1
"< br / > < br / > In the Royal Albert Hall concert, for instance, the band had a lot of room to improvise. It is brilliant as always, even more so than the version on IV. < br / > < br / > After the Madison Performances, we are treated with Earl's Court. The following are performances that were supposed to be part of "" The Song Remains The Same "", but did not make the cut. Excellent riffs like those in the songs "" Black Dog "" and "" The Ocean "" were both present. < br / > < br / > Next, on DVD 2, is a promotional video for the Led Zeppelin III hit song "" Immigrant Song "".",1
It is SO wonderful. This DVD is a MUST HAVE!,1
"And if you disagree - watch the DVD. < br / > < br / > A quick breakdown. The first of the two DVD's is where the true magic is. Yup, I said it. So, I'd recommend the first disk to ANY music lover, and the second for the only true Zeppelin fan. Again, I have seen SO many bands perform, some small - some the current'masters. ( It's no secret that by this time he was severely addicted to heroin ).",1
"This two disc set is incredible! John Bonham is John Bonham, what can I say?",1
'Sick Again'- great piece of sleaze - rock. 'In the Evening'- I never liked this on disc but it zings along here. < br / > < br / > There's'White Summer'from 1970 - 10 minutes of guitar wizardry. Demonic possessions of rawk!! < br / > < br / > The magic continues into Knebworth 1979 section. < br / > < br / > Plant is amazing throughout all the performances.,1
It's absolutely spectacular! < br / > < br / > Viva Jimmy Page! Be on the lookout for the live jam'White Summer '... whe!,1
": ) < br / > < br / > Like I said - it's pseudo snuff movie. "" Sounds pretty sick, isn't it? And last one is a torture scene.",1
Long live Led Zeppelin.,1
"I am the proud converter of 2 or 3 Led Zeppelin fans and the only reason I was able to do this is because of this DVD. Held high by the followers and used as a converter for the unwashed heathens. and I was like, "" Oh yeah, watch this! "" My friend was like "" Led Zeppelin sucks! """,1
"I'm glad I did, though. All ten episodes are pretty good. "" The Perfect Day "" is also good.",1
"< br / > < br / > Meanwhile, all is not rosy with Leila'new marriage. De Mille. He takes his wife for granted. Leila tries to get him to straighten out to no avail. She invites Leila to her home for the weekend to make James "" miss her "".",1
The film gives the audience the advantage of watching Jim's transformation along with Leila. I loved this film. < br / > < br / > Definitely worth watching.,1
He was so into his work that he forgot their anniversary. Jim ends off making lots of money and cleaning himself up. He goes to her and tries to bring her home. He was also very sloppy.,1
But she finds her self almost comparing notes between her ex and her current husband. I found this movie to be filled with irony. You can not have true happiness with out yourself being truly happy.,1
"Ultimately, she divorces her hubby and marries the smooth - talking Romeo.",1
"Who will win? Soon, Swanson is drawn to Mr. Cody.",1
The tongue cutting scene really made me squirm. 8 out of 10.,1
It isn't pretty. Ouch!!!,1
"For example, when we are introduced to the character of Toodles, she is shown reflected three times in a dressing table mirror. Don't Change Your Husband is, on the one hand, the beginning of a series of lightweight marital comedies from Cecil B. DeMille. That attention - grabbing first shot of her helps us remember who she was.",1
"The events might not come as a total surprise, but it's such a modern love story, set almost a hundred years ago, it's a gas. And did I saw Swanson was perfect? < br / > < br / > If you are looking for visual or formal amazement, you won't find here. But as a story, well acted, and filmed with precision and economy, it's really a great example. ).",1
"After several confrontations and convenient meetings, things are resolved. To make matters worse she discovers Cody has a woman on the side ( Julia Faye ). Pure hokum but very entertaining, and Swanson looks great. Cody is also good as the fake charmer who is a liar and cheat. < br / > < br / > Swanson impresses me more every time I see her. She looks great and wears some stunning gowns. As he coos to her she imagines the scenes. She seems to have been such a natural actress and yet Sylvia Ashton plays Mrs. Huckney.",1
This is a near - perfect collection of short videos. They'great! < br / > < br / > Any fan of art films will love these. < br / > < br / > My rating : * * * * out of * * * *. 56 mins. What doesn't change is the quality of these videos. It's a great watching experience.,1
Check out this DVD and find out why.,1
This disc really deserves your attention. < br / > < br / > Kudos for top notch presentation.,1
Enjoy.,1
But that is just the beginning. As a bonus it even has Renaldo & the Loafs hauntingly beautiful'Songs for Swinging Larvae'and even features The Residents cover of it.,1
This movie is a gem of Japanese film - making. It appears that Japan is sinking due to a subduction of a tectonic plate to the west.,1
"As i said.... My hats off to Shinji Higuchi for directing it, i hope he can outdo his work with another mind blowing experience. Fantastic Film.",1
The movie is set in Madurai and Chennai and its story core is simple.,1
Excellent detail and storyline ( for a remake ). It's the best movie I've watched this year!,1
"Slain ', Maegi I don't know how much I missed but it wasn't much.",1
"Predjudicial visions are bitter and not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion. Dick you should watch it with a more open heart I am Canadian, born and raised. This how ever ran a different course. Oh and by the way, I am not Japanese, though in many ways I wish I was. This was a great movie in all aspects. I don't know what Dick steel was talking about, but I found this film to be one of Japan's most thrilling epics to date. I really hope Shinji Higuchi will make another of such films. In most cases this would simply be called tectonic shifting on steroids.",1
"The emotional element is underplayed, and it really works. < br / > < br / > Is Nihon chinbotsu credible?",1
"It's enough to make the reader dread hearing any news about earthquakes in Japan. Difference of opinions, I guess. Personally, I enjoyed it. And you know what? < br / > < br / > Frankly, I've been surprised by some of the negative comments made about this film.",1
"This made the "" exciting "" ending a bit of a drag for me. Another "" end of the world "" film that begs comparison to the abysmal "" Day After Tomorrow "". The sudden stopping of the film for a pop love song doesn't help either ( unless you like the song ). A few scenes touch on the chaos but for the most part this part of the story is barely touched on. That depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. Recommended. Acting is all good as well.",1
Though not a Greek I have had a lifelong interest in the Eastern Empire.,1
"The third and final video explains the decline and fall of Byzantium. Do, take time to watch. The second video deals with Byzantine diplomacy and the iconoclastic controversy.",1
"Again and again. This is yet another gem from the pen of Daniele Thompson - in fact that same year ( 1999 ) she wrote and directed La Buche, the first of three writer / director credits so far. Belle Maman is first of all'French'whatever that means which is, of course, different things to different folks.",1
I've only known her for her music ). I also liked the dancing scene in the men's room a lot!,1
wow. go watch it. Vijay rocks. its devastatingly hilarious. It is very deep.,1
Or at least you feel pretty high after this movie.,1
"but what do you expect from a family of lawyers? No, me either! )",1
!,1
"Those eyes, that smile. Well, yes, she is. < br / > < br / > The cinematography is wonderful. NOT TO BE MISSED! Loved the lesbian Mom. Let me tell you that it was well worth it. I don't speak a word of French. I found it on ebay. She really goes beyond beauty.",1
"Very good! Basically it starts with a happy upper - middle class family living in Victorian London. It was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Films.",1
"It's not long before he will play an important part in the story. The story, however, is about these three children, especially Bobbie. She begins to write stories to earn money. They find a poor man at the station who cannot speak English. Only their fortitude and good spirits are going to see them through. They insist he must come home with them, and their mother takes him in.",1
And as for the Kindly Gentleman. Something else is going on with that character.,1
In Victorian times a father is separated from his family when he is falsely accused of treason and they are sent to live in the country. < br / > < br / > Actors who direct movies are often not very good at it.,1
I love it. One of my top ten films.,1
"I confess I fell in love with Roberta in 1970, and she still touches me today.",1
"Vijay is as usual very good in role of the kabaddi player. The dialogue "" Hi Chellam "" has really caught on with masses. A special mention has to be made about the villain of the movie Prakashraj. Since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine.",1
This original manages to imprint itself in your memory.,1
< br / > < br / > Plus a quick plaudit for Bernard Cribbins.,1
But this is basically a movie about family.,1
"The ending is enough to have you in tears, as it is so beautifully done. Bethany Cox. In fact, I preferred Perks on film, as he isn't as humorous in the book. The children were perfect. 10 / 10.",1
"( I'm not old, I'm 19 ) It's brill.",1
"Somewhat surprisingly, it seems to retain a significant appeal for today's children a hundred years later. < br / > < br / > Spo Unlike most films of children's books,'The Railway Children'may appeal more to adults than to children.",1
I'm a 41 year old bke ).,1
that precedes sudden child - felt changes in fortune. This is a film that I love above all others. !,1
Tamil version is much fast paced than Telugu.,1
"If we had more films of this nature, the world would become better place.",1
"Jenny Agutter plays Bobbie, while Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren are her sister and brother. ).",1
"< br / > < br / > I hope that, as generations pass, children will still be able to enjoy this film. This wonderful film has never failed to move me. Not to mention certain adults! Their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable. Consider the foul - mouthed celebrities who now "" grace "" our TV screens.",1
'wrenches emotion from the viewer. My Daddy!,1
"7 / 10 You do get nice candid shots of the people, crew and actors alike. This is well - done, with tight editing. There are documentaries that go into more detail, and cover the other two groups better. It gets into the technology some, and reveals how certain effects were achieved.",1
"and that's just the tip of the iceberg. you won't regret. if you are a real fan of the matrix, you have to see this documentary. Long trailer?",1
This was just the thing. I found only one problem with it. I am salivating for the sequels. < br / > < br / > There is no spoon. It is what all Matrix fans who are going nuts need to keep them quiet. ).,1
What could ever happen in a dull Texan town in summer?,1
I saw the movie in Izmir as the closing film of Izmir film festival. ( I'm a film critic! ),1
So to speak. ) There are films that make careers.,1
"Ghillie a remake of the Telugu "" okkadu'is thankfully a clarified version of the original. The role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble. Trisha became my personal favorite after this movie. I give it a clear 8 out of 10. Prakash Raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter - weight for Vijay's role. Vijay fits as a'T'into the role and essays a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next door.",1
"Man, I really enjoyed this, if only for Fred Willard's commentary at the dog show.",1
"Which makes this film absolutely hsyterical. * * * * * / * * * * * Just a storyboard. Parker Posey shine and is absolutely great! First of all, I should not this film had no script.",1
"First viewing I thought it was funny. However, my wife * hated * it.",1
Oh and the commentator is hiious!,1
I loved the dogs too! A very long time.,1
"Plus the dogs are cute too. "" Best in Show "" isn't exactly the laugh riot that I expected, but there are laughs and it's worth seeing.",1
I don't resile from that opinion.,1
Perfect. His friends to fill in the comedy quota. Am an ardent Vijay fan.,1
Such dead satire is rare indeed. I can hardly wait for his next film.,1
Thank you Mr.,1
"Thank you, Christopher Guest! How they do it?",1
< br / > < br / > Well worth watching - even if cats are more your bag.,1
High recommended!,1
"However, it was the dogs who eventually stole the show. This film isn't a comedy, its an expose.",1
Little action. Well done.,1
BEST IN SHOW : 5 / 5. He has a gift for humor. This has got to be the funniest movie I have seen in forever. Someone born without a personality would laugh at this film. It is funny - dumb. I almost died laughing. Chritopher Guest is truly talented.,1
"The Swan's who have taken far too much coffee and scream at each other. Funny scenes include the'Look at me! 'scene, and any with Levy.",1
"< br / > < br / > I give it a 10 / 10, one of the best I have seen.",1
"< br / > < br / > By the way, try to find this on DVD as the extras were actually worth seeing. < br / > < br / > The film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular. However, none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world. I also loved the openly gay couple, as they were terribly funny and clever. Clever and consistently funny. Exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade.",1
He will forever be typecast as this character to me as he was so natural and didn't seem forced at any point. A great actor with razor like wit. It is a film that grows on you. This movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history. The first time I saw it I thought it was serviceable but not overly hilarious.,1
This humor is not for everyone. What a fun bunch they must be.,1
They sure look neat.,1
"< br / > < br / > I imagine the golden days of Second City were like this. < br / > < br / > It's a well - shot film, but what makes it extraordinary is the acting. This is the funniest movie I have ever seen.",1
"It was just great and fun to watch Gerry's looks. It'a great movie is just fun to watch, I'd highly recommend it! This whole movie is just a hoot, and you can't stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up.",1
"That's really all there is to it, but that makes it funny enough. The owners truly are characters, as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs. If you like Guest's stuff at all, you should definitely own this one. I guess there's a freedom in having such a minimal plot. I actually encounter wierdos like this now and then.",1
One of the few humorous movies I can watch again and again.,1
"His idea is simple : make your comedy not just funny, but SMART funny. For shame, critics, for shame times two! And... do I have to tell you the rest? Best in Show "" is, without a doubt, the best comedy of 2000.",1
This was Waldo'last Our Gang short. Spanky tries many ways to make him thirsty. Here Waldo is selling lemonade but isn't making any money. It also made me laugh. ( I believe they sing that to make Froggy thirsty. ).,1
Jason's english paper is stolen by Wolf and begins the adventure along with kaylee to earn his father's trust back. They fly to Hollywood in search of Wolf to get him back. The unemployed critic isn't unemployed for nothing. One day Jason is hit by Mr. Wolf ( the big bad director ). I have to admit that I absolutely loved this movie.,1
"Just a brilliant play about many things, foremost being euthanasia, "" respectability "", religion, and fundamental human relationships. Another masterpiece that needs a DVD release but some libraries have the VHS and well worth seeking out. He's had kind of a spotty filmography ( "" The Krays "" was another highlight ), but these two gems will mark him as great director.",1
"We can safely say that he will be sadly missed. At one point, they even consider euthanasia.",1
< br / > < br / > I don't think Alan Bates has done a better film than this. Its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknown. < br / > < br / > Its never shown on television.,1
This one mainly works as a way to pass time.,1
Tweety and Sylvester are domestic pets who are being sent unattended across country by train. Friz Freleng's'All Abir - r - r - d'is one of the best Sylvester and Tweety cartoons.,1
"One of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train. The engine has either the number 651 or 814, or none at all.",1
"And the chase is on. Of course there's a bulldog too, and silly Sly just cant keep his big mouth shut.",1
"Sylvester puts his halo on and looks innocent. Yeah, right. Tweety is sent in his cage on a train by his old - lady owner. The cat gets mouthy with him, and pays a big price in an extremely funny manner. He puts Tweety "" in a safer place, "" up high and tells the cat, "" Now, remember : no tricks! """,1

"Repeat it then get it out on DVD. Do the decent thing thing. This can't be right for a film that has got to be the funniest thing I have ever seen. < br / > < br / > Come on ITV, there are still some of us out there who would like to watch original, quality comedy / drama.",1

? George Best? Never!,1
PLEASE CONSIDER ONE OFHOSE! I saw this back in 99 and I remember loving it.,1
How does he do it?,1
The possible weakness here is Thompson's laid - back direction. The lovely Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence. But the film floats because of actors and the script.,1
"The girl's got the gift. Loved seeing Jaleel White able to mock himself. < br / > < br / > All in all, great movie. < br / > < br / > Amanda Bynes. < br / > < br / > Paul Giamatti is a very talented man. What more can I say? So he gets his best friend Kaylee ( Bynes ) and they go and drive the Wolf crazy.",1

"< br / > < br / > The "" KIng Lear "" scene was, at the time, quite a milestone in schlock "" You cruel bastards.. My * * * *!! "" It was unique and awesome. Watch it and remember that until this burst onto the western screens, there was no genre for it to slot into. We loved the sickening violence, the anguish, the testosterone. Delightful. Gorgeous without being opulent and with the most brilliant fight choreography ever to grace a screen.",1
"< br / > < br / > There is a lot to this story. Luckily, the movie recovered quickly with a fight scene.",1
As does most movies of the genre.,1
"Unfortunately, the theater where I saw this was torn down. It never happened. This movie was the 2nd. in a double feature. ), nonetheless, it's classic kung - fu action wonderfully planned & executed.",1
"Certainly not. < br / > < br / > So is the film now only of historical value? And though Shaw Bros. films had borrowed from the Japanese chambara ( swordfight ) genre before, none had done so with such success as this one.",1
Well worth seeing for kung fu fans!,1
You'll enjoy the experience much more. Very good film. Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film. Enough good humor to keep adults interested. Who said it had to be believable?,1
"The movie, with its terrible dubbing, explosive ( if not highly improbable ) action sequences and technical flaws and all, has a plot, albeit a very thin one. < br / > < br / > But what is all the hoopla about regarding "" Five Fingers of Death ""? Before you know it, a major setback threatens Chih - Hao's training, and his ability to represent his beloved school in the upcoming tournament.",1
"< br / > < br / > The music was superb as well. I really loved this character. < br / > < br / > The main guy played by Lo Lieh actually stands out amongst karate film heroes. When the light shines on Chi Hao's hands as he does the Iron Fist, its pure beauty.",1
You can't ask for more than that.,1
).,1
This is my favourite kung fu movie.,1
"I recently bought it on DVD and watched it again. I was greatly entertained the second time, too. You are very bad guy! """,1
This is truly a kung fu classic.,1
"Some films can pass test of time but the dubbed version of FFoD can't. The mostly Chinese audience enjoyed this film immensely. I enjoyed it here too but for different reasons. The original "" King Boxer "" is still enjoyable... a CLASSIC! The crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. From the start, the movie made you laugh.",1
"Probably not. Is this the kind of film that hardcore action junkies will enjoy? Granted, it is not in the same vein as Under Siege, et.",1
"He has, as always, a very good charisma.",1
"Who's dummy? Everyone thinks they're a critic. If you don't like his work, don't watch it. < br / > < br / > I enjoyed the film.",1
"Watch it anyway for the fun of it. < br / > < br / > Basically, this is a very good film. If you're open to seeing Seagal without the action, it's well worth a look.",1
The few action scenes were very well made. Cammilla Belle was just incredible. So I was really surprised about this one. ).,1
This film is class pure and simple.,1
This movie has it all. I disagree. 3 ». And opening new horizons in his film career.,1
Recommended. Robert Young plays a lieutenant junior grade and Jimmy Durante as a cook. The safety of the ship and the mission must always come first.,1
"Okay - if you're looking for a movie showing a man boxing a kangaroo, this would be the one. Later Tommy gets himself into some real trouble when he disobeys orders in an effort save his buddy.",1
"One of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes. The dialog is highly entertaining, and Jimmy Durante is hilarious as the ship's cook, "" Ptomaine "".",1
It must have truly been hell below. Very similar to Sean McClory's in Island in the Sky. How much more so that must have been for the seamen during World War I. fill their roles quite nicely. It will haunt you long after you've seen this film. I guess there truly is a limit on situations as well.,1
"The movie's worth seeing for that moment alone, but even without it, it would be a first - rate early submarine drama.",1
"Sterling Holloway creates a brief, vivid, portrait of a doomed seaman. < br / > < br / > Robert Young makes an effective appearance as Montgomery's buddy.",1
Good movie - 3 stars out of 5.,1
There were some funny parts as well as action - packed drama. Travis Milloy has real talent as a writer and director. I will definitely watch it again!,1
It was way too melodramatic. The film doesn't necessarily take the position that things decayed.,1
< br > < br / > In one word : beautiful...,1
"This is a very long movie, indeed.",1
GRADE : B -,1
"And it is merely for the style it will be remembered about. Then, as in The Dreamers, the action moves in the Parisian flat where the heroes of the defeated revolt make art, smoke drugs, dream, and fall for one other. < br / > < br / > The story line seems also familiar. The effect is exquisite. And yet, LAR is a different film, and an interesting one. The movie starts with long scenes of the 1968'emeutes ', maybe among the best done until now. There is no direct social comment, no real explanation of the background of the revolt.",1
"8 / 10 Fantastic performances from the two leads and a great look to the film that gave it a real authentic feel. Unfortunately for him, he missed out on a film of tremendous beauty.",1
This is the best French movie of the year!,1
There are even Godard - like verfremdung - effects with the persons looking directly into the camera and even addressing Bernardo Bertolucci directly. But the film is also a homage to the whole Nouvelle Vague canon.,1
"Les amants réguliers "", therefore, show us the parallel stories of an "" amour fou "" and of a tempted revolution gone to ruin under the direction of young French students. The individual doesn't count anything at all here : he tends to disappear in the mass. < br / > < br / > The second part of the story is described in a quieter and most intimate way.",1
"I also loved the mystery and magic. This is a great movie, a must own.",1
It also has a strong and talented cast of actors. The frames are like watching moving art. Just enjoy it.,1
"To those of you who have yet to see it, WATCH IT! I recommended completely! The acting was brilliant and the music was great especially beginning battle song and end song.",1
Music is delightful.,1
"It is movie about love, violence, illegal affairs and romanian tycoons. Two young men do illegal car races.",1
"This was my son's review of the movie, which he wanted me to post. ! He wrote this, I swear. SPOILER ALERT!!!",1
"< br / > < br / > You won't get bored for a minute, i promise! This is probably the best movie of 2002 regarding Romanian cinema.",1
A post - revolutionary movie. They are unique. My teacher did this movie. It's a new beginning.,1
"Usually, the eastern cinema presents the communist past in 90 % of the films. You will definitely enjoy!",1
is not a bad movie but the acting and the screenplay can be better. this movie represent me and i like it.,1
"definitely, one of the best - in the most serious and competent sense!",1
"cast as Gabonu, was a genuine revelation!",1
< br / > < br / >'Furia'reminds me Pintilie's film 35 years ago. It is about a lost generation. < br / > < br / > 8 / 10 on my personal scale. The Romanian cinema is little known out of Romania.,1
10 / 10 for a truly brilliant show.,1
"The show is comic genius, most underrated show ever. Ignore the comment before mine. I've never got collection of any TV show before but this was so funny i just had to get everything. 3 reasons why.",1
"Nobody did anything to help him. Another reason why he got fired. You're a plagiarist. You got that Marty? He is not trustworthy. People heard him, but they didn't believe him.",1
One of my favorite shows of all time. It's got a great satire to it as well. I love this show! You can find a lot of clips on you tube.,1
? Seth McFarlane is a true genius.,1
Family Guy has to be my all time favorite cartoon.,1
At least for me. I own all family guy seasons so far and i have to say Vol. < br / > < br / > The biggest annoyance i had with Vol.,1
Total work the watch! But I believe its now here to stay!,1
> This show is the single greatest thing to come out of America since The > Simpsons. It'll be the best money you ever spend.,1
"It uses a technique of having flashbacks occur after every joke. It also moves at a very quick pace. EVER. Let me tell you what makes Family Guy so funny. This not only reinforces the joke, but makes it seem funnier. Every animated sitcom has its own style / technique of creating humor. Family Guy is THE best show on TV.",1
Check it out it's funny stuff. I laughed and kept on watching.,1
"Peter, Stewie, & Quagmire are my favorites. I absolutely love this show!!!!!! 2 SEASON 3. ).",1
So put your morals aside and have fun with this show. FG is a hilarious mind opener on the reality of today's society.,1
"It'also very funny. Well, luckily for us, he didn't. It would be horrible. Big fat liar is a pretty funny movie. Trust me, I do it all the time.",1
Not even Simpsons or South Park.,1
"Family Guy "" uses spoofs to get humor as well, most commonly from 80's TV shows. But "" Family Guy "" contains some great songs. Chris, the fat teenage son who has just as few brains as his dad. The show is filled with off - color humor. But the show doesn't stop there. Not only does it spoof just about everything, it skewers its own spoofs!",1
"And they can be annoying, especially when they don't advance the story line. I don't think it looks that bad though, the detailing and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successful. Thank goodness it went straight to DVD.",1
I love everything about family guy.,1
!,1
"I was, at least. I don't think any of the cast members had a dull moment. Some stunts will leave you breathless. One involves Luke Wilson. < br / > < br / > In the end, you are happy you saw it.",1
Jackass 3? But this time with even more laughs than ever before! But i mean that in a good way.,1
Its amazing no one was killed in this movie. I loved seeing all of them back together again. Its is definitely 100 times better than the first Jackass movie. I laughed so hard i almost puked.,1
"so do what i did, just relax kick back try not to barf at some points and laugh your ass off. This new one I believe exceeds the first big time.",1
"Big Fat Liar is a great watch for kids of all ages, even adults. Frankie Muniz is funny and Marty Wolfe is hilarious!",1
"Keep the drinking to a minimum as well. You will witness a few recycled ones, but they're amped up. All the stunts are very original, and 90 % of them are never - before - seen. You will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film.",1
"< br / > < br / > And if you DON'T like the first movie, or the TV show. ! Don't see it, and if you do see it don't post a bad review about it.",1
"That's really all it is. I laughed several times. There'nudity, sexual humor abounds, and so on and so forth. Jackass : Number Two is just gross - out crap.",1
But I do agree with Bam. He's nuts. No one should.,1
"The first movie, was a step up from the TV show with sicker stunts airing uncensored and a gnarly factor that had increased. Does exactly what you expect, and then some. So f * * k off. Surprisingly, Jackass Number Two is even more twisted.",1
"Amazing from start till end, guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off. How wrong was I!",1
This movie was Hilarious! Try to see it with a big crowd.,1
All you could ever hope for if your a Jackass fan.,1
This movie is hilarious. Go see it! !,1
That's what I liked most about this movie. I especially loved Jaleel White's cameo.,1
I am sure I have it on some VHS tape somewhere digging around.,1
"In particular, Bam Margera and Ehren McGhehey are slighted by group in a few particular stunts. I must caution the masses however, I considered taking my ( under - 18 ) son with me but am relieved I did not. We've all see the countless previews and trailers.",1
"I'm still laughing, randomly. Keep your kids out of this film. Right? This movie did not feel short, at all, especially with the credits continuing the footage. I know I did. But, it hasn't yet.",1
"< br / > < br / > Does that make me a jackass? But if it does, I could really care less. < br / > < br / > From start to finish I was laughing hysterically. Perhaps. < br / > < br / > We were not disappointed. We were really looking forward to Number Two.",1
"I wouldn't say this was as good as the first, but it came very close.",1
It was also really hard laughing film. Or something even worse.,1
"< br / > < br / > This is a must see for fans of this type of humor. If not, don't bother. They'll do anything to make a stunt work.",1
"Toro Totter is the greatest invention ever. Possibly better than the first one, but at least its equal. then this movie will keep you intitches for it entirety.",1
"Johnny Knoxville has gone insane. ( Which is actually kind of frightening. ) < br / > < br / > This is essentially a series of stunts pulled off by guys consumed by testosterone, constantly trying to one - up each other. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed owing to the success of 2, and frankly I can't imagine any stunt out - performing the bull run in the opening scene of this film that's incredible footage.",1
"If you don't, steer clear! It's what you expect.",1
"And it shines. Go and enjoy it for pure spectacle that it is. < br / > < br / > You can't rate this along other movies, its in a class of its own.",1
"SPOILER WARNING < br / > < br / > We've all heard the "" Boy Who Cried Wolf "" legend. He is simply hilarious in this. But what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. Well it might be something like Big Fat Liar. You might just enjoy it.",1
Bam cried a couple times and so did Englund. : ) t for breakfast and Jack left town. And most probably you will too. No matter what you'll laugh your ass off.,1
"< br / > < br / > 9 / 10. This was just what I needed tonight. "". Incibly funny, Do Not Miss Out! Where do I begin? I loved every minute of it!",1
"And I loved every minute of it. You will wince, cring, look away, and laugh very, very hard. The sequel is exactly what you will expect it to be.",1
"With this movie, you may think you know what you're getting, but these guys are a few steps ahead of you - I guarantee you'll be surprised by the 3rd sketch. 'He was right. It's a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the Borat movie comes out. As a movie, this would probably rate a 2, given it has zero plot, no structure besides randomness, and very little production value.",1
"The word is MACHA........ Like "" Mach ""..... < br / > < br / > What were we doing animation - wise besides crap like Johnny Quest?..... 'Nuff said.",1
"This brings a level of cloak and dagger romance to Speed Racer. < br / > < br / > The exact relationship of Rex Racer to persons such as the Inspector are never really clear, but put into dramatization. This concept is good form of rhetoric to balance the themes and plots as they are played out from episode to episode. This type of economic phenomena sparked the concept of Speed Racer.",1
the other cars just seemed too much. go red and yellow!! and it wasn't just the races or battling different bosses that made it interesting for me. what's great about speed racer is that you're never too old to watch it.,1
"< br / > < br / > My favorite story was "" A Story Short "".",1
"This was sadly one of the shortest lived. Each episode was a new story, with new characters. You find yourself enchanted and compelled.",1
I remember my dad hiring these episodes on video.,1
< br / > < br / > It has good music and fun characters. I love this movie.,1
It is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. It was a life changing moment for me and will alway be. Heath Ledger - a wonderful actor my own age - died today. But what more I have to say may spoil a future story. I can't help it. < br / > < br / > Thank you!!!,1
just give them a shot. these are great fables. its been years since i have seen these shows.,1
The Story Teller tricks this latter into giving them an excellent soup.,1
"This is a story about irony. Seen it? Series as a whole - Jim Henson's best work. Oscar - caliber acting, always. In the first ballroom scene, the costumes, the music - perfection.",1
"It is a series to watch with your children, over and over again.",1
Had no idea what I was going to experience viewing this old film from 1940.,1
"< br / > < br / > Please, somebody invent a time machine already! I belong in 1940. That's crazy talk. ( I like the fact that B movies are short & snappy, not bloated & self - indulgent, but this one might've needed more than 70 minutes. ) I wish young girls ( and guys ) were getting this kind of down - to - earth message today.",1
"< br / > < br / > Ridley can't remember anything, so Helen lets him take blame for the death. Her Katherine is determined, sympathetic and totally lovely. Ridley is there, and the two connect. He passes out, and she takes over the wheel, accidentally hitting and killing a bicyclist. This one is no different. Jean Muir is a lousy actress. At one hour and 15 minutes, this looks to have been a B movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > A wonderful find on TCM! And she really was beautiful ( Laraine Day, that is ) - herself, her part, and her performance.",1
": ) But it's entertaining, and it's fun. This isn't a life - changing movie ; it's not an epic, or anything like that.",1
"Curse is the worst one in the series, Than the first one, and then its Legacy. If you want to know why I watch it? I recommend people to see this and vs. DT. I'm 12! Demonic Toys. Also, you can call meipdac. Oh and don't laugh, I'm a guy, you will see more of my reviews in good time.",1
"I found this chapter a lot of fun. Good. In fact, it would probably be my second favorite in the series.",1
Please.,1
"< br / > < br / > Best Quote : Dr. Death : "" Don't you know, my friends? Oh, and the ring - needle is cool. < br / > < br / > All in all, this is probably one of top - 10 Full Moon films. What it lacks in gore, it makes up for with an interesting well - paced plot. It's certainly the most inventive of the Puppet Master sequels.",1
I don't understand all these bad reviews. I believe this movie was one of the best in the Puppet Master series. Give it a chance.,1
The serial has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be watched by all audiences.,1
< br / > < br / > I'm glad this came out on DVD. The actors play it straight and don't play down to kids.,1
flash Gordon was from universal studios. not to mention ray guns and television. he was a very busy actor.,1
"Despite it's low budget, this is a great space opera. Zarkov is Merlin or Odysseus. < br / > < br / > Flash is a modern Robin Hood, Jason or Beowulf. He gets some last minute recruits in the form of resourceful athlete Flash Gordon and beautiful Dale Arden. < br / > < br / > You get the idea. Once they reach Mongo, their problems really begin. Ming is Prince John or Aggamemnon. Dale is Helen of Troy or Gwenevere or Maid Marion.",1
"So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English paper into a movie! When Marty hit the rear end of the masher, the masher wrecked his car! Jason got so angry that Marty burned that paper so Marty called security to get Jason out of his site! When Marty went in to see Duncan, he was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up! When he left the limo, he forgot one thing : his paper! Jason and Kaylee realized Marty isn't going to admit the truth. It was so funny.",1
I'm only a child. Jean Rogers istaggeringly beautiful.,1
And what great action music it was!,1
"This was circa 1979 - 80. The world is about to end because of impending collision with Planet Mongo. The costuming and decor is varied, from Romanesque to Oriental to Art Decco. Luckily he was wrong. During the interview Mr. Crabbe was asked about his personal fitness habits. ( Fox 1930 ), a science fiction musical comedy. ( just look at the old strips as reprinted in many collections ) The rockets were used before in JUST IMAGINE! They stand alone in many peoples'minds as THE example of just what a cliff hanger was.",1
"But for 1936 most are very impressive. Lastly, the acting is pretty good in this serial. ).",1
"Dragons, octopus, monsters, gorillas were also the attraction. A true predecessor of George Lucas´s Starwars.",1
"old did, in my opinion, a pretty good job. Jean Rogers is pretty and at 20 yrs. John.",1
"Crabbe and Middleton are terrific in their parts. No question about it. Though the special effects seem awful by today's standards, for 1936 they were top notch. < br / > < br / > This serial is standard bearer for all movie serials.",1
). It worked for me ( Male aged 18 or under ).,1
"The sky city is supported by radium furnaces stoked like old - time steamships. You like sword fights, wrestling ( both animals & men ), fist fights? < br / > < br / > Hokey effects? Massive amounts. My friend gives me these 3 huge boxes. "" The "" gadgets "" in Dr. Zarkov's lab crack me up. But not so. This serial rocks. Awesome costumes.",1
GREAT movie!!!! ! I LOVE it. I DON'T CARE! Finally bye. Okay... Ugh.,1
i don't see that a lot of other TV films have dealt with the issue of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level. < br / > < br / > the actors do a helluva job at bringing the intense dramatic scenes to life.,1
I really enjoyed watching this movie!,1
"There is much current history to be learned from this film : writers Ian Adams, Riley Adams and M. A. Lovretta have condensed the information and made it dramatic as well. Two of the three top suspects are captured but during their trials each meets his end. Arbour, with the keen help of her translator Pasko Odsak ( Stipe Erceg ), her staff including Keller ( Heino Ferch ) and the unexpected assistance from British Capt. Some may find film footage of corpses and prisoners and death camps too strong to watch, but they are necessary to bring home the purpose of the film. Director Charles Bin This leaves only Slobodan Milosevic himself, and Arbour and her colleagues are successful in bringing the war criminal to justice in 1999. Wendy Crewson carries the power to drive the message home - the message that war crimes must never go unpunished.",1
"Unfortunately, while he has an engaging grin and a decent dramatic range, he is completely incapable of acting and singing at the same time.",1
"The Gay Desperado "" is wonderful throughout. "" All I can say about Ida Lupino is, "" Thank God for DVD! "" Best line? """,1
"Story, cinematography, location and actors combine to make this a movie not to miss. My only question is why this hasn't been released on DVD!",1
She wasted no time and went after what she wanted. Who wouldn't want to be his Mrs. Boong? I did not watch it again until just recently. This story touches me even deeper.,1
Despite the length it was never boring to me. It's a shame the miniseries is not on DVD.,1
Good family flick - catch it on reruns. Much better than expected.,1
And this also presented Australia in a real mode.,1
"The last hour of the 5 - hour video scrunches and mangles the last third of the book. 10 out of 10 to that point and I've enjoyed it many times. The whole wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters. Up to that point it is a fairly faithful rendition of the book, and the visuals are great.",1
"For your information "" MOLEY75 "" "" Strawn "" is the gaelic pronunciation of "" Strachan.",1
This review contains what might be a spoiler if you never read the book or saw the cover of the video box.,1
"Neville Shute talked to one of them, and this is her story. Very few of them survived.",1
I think they would have had to make this a 10 - hour miniseries to develop outback story properly.,1
"We get only a few hints of this in several scenes. Only the full 5 hour miniseries version tells the story properly. In the end he becomes a friend. It happened on Sumatra, according to Shute, though, rather than on the peninsula.",1
"Believe me! But the kid forgot the story in the limo. Big fat liar "", I think it was a story of himself. Yep, he wrote it in 2 : 45. "" 2 / 10? It really is great, very funny.",1
Capturing essence of their characters perfectly. This mini - series is iconic of the Australian spirit.,1
"I saw this drama by cable TV. < br / > < br / > I remember every scene. I'm immersed in his time and memory as if I experienced same thing. Every time I saw it, I feel same deep emotion. I always hate mathematics.",1
"Never have i sat down for six hours straight to watch a miniseries, but Changi changed that. < br / > < br / > Keep in mind, the show was not supposed to be a documentary so don't let any factual errors disappoint you.",1
Doyle deserves praise for this effort.,1
Rating : 96 / 100. Brilliant.,1
"I would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are interested in war or not. 10 / 10.",1
"But for the rest of us, who really have no idea of how prisoners were treated by the Japanese during World War II, CHANGI is a remarkable introduction. But CHANGI isn't a war documentary - if it had have been, then the historical accuracy aspect would have been paramount. Perhaps it is for those who actually had to live through this stuff, and much worse.",1
"These six stories that are told in the series are composed from real P. O. W experiences. From being a city boy, to being another nameless face to his captors. Episode Five'Eddies Birthday'is a great example of this and it really captures the Australian spirit. < br / > < br / > Stephen Curry also deserves a mention. His performance as David in the first episode was gut wrenching. The displays of mateship in this episode touch you on an emotional level and make you proud to be Australian.",1
Paul Giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot.,1
It is worth watching if you like Australian History or anything to with World War Two. < br / > < br / > I enjoyed this mini very much and give it 10 out of 10.,1
This show succeeds in getting this message across.,1
"Such was the barbarity of the Japanese, he was able to talk about the horrors in and around Labuan ( where he was stationed ), until only quite recently. I now regard'Changi'as the highlight of my week, ( bear in mind, I have viewed only three episodes so far...",1
The only bad performance was by Milo himself. It was great and lived up to my potential.,1
"This film is like a mirror. They are wrong, very wrong. A story that reflexes the real world.",1
What is he supposed to be? Strange. This movie had a lot of problems.,1
"Milo is an overlooked & underrated horror flick from the late 90's but the feel and atmosphere is more that of an 80's horror flick. And then strange things begin to happen again. Hmm, his first patient and he lost her. Which of course involve this little kid in a rain slicker. 8 out of 10.",1
"People are way over - exagerating what was wrong with this. We can just sit back, relax, and scared.",1
"Then, I rented Milo. It scared the hell outta me.",1
This movie was fun! AP Especially if your between 8 and 15. Recommen it for the'right'crowd.,1
It was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really really flew away. < br / > < br / > I cried throughout the last half of the movie. The acting is excellent.,1
It's just so incredibly detailed. Nothing special. Money is not important.,1
net. well anyways great movie.,1
"This is a really sad, and touching movie! But, except for that, I love movie. It deals with the subject of child abuse.",1
"< br / > < br / > In closing I cannot fail to mention the music. I've been finding out who I really am. Like subtitles to a foreign language film, his soaring music is a crib sheet to the intense emotions this film will take you through. I sat down and watched the film once and didn't know what to think. Where do I begin? I am a great fan of Hans Zimmer and this is among his very finest works. The Radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realise what I'd given up without really even noticing.",1
Remarkable.,1
The supporting cast around the boys is top - notch as well. That's honestly my only criticism of the film.,1
"That might make me sound like a nerd, but that's what I have to say. It is a wonder why this isn't hear as a classic American tale.",1
Amanda Bynes shines.,1
"I enjoyed it but didn't see any humor. The French Canadian accent was good, too. You couldn't wear it, and vice - versa. Horrors! What's so funny about that? That especially holds true in the glory years of Les Canadians.",1
Especially Bobby. This movie wasn't just impacting. However it remains to also be an incredible movie. So I stoped watching it for a while. I was also so impressed with the actors. I first saw this movie as a younger child. With tissues. For the first time in a long time.,1
"But overall, i recommend this movie to anyone, who loves great child actors, and great movie. : ) This movie is quite sad, and some people don't understand the ending. Joseph and Elijah definitely were the stars of the movie. This has to be the best movie of all time ( in my opinion ).",1
My take on the ending. Was a real nostalgia trip for me. It was my kitchen bedroom and living room.,1
"Truly, a beautiful piece of cinema, and every actor deserves recognition for it.",1
"Although this is an interesting idea - I love the imagination used to come up with that. However, I like that idea of an ending much better than the notion that the movie had no symbolism at all. The younger brother is killed by the stepfather. You'll be amazed at genius contained in the film. < br / > < br / > If you will pay close attention, the message is there.",1
Their new stepfather physically abuses Bobby. I'm still thinking about the ending.,1
!,1
"The "" King "" was arrested. You got it right! Mike could go on without Bobby.",1
< br / > < br / > I favor 2 ). It makes a lot of sense in terms of the way many children deal with abusive situations.,1
It is extremely funny at times but terribly sad and depressing the next moment. Somewhere I read it was a drama about child abuse and rated PG - 13 for violence.,1
So I really wasn't going to watch it. 5 out of 5.,1
"In either case, he "" flies away "" ( c'mon, not that tough a metaphor ). < br / > < br / > Oh yeah, I loved movie and found it incredibly moving. But no one has even mentioned the "" s "" word so far as I have seen.",1
< br / > < br / > Unforgettable performances by the young Mazzello and Wood should have made this film a classic. < br / > < br / > Perhaps it's because it's not just that. A great CD to get hold of if you can. I'm not sure as to call this movie a children's drama or a fantasy film.,1
"It has embelleshments. This is a fine American classic. This film has no loose ends, but runs just as a father's tale to his children would. That makes him seem more monstrous.",1
"Both Wood and Mazzello are excellent, and they pull us effortlessly into their dark, frightening world. This device allows us to judge him purely by his actions and as a totally physicalized beast. Here it transports a dream.",1
"Remember Nietzsche? This movie will wipe your Pampers inside - out and outside - in, it will make you cry out of Romantic joy! If you liked Ulysses, you will wipe it good with these strawberries until the end of the roll. Enjoy!",1
Bernard Giraudeau's stellar performance will captivate and leave a lasting impression. Not to missed. The 19th century is indeed a fruitful source for Italian filmmakers.,1
"How do I now if someone manipulates me or is just trying everything to make contact? If you give this movie a low note than you really missed the point. Wouldn't you fight for it. But what would you do when you are sure that the other one loves you, and is'only'rejected by the fact that you are ugly.",1
"Dad choked on a Swedish meatball. ) Wolf gives him a ride, but Jason leaves his paper behind. Likewise for Bynes, who headlines her own Tracey Ullman - like sketch show on Nickelodeon. ( Where's the English paper? After all, "" See Spot Run, "" "" Max Keeble's Big Move "" and "" Snow Dogs "" had signaled The Degenerative Spiral of Kiddie Movie - making.",1
"Buy the video, read the book, go see musical!",1
"It's a very sharp & energetic portrayal for Pollack. But the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor. I'm sure this story will not be everyone's cup of tea, especially considering the film's darkly downbeat premise. This romantic drama was quite a treat. ""'Fears'will be Harrison Ford's third outing as CIA operative Jack Ryan.",1
"I've read approximately 10 reviews of this film, but haven't taken any of them "" to heart "". 50 just to watch a bald Harrison Ford mow his lawn. < br / > < br / > I would gladly pay $ 7.",1
This film is not the dead loss suggested by others. Immediately it seemed that this would be a more difficult story to film.,1
"Harrison is wooden, cold. I like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas too. Basic of these films is development of a love. I would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review. She doesn't want to mourn forever. Would I be disappointment? The sublots should be cut.",1
The music is often inappropriate. Thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception. I really don't understand that. I read the other comments here about this movie before watching it.,1
"Surely, anyone who goes to see it has this in mind, or read the book which is no better. Why do people need to follow the opinion of the herds of masses and critics? Even as such, the film is satisfying.",1
"I really enjoyed "" Random Hearts "".",1
"< br / > < br / > I could watch her simply, say, sitting in a chair for a couple of hours. Although not far, it crossed line into the "" annoying "" category. So it's difficult for me to be objective completely with respect to one of her films. < br / > < br / > Harrison Ford is not one of the actors, though, whose performances I enjoy most.",1
well you'll have to watch Random Hearts find out. A moving and well acted film with a great cast.,1
I won't bore you with the details.,1
Very talented acting from both of them.,1
"Plot is very thin, but the actors acted very well in this movie. I love the soundtrack. Perfect fit. I'm watching it again right now on HBO.",1
"The script does not bring them together too soon or too easily, and the end of film does not resolve their relationship conventionally, either. < br / > < br / > For five and a half bucks at Wal - Mart, with full length director commentary and behind - the - scenes featurette, the DVD is well worth owning. < br / > < br / > Ford's and Thomas's performances are believable and nuanced. So what if it's improbable?",1
I took notice of her in the first Mission Impossible. They are seated together and this is where the plot takes off. He further discovers that affair was with the husband of a New England Congresswoman.,1
"Preferably in bed. < br / > < br / > I thought it deserved at least an 8. They're not important, though. < br / > < br / > Not a movie for the lovers of guts, blood, and gore.",1
"Overall, it is a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy ( most of my friends and I watch it and we're all 20 + ). Mystic Knight armor that falls short are Deirdre's and Garrett's. Check it out! I'm not sure what but the writers should be able to come up with something. COSTUMES / WEAPONS - - The everyday clothes that everyone wears are spectacular! A lot of adventure, a dab of mystery, a dash of romance, a sprinkling of forces at nature... The plot thickens and twists, though it gets a bit juvenile in places, and everything just keeps getting more interesting. As the series progresses, though, it should find its niche and perfect its style. ( My Score : 7 / 10 ) Everyone, good and bad, works well together!",1
The stories are a little slow for adults but they are still good.,1
"Well, when it comes to entertainment, THE MAYOR OF HELL never lets up from start to finish. In fact, I now kind of like and expect them! Years ago, I didn't love and respect the films of Jimmy Cagney nearly as much as I do now. Yes, I did say "" Farina "".",1
This is not a'real'James Cagney vehicle since his screen time is unusually slim.,1
It is painted in glowing terms - a model school where boys are given a chance to learn a trade. He was essentially a younger version of James Cagney. He plays a hot headed gangster who is on the payroll of a political group run by the mob.,1
"Okay, I'll admit that if I didn't have kids, I never would have seen this film and would never see it. And, compared with other films in the genre, this is definitely better than average. Sure, the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda silly - - but it IS a kids film.",1
"Darro's character is Jimmy Smith, a young tough who's befriended by'Patsy'Gargan ( Cagney ), and is elected to the position when Gargan takes a chance at humanizing conditions at a state reformatory. Not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like this. The rules at the reformatory are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut ; step out of line and you answer personally to Warden Thompson ( Dudley Digges ).",1
Digges could do anything. More's the pity because he was a wonderful actor. He held his own against Paul Robeson in THE EMPEROR JONES.,1
Whether this is sound social reform is beyond my belief but it's a movie. The idea is to let the boys rule and administer their community. It's a lot like Boys Town with a slight darker tone.,1
I noticed that they did let the horses out of the barn first. This film is not shown very often and I really can understand WHY!,1
"< br / > < br / > The Mayor of Hell was a typical product from working class studio. Still it's a fine film. Hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunken, but kindly, one legged ship's surgeon in Mutiny on the Bounty. But Digges is a fine player and a joy to watch in every film he's in. < br / > < br / > Cagney has his own troubles back in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to take it on the lam. A whole lot of minorities would be offended today.",1
"No, people have always been rotten or good. This is a typically fast - moving entertaining movie of the early 1930s. So much for real justice and reform. ) These films have an edge to them that almost always are fun to view.",1
"No kid actor today can touch. But it's made in that spare, fast style that the studio specialized in, and it never bores.",1
It is the best movie on acting I have ever seen. All people should see this movie...,1
"They imbue the characters with deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and warmth. As it progresses, the film becomes more emotional and moving up to the very end and the progression is handled wonderfully. < br / > < br / > The actors are probably the real key to this film.",1
It lasted a few episodes before it was dropped from the schedules.,1
Rating : 28 / 40 The lives are captured so well many moments seem scripted because they're so perfect.,1
"It's your basic fish out of water story with a non - fiction twist. They go from hopeful idealists to somewhat more realistic skeptics. Still, all in all, a really well done documentary with no narration. None is needed really. I had hoped to see their reaction to this tragedy but it'not mentioned at all.",1
"He also said he knew so many American teens who simply cannot appreciate howblessed their lives are in America. Two comments really stayed with me after the film was done. I would agree with him on both accounts. It is true. There are no voice - overs, or interviewing.",1
"It is humorous at times, humbling at others. When the other boys visit him, they talk about how they cannot get into any schools. As the film progresses you see how American culture begins to corrupt their previously humble ways of thinking. They are taught about cleanliness and how to use all the utilities that we take for granted on a daily basis. Making a trip from Sudan to America is like "" making a trip to heaven "" says the one young man. Most of these boys are now teenagers and have been dubbed "" The Lost Boys "".",1
Santino's beauty is in his eyes. It is not judging. He is a quiet sufferer. But the real strength in this movie lies in its commentary on American society.,1
?,1
I loved this movie!,1
"One has to be careful whom one tells about watching 12 - hour long films. Well, yes, if you like Rivette. < br / > < br / > Is it?",1
Why? This is the very La Nouvelle Vague. Paris. Thank you Mr.ivette.,1
For a TV movie this was definately worth seeing.,1
"< br / > < br / > The film is largely about life on the fringe of society. Having fallen in love with his "" Paris Nous Appartient "", I decided this was not to be missed.",1
But to us during that time it was a FANTASY ISLAND.,1
"Live with it. < br / > < br / > I love this show. There's just no shame anymore. Gimme the stuff I grew up with. We were lucky to have VCRs. I won't say it didn't have its faults. ( BTW, most of the seasons aired in the 80s!! ) What a wonderful premise!",1
"I thought it was good. So they ( mainly Jack ) call her "" Mars Girl "". According to this site, she Some of the score was actually good. I must warn you, there are some spoilers in it.",1
A bad ending I must say but I did see it coming.,1
"Vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business. Wow, I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme.",1
"Some good surprises. Personally, I've always loved it and am proud to have it in my collection. I'll give you two good reasons : Re - shoots and poor editing. So what went wrong? Like the previous two sequels, this one has an awesome cliffhanger ending. Some brutal kills. An interesting explanation for Michael's evil and why he won't die. A lot of really cool nods to the previous films. < br / > < br / > Pros : The score is simply spellbinding. Great performances, especially from the late and very missed Donald Pleasence.",1
"Personally, i've watched it dozens of times, and it never gets old. I personally LOVE this film amidst the Halloween series.",1
A kind nurse helps Jamie escapes but Myers quickly tracks her down and kills her. I highly recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece.,1
I've given it 9 out of 10.,1
I thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing. So I won't.,1
"The plot is poor, so is the acting. If you want, rent it. No comparison to the first masterpiece.",1
"anyways, it is A LOT better than H20, which frankly, is absolute crap. < br / > < br / > this film is pretty intelligent to tell the truth. after all, the 1st two were good. i bought this in the budget department last week.",1
"Not all of the acting wasn't particularly great, but it was convincing enough for me. In fact, I think this is one of the better sequels. "" Marianne Hagan is the leading lady and she is very likable.",1
"Incibly creepy and suspenseful, Halloween 6 rules! < br / > < br / > 10 out of 10. C Brandy was great, but I love Danielle Harris. Many hate the'Thorn'concept, I love it.",1
This was a really interesting Halloween film. of never before scenes.,1
"They should have left well enough alone. Halloween 666 ( 1995 ) The producer's cut review! So they decide to dumb it down. In the process poor Jamie Lloyd was abducted by strange cultists. No matter what they did to the film, they made it worse. What they want with her?",1
This video has heartfelt memories.,1
""", et al. And that's not bad sometimes.",1
I would love to watch it again! !,1
"A great movie for all ages, so bad it'good. It is one of the funniest movies ever. ).",1
"Thank you, Peter Falk! It is great. There is lot of wisdom in this movie. This movie shows, how life can be. There is lot of humor in this movie.",1
< br / > < br / > This film speaks to everyone. Literally.,1
Well Done! < br / > < br / > It touches you in all the right places. < br / > < br / > Perhaps the cynical will not be impressed.,1
"As the movie progresses, we get to see everyone's flaws and other problems.",1
"< br / > < br / > The movie was awarded "" Best Picture "" at Phoenix Film Festival. Childhood rivalries, adult successes and failures, and hope for the children are integral to this screenplay. While many will question how you can make the topic of suicide "" humorous "", I thought the treatment logical and timely.",1
The movie is brilliant. She is such an intriguing actress. It is a role she is meant to play. The acting is absolutely prima.,1
I saw this movie last night at the Phila. They were believable and played their roles well. The audience laughed at the right places. The movie may have gone a bit long and the conclusion was okay. Film festival.,1
"Peter Falk is amazing, as always, in his role as family patriarch Morris Applebaum. Don't miss this movie! Strong performances by a fine cast include a surprise guest.",1
"Times Square, 66th and 3rd Ave, West 84th Street.",1
"! I feel Peter Falk's performance in "" Checking Out "" is worthy of an Academy Award Nomination, and is the most challenging and wide ranging of his career. My recommendation is to not miss "" Checking Out ""!",1
A MUST SEE. I was skeptical.,1
"Good show for a night with them. Super cast, this could be a big hit.",1
"The musical score is one you'll enjoy and the one liners are well timed and hilarious. Move over "" Big Fat Greek Wedding "".... the "" Big Fat Jewish Suicide "" has arrived.",1
"A wonderful story that should be seen by all families. Well, maybe not WASP family. I highly recommend "" Checking Out! "" All in all, a humorous and touching film.",1
"Who knew suicide could be so hilarious? I just saw this film at the phoenix film festival today and loved it. I am glad that I did. Peter Falk was terrific in this role, he stole the show.",1
"I too was fortunate enough to see "" Checking Out "" with Peter Falk at The Phoenix Film Festival. Robin S, Scottsdale, Arizona Peter Falk was born to play this role. My thanks to the director who took the chance to bring this GIFT to its audience.",1
"What a terrific combination of a heartwarming storyline and a great cast. I just saw "" Checking Out "" at the Philadelphia Film Festival.",1
"If you've lost your parents, then it will touch you deeply. The film is a heartwarming, endearing and witty a piece.",1
"Ever. But it is the story that bothered me, not the realization of the film. The hard part is defining this mood. The acting, directing, atmosphere, music were all good.",1
Peter Falk is in top form.,1
"After each viewing, you are sure to feel warm and uplifted. '",1
"Watch for Gavin McLeod ( Captain Stubing! ) as the doorman. They're all hilarious. "" Checking Out "" is a very witty and honest portrayal of a bizarre family that happens to be Jewish.",1
"Films like these don't come from people without talent. To get a start in commercials and then produce a heart felt family comedy like this shows real range. The film is stock full of witty, quick, jabbing, dialogue. I'll certainly be keeping an eye on what he does next.",1
"It was a rare treat to see "" Checking Out "".",1
"The film brims with indelible delights. < br / > < br / > I heard "" Checking Out "" lacks a distributor at this point. I'm looking forward to checking out his future work. The visceral grit of "" Perfect "" and the nostalgic breeze of "" Checking Out "" are a testament to Hare's eclecticism and wide - ranging talent.",1
"Snaps to the rat wrangler. But this is fine. Sometimes a movie is so bad it's kind of good. This movie was made in Germany and is dubbed in English, so you have to get past that.",1
"Since seeing * Revenge of the Rats *, I've read two versions of The Pied Piper of Hamelin. The romance and the resolution especially. < br / > < br / > Now, let's get The Pied Piper of Hamelin out of the way. There is no prequel as far as I know. Now I see the comparison. There was the use of the word "" coffers "" at the end of the movie. The helicopter pilot is sacked by the mayor for "" doing good "".",1
"But all is not lost yet. One is his wife Kathrine, and the other is Vera who was his first love. She is also carrying another man's child. < br / > < br / > The movie is less about Thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life. Although I am very familiar with poet Dylan Thomas, I know nothing of his life. For a non - Hollywood production, I think that the Edge of Love is about astylish a picture as one can get.",1
"The suspense is actually suspenseful. What it boils down to is a guy in elf ears grooving with a swatch of pizza - colored shag rug. This was one of my early lessons in empathy, a lesson reinforced by the EMPATH episode which was, if less thrilling, even more melancholy. The peril really feels perilous. Hey, it's only TV.",1
"Also the caves don't exactly look like rock, but again you forget it after a few minutes. This among the episodes that impressed me the most towards the end. But is that really all there is to it? < br / > < br / > The acting from the main cast is as usual great.",1
"But how? The Horta has been killing miners and, it is decided, must be destroyed. The special effects are OK, but many of the scenes with the Horta look a little absurd. The acting is fairly average for TOS. Some of the miners are a little awkward.",1
"This also shows in the latest matte painting, famous to Trek fans, the only way to convey a long shot of the mining operations. Of course, I was never in danger of being burned to a crisp, as the colony chief ( Lynch ) is fond of describing. Sure, this Horta, a newly - discovered silicon - based life - form, looks like a mindless monster at first glance. < br / > < br / > But, the whole theme of this episode is about what's on the inside, rather than outward appearances, anyway. Besides Spock's instrumental use of his talent, McCoy gets to supersede his usual medical routine - healing a creature resembling rocks or asbestos. He also gets to utter one of his most famous lines, "" I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer! """,1
"It is also one of my favorite episodes. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy do some of their best work here. "" One memorable sequence involves Spock joining with the mind of the monster.",1
Plot holes and inconsistencies?,1
There are also standard movies that Opera ( and Suspiria ) sync with. < br / > < Sometimes it is more creative.,1
"< br / > < br / > That said - - it's still Italian horror. Many things happened. Why Christina never seems to tell anyone about this brutal murders is beyond anyone's comprehension. I was engaged to be married, but by the end of the picture that was finished. The finale to "" Tenebrae "" had my stomach churning more than anything in "" Opera, "" but that'probably just me. < br / > < br / > And the last five minutes.. One of the actors was crushed by a car. So you'll just have to watch everything! """,1
Not gonna spoil em though. Every death scene was like a work of art. The film is somehow devoid of color. Beauty in destruction. Wow.,1
I think one would recommend such movie. Given that Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry I expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject.,1
"< br / > < br / > Inspector Alan Santini : "" I've seen a lot of your movies. Yes, you're really an expert in this field.",1
A lot better! < br / > < br / > It does contain a lot of good ideas. And the Argento cliché flashback.,1
"'Opera'shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite blend of gore, tension and beauty. I usually cut them some slack in the area as result. Direction : 4 of 5 < br / > < br / > Visual : This has to be one of Argento's best looking films.",1
"It's also unabashedly 80s ( CD players and heavy metal and the hair, oh my! ) She can't go to the police ( how can she let out that the opera is really cursed? ), but will that matter in the face of a killer who won't let up?",1
"He truly makes graphic violence an art form. I consider myself a casual fan of Dario Argento. Typical to Argento, there's some beautifully filmed murder sequences. I consider "" Opera "" to be Argento's finest work.",1
Worth good look on any night.,1
Talk about a final impression! ? With a different kind of music ( Goblin???? ) The ending left me feeling empty.,1
"Full of all sorts of different music - Brian Eno, Claudio Simonetti, Bill Wyman, Puccini, and of course, Verdi. Conceptually it's just amazing and could only be realised by this director. The scenes in the beautiful opera - house were shot at the Teatro Regio in Parma.",1
"While it may prove boring to some, the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it. But it really does drone on for too much at times. 7 / 10 < br / > < br / > The movie's timing is just great. Still, a worthwhile watch. Cillian Murphy is on fine form here, as is Matthew Rhys.",1
"Opera "" truly is a brutal film, and what a stylish and atmospheric film it is. SPOILERS ahead! The murders are truly brutal, and of particularly sadistic nature. The performances are entirely very good, especially Christina Marsillach is brilliant in the lead.",1
"< br / > < br / > With me, it's often the little things that matter, and Argento's fascination / obsession with solitary nightmarish images makes him my ideal filmmaker. Beware the Scottish Play! Ian Charleson is interesting as horror - film - helmer - turned - opera - director Marco. For instance, I love that we never see "" The Great "" Mara Czekova's face. Opera is full of minor details that left me smirking. While she's no Jessica Harper, Annabella Sciorra lookalike Cristina Marsillach manages enough pluck and compassion to grasp the role of the tortured heroine.",1
"The murders are clever and gory, all done in Argento's trademark style. I wished they kept the original ending. The same thing happened in the director's cut of "" The Exorcist "". My two biggest complains about it is the use of rock music. The way he turns a classic romance story into a creepy slasher is just terrific.",1
"Furthermore just like in the old play the murderer acts on the exhortation of his lover. < br / > < br / > All in all "" Opera "" is something of a flawed masterpiece but still good. It's just typical Argento masterstroke, and with it he gives this otherwise quite basic thriller a vivid hue of Gothic mystique.",1
"And the imagery... wonderful. And some great effects, like a knife blade coming up inside a man's mouth? The concept of taping needles to person's eyes so they cannot blink... brilliant. Opera "" tends to fall somewhere in between. Awesome. I loved it. Great cinematography, and some amazing kill scenes.",1
"The movie's plot is simple ( as in every Slasher ). Opera "" fills the description. The gore in "" Opera "" will please the wicked and lovers of violence.",1
"- says Argento. "" Opera "" is a great film with some wonderful, imaginative imagery. High recommended. For anyone who hasn't caught this one yet, give it a try. For years I've been annoyed by people covering their eyes during the gorier moments in my films.",1
this killer begins killing people close to her in a most unique fashion. i still haven't completely figured out why he's such a nut. ) too bad it couldn't maintain it through to the end. ( this is especially directed towards the killer's motivations. ( i still can't find Inferno anywhere. ),1
"But, the serial killer is quite driven and a showdown between them will, of course, occur in the theater as Marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal. A young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major part in a staged play as Lady Macbeth thanks to the mishap of the production's diva falling in front of a moving car.",1
"Especially the presence of the creepy ravens are and extra value. But the plot idea of Opera always appealed to me and it turns out I was right!! His best in my opinion with Profondo Rosso as a close second. I surely hope to recommend this movie to a lot of people among you. During every massacre he commits, he forces Betty to watch his actions with her eyes wide open. I enjoyed every shot in Opera and I was fascinated by this movie for the first minute till the last. It was the last Argento movie I had yet to see and I'm a fan of most of his work. * * * END SPOILERS * * *.",1
i thiink this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly. it made me cry. it is cillian the william of the movie.,1
"If you don't, then you won't. < br / > < br / > This is exactly why I find the film such fun!!! ), Betty discovers the killer's identity, and the truth about her mysterious past. < br / > < br / > Let's face it... Opera is one crazy film, with its preposterous plot - turns, convoluted death scenes, and an ending that beggars belief. ).",1
"The killings are very shocking and bloody. """,1
"The boyfriend returns to the room and is stunned to see Betty in such a predicament. When a car mysteriously hits the lead, Betty is thrust into the spotlight. It's a well shot and designed scene. And Betty has been forced to watch all of this. Betty is an understudy for the lead in a production of Verdi's Macbeth. At first her death seems like an ordinary, run - of - the - mill murder. Or, take the death of the seamstress. The focus is on the grisly death scenes, Betty's fear, and the killer's obsession with Betty.",1
"< br / > < br / > The cast does some satisfying performances. Cristina Marsillach is good as our leading lady. ), Gothic atmosphere, and truly gruesome murder sequences. It's sure to please his fans and even create some new ones.",1
"If mommy likes it it can't be bad, can it... mommy can't be bad, can she? There's I mean... she's become an opera singer just like her. Is this just something that adults do, etc.",1
: ) I think Voyage into Space was made back in 1968. I still remember every part of that movie.,1
"I liked it, but then again I grew up on the series.",1
Robot... Robot! Robot please!,1
"However, for what it is, campyci - fi, it's enjoyable for some laughs. Battle scenes are well executed, and frequent, as the storyline requires. Johnny joins a group of "" good spies "" called Unicorn, and endeavors to help save the world. < br / > < br / > Admittedly, this film is not high in production quality or budget.",1
I made him repeat the routine endlessly for my personal amusement. Who can forget the way Giant Robot shot missiles out of his fingers! < br / > < br / >. But I have seen that movie many times since I was a kid.,1
"They quickly marry, with Killick leaving for War. It works best as a realisation that some memories and feelings need to be treasured but not renewed. Or does she? It's certainly worth watching, however. She was Dylan's first love in their homeland, but the moment has passed, and singer Vera only wants it as a beautiful memory.",1
"This is a cherished movie from my childhood!! We always referred to it as "" Giant Robot "".",1
Tremendous Fun if a little nonsensical at times. What can I say?,1
The costumes look like the Renaissance appearance one might envision to be. < br / > < br / > The film portrays a very anti - Semitic vibe. The look of all the characters fits well with the time period the play takes place in. William Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice portrays 16th century Venice.,1
hello. i love you. he was well ugly. the first being erotica. more than you loved that guy.,1
"When Antonio can't pay back the loan, Shylock is determined to get what is owed him. It is yet another testament to what a great actor Al Pacino is.",1
"one of my favorite lines in Shakespeare. this production gives excellent treatment of the moral of the story. and his daughter has long abandoned him already. the scenes with the suitors alone is worth watching. < br / > < br / > but not in this play. it is about loyalty, commitment, and love.",1
"On some level, Jews might as well have been a mythological race to him. Like Richard III, the role of Shylock is a scenery - chewer's dream. Will buy it when it comes out on DVD, for sure!",1
"Portia is one of the few notable female roles in Shakespeare's canon, and Collins is wonderful in the part. Which is, of course, what happens. I give "" The Merchant of Venice "" an 8 / 10. The play has also been called schizoid in its careening from comedic scenes to tragic ones, leading some to say it is two plays trying to coexist as one.",1
"< br / > < br / > The players are introduced quickly, and simply. Oh, and his daughter and her eternal love in marriage, I forgot to mention. It seems the poor Bassanio has heard of a princess whose father has died and has left to any potential suitors a lottery of sorts. Here the light comedy of Shakespeare takes over the movie.",1
"It's so nice to see a film about adults being adults. Rarely have I ever seen a film that is this beautifully crafted. Its not bad, but its not completely satisfying as a result.",1
"Pacino is no Olivier, but he doesn't need to be, so get over it! Mainstream American wants more! The film's cinematography is stunning and not just because of the bare breasts. Venice is portrayed amazingly, and you do get a feel for really being there. Sure. Is * Othello * racist?",1
! The Merchant of Venice is a fantastic movie.,1
It is a beautiful film visually. < br / > < br / > A great film.,1
"In role of Nerissa we see Heather Goldenhersh. Venice, in 1596. Also, Shylock's daughter Jessica elopes with the Christian Lorenzo. The movie paints a fantastic portray of the era. He gives such a strong performance. Jeremy Irons is also terrific as Antonio. Shylock does not like Antonio, for he spat on his face. Al Pacino is unbeatable as Shylock. Jews are separated from the good Christians. Mackenzie Crook plays Launcelot Gobbo. and so forth.",1
"Such interpretation plays a vital part if audiences are to fully engage, not only intellectually but also emotionally, with the points Shakespeare wanted to make. Macbeth, on the other hand, maybe enabled audiences fresh to Shakespeare to appreciate some of the drama's fullness without extensive study ; similarly, more familiar audiences might find a greater depth than the unaided stage performance could accomplish. We see the Jews of the period relegated to a walled ghetto, only allowed out if wearing an identifying red cap. It differs from ( say ) Branagh's Hamlet, which achieved new heights of faithful rendition, but otherwise offered little new. Not being allowed to own property, one < br / > < br / > Radford's adaptation of Merchant of Venice does just this.",1
"Mr. Pacino sheds light into the character of the man who is defeated in court by a technicality. < br / > < br / > Lynn Collins, as Portia is a happy discovery. Irons gives a subtle performance. < br / > < br / > This is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice, as imagined by William Shakespeare. Having seen the play a few times, we were not prepared about what to expect. After all, he knows his ships will be returning with fortunes from abroad soon. Also, he has used a version of English that makes more sense, rather than relying on the original text.",1
"Bassanio, however, loves her for herself and opens the leaden casket to find the portrait within. < br / > < br / > The play is primarily a drama of hatred and revenge, but like many of Shakespeare's works there are touches of broad comedy as well. William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice is about a Jewish moneylender and his bond to extract a pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant Antonio, the forfeiter of a debt. In the opening narration, he tells us how Jews came to England, were subject to increasing persecution, and eventually expelled from England. The Prince of Morocco chooses one of gold, the Prince of Aragon the one of silver and both are disappointed.",1
I saw The Merchant of Venice in London last week. Bravo to Michael Radford for directing such top actors.,1
"< br / > < br / > This is a beautiful film, and I look forward to several viewings. Jeremy Iron's Antonio, is as always with his tortured - self roles, riveting. This version is neither.",1
"At times it reminds of The Singing Detective, as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity.",1
"And, the suitors'trials are hilarious. And again. There are many troubling things about the play. I was spellbound.",1
"To be understood it must be wrangled and tamed by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so. It would be a crime if we never got the opportunity to see what he does with King Lear. < br / > < br / > The supporting cast is noteworthy. He is flawed not because he is a Jew, but because he is human. < br / > < br / > Shakespearean language is wild and rambling, saturated in multiple meanings, word play and metaphor.",1
I'm hoping that the DVD will come out with extensive commentary. no character is free from flaws ; no character is evil. Radford is himself of Jewish descent and he has picked out the good and bad of all characters with delicacy and honesty. Michael Radford has done an excellent job bringing this difficult play to the screen.,1
Yet in my view the film is not anti - Semitic at all. The Merchant of Venice'is one of Shakespeare's better - known plays and is still regularly performed in the theatre.,1
"all in all i think that fans of cynthia rothrock will be very satisfied watching this movie. it's not like'yes, madam '!",1
Go right to this movie!,1
I finally got around and rented it.,1
"Thanks, Bill. Oversentimental in places? Sure, of course it is - and proud of it. If you like your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values then this'll work for you big time.",1
"Any individual sport would serve plot, because it's about the people. < br / > < br / > Bottom line.... Its a feel good movie. Rainy day with not much to do.",1
"It seems he loved them both. Rebekah Gilbertson, the film's producer, is the granddaughter of Vera Phillips and William Killick. It's not a full - scale biopic. < br / > < br / > In John Maybury's The Edge of Love, Thomas is played by the Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. Sharman Macdonald, who wrote the screenplay, is the mother of Knightley. All that is now forgiven. < br / > < br / > We begin in London during the Blitz. Writers'lives are an endless source of inspiration.",1
And I'll thank you to remember that. Go get charged up. < br / > < br / > It was really his movie.,1
"Both Disney and Bill Paxton did a fine job in conveying a story that is based in fact. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I believe you will too. Mr. Ouimet.",1
"Photography is superb, but story sometimes lumbers along. A storybook ending leaves a knot in the throat.",1
"I mean, Wow! I certainly was. I was blown away by this film. The score also did wonders ; excellent, excellent score. < br / > < br / > This movie was clean, too, which is a great plus. < br / > < br / > Even if you don't think would be your kind of film, watch it.",1
"This is first of all a good, exciting story, with well developed characters. And speaking as one of many who can't abide golf on TV, this is no small feat. < br / > < br / > Shia LaBoeuf playing Francis Ouimet is, as usual, callow and sympathetic. But all the other details are well crafted on top of that, leading to a wonderful film. But the real standout is Steven Dillane, playing Harry Vardon.",1
The movie is excellent. I am not a golf fan by any means.,1
"The stories converge at the 1913 Open. Francis undergoes some of the same prejudice as a boy in early 1900s Brookline. Ironically, Vardon is 2nd underdog in this flick! ), it's expertly done and immensely watchable!",1
The real life challenge for both father and son had been met.,1
Love it.,1
An easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dip in pace.,1
Oh some parts were funny and others I was just really happy. You did a awesome job. I hope most of that stuff you put in there was true also. Oh my god what a story!,1
"Despite what it may look to some on paper, The Greatest Game Ever Played is one of the best sport films in creation. He has not forgotten this life lesson. At 20 years old, Francis Ouimet ( Shia Lebouf ) as his whole life ahead of him - in a way.",1
It was overwhelmingly entertaining. Did a decent job. I had a great time watching it.,1
find a friend who does and watch it there.,1
Here is a movie that moves. That is not bad.,1
"As you know "" The Greatest Game Ever Played "" is about golf. The ways in which the golfers visualize the course offer more aesthetic enjoyment. A conflict between a son's wishes and a father's demands. The entire movie could've been told without dialog.",1
The movie was well done on all levels. A MUST SEE 5 stars.,1
"It's also a touching story of someone giving a little kid a chance. Wow, here is another great golf movie. In the film, Vardon is pictured as a warm, nice guy ; a genuine human being. < br / > < br / > Whatever.",1
The cinematography was fantastic. The visuals in this film are outstanding. He does well in this role.,1
"From there Vera meets Caitlin, Dylan's wife. She gives in. < br / > < br / > All four are performed very strongly. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas, and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. So does Dylan's infatuation with Vera. < br / > < br / > This movie is based on Thomas'writings about love and romance.",1
"It takes pride in what it does, and does it well.",1
And applause of my two sons. This movie earns the audience applause. But it still works.,1
"No magic here, it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner.",0
"And why the heck does he always play the exact same character? Generic and boring, there's really nothing worth watching here. 4 / 10.",0
There is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no - one. I did'nt like him right from the start. < br / > < br / > Stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours and 2 instead.,0
"But i fault everyone involved for turning out Lame - o performances. 3 stars, meh. This was one of the many ice - t movies i saw as a kid and loved, only to watch them later and cringe. I hand it to Walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location. Bottom line this movie is like domino's pizza.",0
"She really deserves it. But it is just window dressing, the historic context is completely negligible.",0
"Not to mention the "" romantic "" aspect ( oh, how sweet! ).",0
< br / > < br / > Our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father. This German horror film has to be one of the weirdest I have seen. His co - workers find out and tease him terribly.,0
"20th Century - Fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges. By the time of the big horserace finale, most viewers will have had enough. ).",0
Cage plays a drunk and gets high critically praise. Heck nobody could do it better. I literally vomited while watching this film.,0
< br / > < br / > This movie started out with the promising note of being such a film. I felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did. I felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event that never materialized.,0
So tell me - what serious boozer drinks Budweiser?,0
A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film. Incredibly bad.,0
No talent was used to make this film. This film is absolutely appalling and awful.,0
"< br / > < br / > Take for example towards the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains. He initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep.",0
GREAT job on the dubbing too guys (! ) Why not do that earlier? Lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. It's a mystery.,0
The Final Executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fans. Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust.,0
! Is this a film comedy? But it actually does not!!!,0
"* from * * * * She's delightful ; "" Happy Anniversary "" is not.",0
< br / > < br / > It also rates as one of 25 worst films ever made!,0
"It just does not works for a slasher flick. The woods setting, the killer, the dumb teens, the gore, etc. < br / > < br / > The acting is simply horrid. a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80's tunes?! The score is horrible! Thank God seems to have vanished from earth.",0
was OK until he started over - the - top sobbing like a baby. The Lord's dog? And I went from disliking Wilkinson's control freak / moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change ( unlike his wife ). But for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone. ).,0
"Steve Bond ( anyone < br / > < br / > remember him? ) < br / > < br / > Brown's direction, and the script he cowrote, both smell like the < br / > < br / > presents brown bears leave in the woods. is here in an early role as a victim. The climax has a hunky forest ranger trying to < br / > < br / > get to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzard < br / > < br / > bait. < br / > < br / > Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping.",0
"The Prey is one of those films. I actually thought this was quite an original idea. Sort of like Cropsy from The Burning, but better.",0
"1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies. """,0
Not too bad if I do say so myself. The ending still haunts me to this day.,0
"Let's somehow pad an entire feature around it. "" Deliberately! And... well, they did. So we get entire scenes wherein the actors are murmuring! Seriously, I've seen more dialog in a silent film.",0
"Apparently it was shot in 1978 already, but nobody wanted to distribute it up until 1984 and it isn't too hard to see why. The Prey "" is an irredeemable boring film. ).",0
"This is for slasher completists only. A bunch of horny kids are, of course, en route to this area for a debaucherous camping trip of there own. This is a far cry from Charlie Chaplin, but it was still nice to see him. On plus side, the wildlife footage is rather nice. Years later, campers are going missing from the area of the fire.",0
"Not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless, unnecessary nature footage. Still, it'business as usual for dead - camper movies. Although one might be more rewarded to watch Just Before Dawn ( 1981 ), Wrong Turn ( 2003 ), or even The Final Terror ( 1983 ) again.",0
"< br / > < br / > A true 1 out of 10. < br / > < br / > Leprechaun 4, Jack Frost and The Prey. The back of the box says "" The ending will shock and haunt you. "" The gore is horrible. Rented 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm room. All these extra shots were to make up for lack of a script and story.",0
The screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other. Now I wish I hadn't.,0
But ironically this was filmed before Friday the 13th. The prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But it has a dated look to it. The plot is your basic killer in the woods again.,0
"All the criticisms of this movie are quite valid! A couple exchanging nods over their "" good grub. "" Lots of seemingly stock - footage close - up shots of animals, birds, insects, and spiders in the woods. Quadruple - takes or more when people look at things. Solitary banjo - tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer. The killer evidently wasn't too satisfied by the axe he stole, and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or his bare hands.",0
For people who have bought this. I say this. This is no horror movie. Don't do it.,0
Thank God I didn't buy this movie myself!,0
How sick? You can really see it was cheaply made. I rate this film Capital F minus. It was a total disaster. I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It made you think he was dipped in fish batter. Then there were parts that were vulgar. I thought it was nasty and very strange. Instead of the mother leading her off it is the brother.,0
My family laughed at it. You won't be scared by this one.,0
Are you kidding me?,0
This is the 21st century. Go to college.,0
"I'm just telling it like it is. I really, really did. I wanted to like this movie.",0
There are facts that do appear in the book. There is no talent. The makeup is bad. Someone said I like this story. It is a whopping tale with him and his little problem. This is probably how this movie was put together. The bad acting really ruined the story. It has always fascinated me. When you watch this movie. First of all.,0
"However, it's not all bad. He throws up, but otherwise his stiff - upper - lip hardly quavers. Here, people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity.",0
The acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor. To knowledge this is the only eyewiness account ever penned.,0
"However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw! < br / > < br / > First, the acting. < br / > < br / > The setting for the plot is Robertson County, Tennessee. I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's chilling performance in Friday THE 13TH. A series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of John Bell and his family. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. And then some! It is painful to watch because it is just downright boring.",0
The dialog was tedious. What is with the comic relief moments?,0
I was raised by one. I have much respect for women.,0
Painful to watch ; I may have laughed once.,0
If I wasn't on a bus I would have walked out on the movie.,0
"This is one of those strange, self - important, self - indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. Some characters are more entertaining than others. So deep. It's a long trip, which drags in many places. It isn't. during Adam's travels through the Mojave Desert on foot. In fact, it's longest hour and a half movie I've ever seen.",0
"I view it as some kind of anti - personnel weapon. It's honestly that bad. If you are familiar with the term "" word vomit "" then you may get some picture of the cinematrocity. Oh, and the narrative structure is ill conceived, pretentious and amateurish. It has failed on both style and substance.",0
One would think there'd at least be some humor value... but not here. What if someone made a horror movie that was completely devoid of plot?,0
"Its amateurishness drips from every scene. The jokes are lame and predictable. The singing is "" schrecklich "". Why has this been such a huge hit in 1986? ).",0
But destiny is even crueller and Dame Angela meanwhile falls in love with a German!!,0
As someone previously noted soundtrack is haphazard and Kelsey Grammar is very wooden. This is a family movie that was broadcast on my local ITV station at 1. It also explains why DOCTOR WHO was such a successful show across the world. Come on there's nothing kids like more than sadism and that's why Roald Dahl was such a popular author for children. Can you imagine how much worse KINDERGARTEN COP would have been if the producers had gone all PC?,0
"The impression is that the attack was all for nothing. They knew how vital the battle was. Because the Remagen Bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks. < br / > < br / > This film has little to do with real history.",0
"Unless you are under 7 years old, I recommend watching something else.",0
Somewhere.,0
Don't be drawn in by the video box art of Jaclyn screaming while taking shower.,0
It makes it look like Halloween mixed up with Trick Or Treats. Avoid this. This is BAD cinema.,0
"We have to keep the characters and the time lines straight. Few of the faces are familiar and that doesn't help at all. Out of a sense of guilt, he tracks down the real murderer. ( Jacqueline de Bellefort?",0
"It is not an Agatha Christie movie. The music became more and more offensive as the plot progressed. I keep thinking of how it could be with the same cast, done the right way.",0
The acting was uneven. < br / > < br / > The plot has too many holes.,0
The movie is that bad!,0
< br / > < br / > You won't miss much if you skip this one.,0
Aya!,0
It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions. Lighting Bad. < br / > < br / > 4. Plot Bad. Watching The Adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal. Cinematography Bad.,0
"; the former ( who would go on to become an Italian TV personality ) seemingly has the ability to talk with the Little People (! ) which look uncannily like the tiny sisters from GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA ( 1964 )!! Narrative - wise, here we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus'seven all - important ( but poorly animated ) thunderbolts a crime which, for one thing, sets the moon careening on a collision course with Planet Earth! ; a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a SUPERMAN - like scrolling credits sequence.",0
< br / > < br / > Watch it & forget about it. You also get a SFX creature that looks like a poor man's version of some tier - IV Harryhausen monster.,0
"But then no one would need to see the film. < br / > < br / > ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports JP3 began filming without a completed script. < br / > < br / > Dave Even at that, I found myself frequently checking my wristwatch.",0
The story is so lame that had to be a outrageous sequel. This movie was so bad I thought for a minute it was Death Wish 4.,0
JP3 lacks the Spielberg touch.,0
"Tea Leoni... Not one moment of it is worth it. Sam Neil, no big deal.",0
"From the opening 10 minutes, I was ready to leave.",0
The introduction of a pterodactyl does not a great movie make.,0
It was the modern Jaws.,0
"It was all about "" Dinosaurs eat people. "" However, it was disappointing even on that level.",0
"I found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the dino embryos still locked in the shaving cream canister from Jurassic Park 1. We got several brief shots of the new species and only 2 really were involved in the action. To summarize, my group of friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorites gaffes, plot inconsistencies, untied loose ends, and other ridiculous aspects of this movie. The editing was poor and none of the characters engendered any sort of sympathy or feeling.",0
"* out of 4 stars. The bottom line is it's not a very good film, even as a thrill ride. < br / > < br / > The dinos look okay, though by now they're just standard fair and not very scary.",0
This gave me with no option but to award the film 3 / 10!,0
Fast.,0
Skip this and go on to 4th installment which I highly recommend.,0
That was about all there was to it. The special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars. I wouldn't even bother renting it.,0
"WRONG! This movie was going through "" the motions. """,0
* Phew * they will make this movie watchable right?... ! There are so many stupid things about this film it's mind boggling!! not a single explanation! OK i am not going to say anymore about the plot WRONG! NO!,0
you are just a big fony hyporite. I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. I would like for once see more black women then white.,0
"Weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. Thank you.",0
"Hence the sorry lot of judges, photographers, associations. Bad, bad, Tyra and crew. But Hence the name of the show. < br / > < br / > This is the dream of some girls, and good for them. Heck, I'm trying to see what happened to the ones that DID win, actually. In watching this I hope other girls that see this and run like Hades the other way - like to college.",0
I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season. It's called taste.,0
I couldn't laugh hard enough. As if modeling was doing great things for mankind. Please. < br / > < br / > And then there's the ubiquitous Ms. Banks ( as in laughing all the way to the... ).,0
What was their message? It was awful plain and simple. Where was the movie going with this?,0
Wow!,0
Populate it with a cast of interchangeable caricatures instead of actual characters.,0
The only problem was that they did not fit.,0
"Matt Dillon head of a mobster organization? Wow, I was really disappointed. It really should be a made - for - tv movie. The settings were nicely done. There was just no intimidation there. Come on, give me a break. What awful guitar solos, my god.",0
He vows to protect the neighborhood. < br / > < br / > The movie didn't really do it for me. In a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950's.,0
"A sense of sadness and regret permeates the production. This is definitely no "" Basketball Diaries "". according to the DVD sleeve description.",0
Must be tough... Worst acting too. Nothing to see. No acting at all.,0
I couldn't blame him if he did.,0
This one doesn't have a thing. Both Raptor and this came out. 2001 wasn't perhaps Eric Roberts best year.,0
"The first time we see him he's bare - chested, sweaty, and engaged in that favorite "" beefcake "" activity - - chopping wood. There are a few pluses, though. ( Note : the cast credits at the end aren't too helpful. Enjoy the opening credits.",0
Outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped. What did they come for? This movie lacked credibility for two reasons. Why did the outside gangs come to help?,0
"I was looking forward to this movie. Run out of ideas! ? they almost did. Trustworthy actors, interesting plot.",0
"Red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story, which is about where the movie ends. Raised in the old ways, Tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world.",0
"This movie tried to be a good suspense thriller, but in the end, it fell flat. Every actor in this movie did good with what they had to work with. You can real easily pass on this movie if you ever get the chance to see it. In that movie, she put her sexy voice to good use. I just watched this today on TV. < br / > < br / > If there is something good about this movie, it is the cast.",0
Getting drunk couldn't even help this video.,0
"awful, awful, awful. This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department. To right that woman.",0
"Very cheesy OK the box look interesting, the opening have great music and its kinda original, to that its all OK. Well lets just say this movie is a Z - series one and a very poor one.",0
whilst sat watching this pap.,0
"And of course the cats are a positive surprise. The soundtrack though, isn't to bad. Well, I was wrong. It most definitely don't deserve any recognition.",0
It may actually be an ironic look at bad horror films and I'm missing the point but I somehow doubt it. All in all this film has serious bowling shoe tendencies.,0
HAHAHA! And for that I pay it homage.,0
"A rocket launcher?! and new lows of misogyny : the movie contrives to desecrate every female character in sight, whether by rape, explosion or New heights of stupidity are reached here a machine gun? Tougher jails? Charles Bronson is back, blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbourhood. Well, okay.",0
I would have rated film 0 out of 10 had that been possible! What passable efforts in acting from this motley crew are totally undermined by a plot and script of especial inanity. It is embarrassing to see the once handsome leading man ( Fahey ) in corny makeup uttering bizarrely bad lines.,0
"< br / > < br / > Secondly, for a horror movie, it has no sense of tension or threat whatsoever. A cat gave it to her when she was holding it during an auto accident she had as a kid. Just as ludicrous is how Carol originally came to have the power to see how people die. We get the joke it just isn't funny ). < br / > < br / > On the plus side one moment is well done, the car crash involving Susan. WHAT???????? Not very atmospheric at all.",0
I have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one.,0
And they leave a corpse even though normal people can't see them because their dead?,0
It's a shame.,0
"And the dialogue.......... oh, how my sides ached!",0
"I think it would be a complete waste of time. It's hard and I didn't expect it... But it's really the worst film, me and my wife saw. Poor special effects.",0
How scary is that? I kid you not! This is truly one of the most awful movies of all time.,0
"And the opening credits were great, but don't be fooled! : / And what was up with the souls in space? Where do I start? < br / > < br / > Bah. It was semi - amusing at some parts. I give them props for that scene, it was good.",0
"It's the worst thing I have ever seen. "".",0
( * 1 / 2 ),0
It's also boring. Don't bother. - kind of way. But you don't know truly awful film - making until you have seen Darkhunters. Darkhunters does no such thing.,0
"4 out of 10, the viewers must be going crazy",0
"Yes, she is gorgeous. Dick Haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick (!",0
You would kind of think that Haymes would be playing Walker's role at least. It was awkward to say the least. < br / > < br / > Look at the names that went into this show. Of course on Broadway the songs were done by singers Mary Martin and Kenny Baker.,0
"Dick Haymes contributes a chorus. The only point of a musical, however, is to have music. Wonder what she thought about while she replaced or tweaked Ogden Nash's clever work. Ronell was no hack ; she wrote Willow Weep for Me. Speak Low "" is as great a love song as anyone ever wrote. It's a role Arden could play in her sleep, and she's good at it.",0
It's just too tired. I think I may have laughed once - and it was during the NGs.,0
I've always been a werewolf man myself.,0
"Next, the acting is just average.",0
"And, again, she's the HEROINE.",0
"It is so boring. So we stop watching it. This show might be one of worst comedy sitcom ever... "". But the show us such a disappointment.",0
I watched it knowing it would be trash.. I'm not kidding. 5! I can't believe it made it past 1.,0
"before selena gomez is showing her tits? how many more years? Wanna know why? Except a million times lamer. Do it sometime, Disney. Also, the writer of the show is inconsistent. It's called proofreading and editing. < br / > < br / > Hello?",0

6 ) The book is very complex. Why for god's sake? 3 ) Hastings finds the victims cause he is such a bad golf player. Totally unfunny and stupid. The movie takes only about 90 minutes.,0
"This is simply horrible. If I see few seconds of this horrible show the rest of the day is ruined for me. How come I can hear laughter, yet there's nothing funny happening? Pretty stupid, eh? The American way of laughing - track business makes the whole thing even worse. I simply can't understand what is so good about "" Reba "" that it has lasted for long a while in television. Thanks for your ( possible ) interest.",0
"The characters of Van and Cheyenne are also very annoying. Reba McEntire isn't even from this state, she's an Oklahoman! My parents may enjoy this show, but I fail to find the humor in it. She is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager! Absolutely nothing!",0
Barbra Jean is just too stupid. Reba gets 2 / 10. EVERYONE IS STUPID! There.,0
"< br / > < br / > As I understand it, Bronson disowned this film, but happily cashed the check from Golan Globus. < br / > < br / > Richie's brother Chuck ( from "" Happy Days "" ) with a reverse mohawk! Naked Deanna Troi!",0
Reba sucks.,0
but i just can't take Reba.,0
Towards the end its pretty bleak..,0
"As inconsistent as Reba's character is, it's hard for her to be believable. Does anyone else think that "" Reba "" is basically a ripoff of "" Roseanne ""? and being sweet and caring with little transition in between. < br / > < br / > And then, of course, there is the biggest similarity, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor. """,0
The jokes in the show are so lame.,0
< br / > < br / > The show is waste of time. Yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection to the character. < br / > < br / > Reba herself has no presence which is needed here to establish the fact that she is cast as the put - upon woman of which her entire family is centered.,0
Not to bad Hugh?,0
"Now I've seen it all. It was not to be! It is only 80 minutes... how many times must we look at that scapel like that before it consumes the whole movie?... And then to insult even further, there is a stupid super cop - out sub - ending and an even stupider final conclusion. The characters have negative IQs, which suggests they are not human.",0
"Whoops, we made a mistake. We finally decided on Last Slumber Party, THE. We decided to look in the low budget horror section. We could not find one since we have seen almost every movie created. We will just leave that to the imagination. The plot of this movie was ridiculous.",0
"At that time, Bronson was 64. I had to give it a 4. This movie gives you a sense of rejoice. Every time he blew one of them away I felt good.",0
Painful example of home - made horror. So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie.,0
Give me a break.,0
It seems as though it was made by a college student for a film class. We can only assume he had a Charlie's Angels fixation at one time. You sure couldn't tell that from the poor production values.,0

The killer knocks slices people's throats without anyone really noticing. And there were a lot of out of focus shots that didn't seem intentional. The apparent lead of the movie more or less sleepwalks through the movie. < br / > < br / > I saw this on videotape.,0
"this is a good one for friends, but i wouldn't recommend it for anything else. oh well... its funny. Don't really expect Hitchcock or anything close to this. this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie, the suspense, the shock, and good characters.",0
"This movie is HORRIBLE! ( Scary, huh? ) NO!",0
"This one's a doozy. < br / > < br / > For those who have outgrown The Naked Gun series, this is the funniest cops - n - robbers film going.",0
"Wasn't Uncle Wiggly a rabbit? What the heck does that have to do with anything? I kinda hate Dore Schary. Dore Schary was determined to bring more "" realism "" to movies. I guess I just don't get tough - guy Film Noir - ish kinda jargon. And oh yeah, there was a stripper, played by the previously wholesome Gloria DeHaven. So there are moments of truth in this film, underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is trying so self - consciously to be gritty and REAL, that it actually seems unreal to me. < br / > < br / > In fact, much of dialogue made me mutter "" nobody talks like that! "" I do believe they can be traced back to this movie. """,0

A family ( A teenage boy, his mother and a stepdad ), sick of city life, decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and have a fresh start. Their careers all hit dead ends. While having objects thrown through their window and being threatened in the street is just the start, the youth decides to make things even worse by having a relationship with the terrible trio's sister.

No - Veto on this sham try again. Finny is a character that does not have nor needs a last name. In the novel and 1972 film version there are sexual undertones everywhere in the writings and dialog. The Showtime 2004 film made for cable version was not.,0

And what was the point of having Melanie Griffith in this? I don't know what it is about Stuart Townsend. It uses elements from earlier and much better poker game based movies. It made the story such an unlikely one to watch. What a cast... and what a waste of it. Perhaps it are his looks, I don't known.

"The X - men spoof for example, or the whole farting sequence. Some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat. Again funny. The fault mainly lies with the gags. Even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. As a result so - called plot of these movies very rarely exist. Another flaw these movies have, is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! < br / > < br / > The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, THEN try and spoof them.

"< br / > < br / > I watched it on satellite ( thank goodness I didn't pay for it ), and wished I hadn't. Danes has no on - screen magic, and Ribisi's character is a goober that nobody would want to hang out with even if they were paid to do so. Awful movie if you ask me, and I generally have something good to say about just about any movie out there.",0
There wasn't any of that here. I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. Especially if you were fan of the TV series. It will be a complete letdown.,0
"Mr. Ribisi's portrayal is the most "" far out "", meaning he digresses most from the original characterization. and requests, "" Spin me! "" One white.",0

"This is just tedious. Mod Squad "" is dreary, tiring, and lethargic. I'm not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old TV show comes out. And Omar Epps looks like he wants to flee the set, but the script's chlostraphobia has trapped him. Giovanni Ribisi's acting extent in this flick is that Droopy the Dog look for an hour and forty five minutes.",0
There was not an original shred in this entire concoction. Bad cops frame good cops. Note to Claire : I hope this paid for your new condo. It can't possibly be as bad as ripping off bad television. Note to screenwriters : Buy one of those story generators. Everything.,0

He can't be a cenobites because he had nothing human. Bloodline is incoherent with the movie series in many ways.,0

I think not, and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film.",0
"An ambitious idea. Unless you're an "" Alan Smithee fan, avoid this one.",0
What happened to the evil that men do? Gone are the sick desires of humans. Really the film should have been retitled to give that characters name. In fact everything that once made Hellraiser so original has been trashed by this mess of a picture. Pinhead is not Alien. < br / > < br / > Shame on you Kevin Yagher and Alan Smithee.,0

"We watch, partly, because we want to know who dies. < br / > < br / > Without this complexity, the film emerges as a voyeuristic tale of youth sex and violence.

"The best performance was by gentleman playing Lin's father although much of his dialogue is in Chinese and subtitled. Operation Smile deserved to be honored by a much better movie than this!

What is this birth control nonsense supposed to do, titillate the audience?",0

"'Censored'is fairly weak by comparison. Despite all this, I prefer the Snafu shorts that go for jugular a little more, usually resulting in the death of the main character. For great examples of this, seek out Tashlin's'The Goldbrick'or Chuck Jones's'Spies '.",0

With such low expectations, how could I manage to be disappointed? This new character, Dick Harper ( a. k. a. Fletcher 2. Wait, no, this movie has no theme. I thought that was more of a given. 0 ) is a poorly rendered and miserably written whelp.",0
It was like a dark version of heartbreak high that needed a predictable ending. I don't understand what is hard hitting about this movie! And I needed a good laugh. < br / > < br / > Why?,0
Okay! So they start robbing a few places.,0
"As a big Jim Carey fan I took my seat in the cinema with optimism. After all, Fun With Dick And Jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another Carey success. Jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going. The actors seem confused with the situation as well.",0
"But since the viewpoint was done wrongly, the robbery part had to be limited. While this is good for drama, in comedy, we know the pains it need not be emphasized. I mean you can make many of these and put them in the movie. That movie was a serious one but the problems they faced were somewhat comical.",0
It was not James ( jim ) or Tea. Same should be done here. I thought the movie was sub - par. After that the movie could not recover. IMHO it was the music that killed it.,0
"And failing, miserably. Why?",0
"He is an unbearable presence on the screen. A satire about greed and money, what? Not anymore.",0
"Oh my lord, what were they thinking about with this one. Maybe she is just flat good as a crook. < br / > < br / > It truly is that bad a film. Any other time, wow, what a waste of time. Well, looks like it.",0
"), I would have done the same. < br / > < br / > The problem with the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be. I think it raised about five genuine laughs.",0
< br / > < br / > Dick & Jane turn to crime. < br / > < br / > Oops. < br / > < br / > Yay. See Dick work. Tea Leoni is frantic. < br / > < br / > See Dick get promoted. The script isn't funny.,0
"Fans of Jim Carrey should enjoy it but that's about it. He wasn't as annoying as most child stars are. The last one was Bruce Almighty which was pretty good. < br / > < br / > Next to Jim Carrey is Téa Leoni. They should have gone with someone else. Fun with Dick and Jane proves that he still has it. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. Rating 6 / 10 To be honest, I'm a little bias here. Part of the problem is the script. She's an okay actress but she just isn't very funny.",0
"At least the characters look like they tried hard to be somewhat different in that department. WOW, as hard as this movie tries to be realistic this is the most absurd thing I have ever heard.",0
No soup kitchens for him!,0
Rent this film and put your concerns to test.,0
"Well, that and a downbeat ending. cruises around in his van looking for victims.",0
"Those hoping for the likes of "" The Toolbox Murders "" or "" Maniac "" will be very disappointed. And what is with the killer's hilarious White Dude Afro? Can Psychologist Carol ( Susan Sullivan ) help, or will she become the killer's next victim?",0
< br / > < br / > there was nothing engrossing about this film. sadly this has none.,0
"< br / > < br / > I'm done with Dante, and done with MOH. I have family at Arlington.",0
"< br / > < br / > In the first, the package is really disgusting. Especially the stereotype filming and photographing. < br / > < br / > Zombie flicks are characteristic in plain, direct, unconventional and brutal cinematography. Nothing to be seen in Joe Dante's debut. THE ORIGINAL Zombie film was actually a midnight - movie named "" Night of the Living Dead "" ( 1968 ). You see, it is even not a horror movie.",0
"That's about as scary as it will get, people. Oh, and one of them finishes off The Doctor from Startrek Voyager. If you are looking for a horror - movie I suggest you keep on looking.",0
Why this story has made of a movie?,0
Give me a break!,0
"Closet homosexuality? ? How many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide? I couldn't relate to this film. Pfft, another cliché gets rolled out. The suicide is very graphic and heart - breaking to watch. But hey, where's the'entertainment'in that?",0
Homecoming ; what a HUGE disappointment!! ).,0
"< br / > < br / > The MOH series is quite uneven, and this is the very worst episode. Or have you ever seen a clever, subtle, intelligent liberal satire? Perhaps he felt he hadn't been overtly political before. I disagree with Dante portraying the Democrat - supporting zombies as creatures with an average IQ of 23.",0
My interpretation of this film is that the only war a liberal democrat could win is by having mindless Did Micheal Moore have anything to do with this piece of Garbage.?,0
"All that was missing was Caesar Romero as the President cackling in glee about how he orchestrated 9 / 11. Political satire should be clever, this however, pulls a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of an L. Ron Hubbard film. I had enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I came upon this infantile dung heap. It even takes a swipe at the Second Amendment and religion. < br / > < br / > Time get fitted with new tinfoil hats kids.",0
"In fact, it's hardly even horror. Why?",0
"Dear Mr Dante, < br / > < br / > Dude, seriously... the title of the show is "" Masters of Horror "". Appearantly you misunderstood the exercise.",0
Homecoming is about as fun as having a bear take a dump on you while you sleep. It's really too bad.,0
It's just flat out ridiculous. The last sentence of this review is a major spoiler. < br / > < br / > But this is pure crap.,0
"rant. C'mon! If Joe Dante wants to express his politics, let him go on Air America. Now I've got to watch this in horror movies?",0
"Such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans. What has he been up to since The Howling, after all? Maybe Dante really isn't a a Master of Horror, either.",0
"There's no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of "" I am troubled teen X, I have Y problem. "" < br / > < br / > Next, the ladies. But nothing new is revealed! This is blunt and HIGHLY sloppy storytelling.",0
I watch my horror films to be scared.,0
"Average at best, the film climaxes with a courtroom scene that's straight out of an episode of "" Perry Mason "" and is just as predictable.",0
"But then, it's true, I'm not too big into deep meaningfulness.",0
Thumbs down on this one for me!,0
"But this was truly, truly awful.",0
"Instead, what you get is Pierre et Gilles do Italy. Jarman appears to satirise the London art scene, showing it shallow and pretentious. But frankly, Jarman never strays beyond 80s caricature.",0
"Death? How about breaking bones? Somewhere between these is a really fuzzy line dividing "" acceptable "" from "" atrocious "". According to him, it was pretty close to mark technically. Heck, it wasn't even as good as "" G. I. Jane "", which is pretty sad.",0
( Well - not really! ),0
"She simply says, "" I picked him up on Waterloo Bridge. "" BETTE DAVIS has a nothing role in a bit part. Nothing bold there. The End. And it ends abruptly with Clarke losing her life during a bombing on the bridge.",0
The issues are still crucial but Boys From The Blackstuff cannot fully aid the cause of understanding the problems in Britain in 1980s.,0
"< br / > < br / > I cannot recommend It Started With A Kiss. And, the beautiful cinematography certainly makes the rich countryside of Spain seem lush.",0
It beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly. It is no understatement to call it far fetched.,0
Don't bother with this one.,0
"The red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch. I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a good time.",0
"This principle fully applies to "" The Devil's Triangle "", as it's basically a beautifully wrapped and enticing yet empty package. The cameras never at one point go underwater to explore the depths of the Bermuda area, for example, and the testimonies of the supposedly real - life witnesses of the dramas suspiciously look like staged acting scenes. After a couple of cases the whole formula simply becomes laughable and almost pathetic, but I guess it caused genuine mass hysteria back in 1974.",0
The makeup is horrifying. Chauvelin would never have a string of women in his bed. The dialogue is unbearable.,0
"Nice costumes, though. Although there is some good acting, the actors did not have much to work with.",0
The one with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews i preferred greatly to this.,0
Any other version is better than this one.,0
"Which brings me to another point, Sir Percy. So an idea dawned on me - Sink me! Not pre - revolutionary. Cleverest woman in Europe? I think not. His portrayal was most dreadful. There are movies which I have not watched! Chauvelin was too... foppish?",0
And in the middle of the FRIGGIN day!? The actors is at best mediocre.,0
Poor lady.,0
That story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. What a horrible movie! < br / > < br / >,0
"Richard E. Grant has done much better things, and < br / > < br / > Elizabeth McGovern's acting is uninspired and flat.",0
"Neither were the characters of Marguerite and Chauvelin adequately portrayed. So were Jane Seymour and Ian McKellen. In the previous versions, wit was the tool for escape, not technology. < br / > < br / > I much preferred the version from 1982.",0
"Now some people say that'as long as she's convincing who cares? < br / > < br / > But that is still minor to the biggest faux pas the film - makers made : having the dialogue in English. I tried watching this movie, but I didn't make it past the first 15 minutes. It totally destroys the mood, as well as any semblance of authenticity. For example, however good an actor Tom Hanks may be, he'll never be able to play an Australian Aborigine!",0
"Both Kristen K and Neve C played their rolls exceptionally. Though on a more positive note, the actors did a great job in acting in their roles. I wish the director and / or the screen writer had done his / her research in this topic.",0
"it just did not work. it all seemed like a rush to the finish. but, the movie was a let down. specially for neone who has seen'gadar '.",0
"Total failure! Yeah right The person who recommended it to me may now consider himself to be my personal foe! This movie was recommended to me, supposedly because it's raw, disturbing and thought provoking despite the low budget production values. The low budget factor is correct, but that about sums it up. "" Freak "" is dreadfully slow, poorly made and every character that gets introduced is downright insufferableand that includes the freak too.",0
"And to compare this to Halloween?! Even the title "" Freak "" suggests that this might be interesting. Rubbish! They are moving and hit the road. Yawn, that is my reaction to this film.",0
"Everything is so predictable. < br / > < br / > The biggest problem is that "" The Italian Job "" possesses no imagination at all. I've seen it all before and done better then. Even the heist and car chase scenes, supposedly the highlight of the movie, seem pretty ordinary. Must be a heck of a city for these things not to rate a response.",0
This is one of those films. Oh and the plot. Sometimes there's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe. Of course I can't help that I'm biased.,0
"Basically, I just view this movie as a major helping hand in the demolition of action buddy flicks. Well, this and Lethal Weapon 4... and Rush Hour 2... and The Man... That's pretty much the extent of the movie. My favorite scene is, I dunno, the car chase on the tracks, I guess.",0
"< br / > < br / > Direction on Santoshi's part is not up to par with the level the story demands. The film suffers from its jerky, episodic pace and its ending is rather too contrived. Mahima Choudhary puts in a laudable performance and continues to show that she is an untapped talent. But why? < br / > < br / > The female cast is given much kinder and more rounded characterizations than their male counterparts. One wonders how brilliantly she may have shone had the film been made by a director with the appropriate creative intention and appreciation of the issue at hand.",0
What on earth is Irons doing in this film? Have I been issued with the Special Edition naff version?,0
I shut it off. But this movie was badly written. Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors. so he's just a murderer.,0
Certainly not Serbian! A journalist like the main character ought to have known that. ! What kind of names are that?,0
"All through his career Hitchcock did great films ; this was not one of them. < br / > < br / > A man knows too much, his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence, and in the denouement all is resolved to the accompaniment of gunfire and rooftop drama. The camerawork is lively, the cuts are interesting, and the way that everything combines to a climax is masterly. < br / > < br / > What it is worth watching out for, however, is the sequence associated with the shooting at the Albert Hall.",0
"Hall "". Come to think of it, why was the note even written and secured in thehaving brush? Did Bernard have to refer to it every now and then to remind himself what was going to happen?",0
"Product placement gone wrong, so very wrong. I was really disappointed by this movie.",0
Save yourself time and watch c - span. It'll be more uplifting. There's not much more to say about this movie.,0
"The rest is pretty predictable. Naturally, they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture the men. 9.",0
Its a bad bad bad movie. Beyond that I'm speechless Its a turkey and the some.,0
No nudity or appreciable violence.,0
"It certainly isn't. Overall, a disappointment. < br / > < br / > One viewing is enough for this movie. < br / > < br / > Rating : 2 stars out of 5.",0
Her role was played well. I liked it. I rather enjoyed it.,0
"First of all, since I'm one of the people who never saw the MST3K chopped up version of this movie, I can't comment on that. Five is average to me and I think this movie is about average for a Sci Fi pic. Or if they have seen both cuts it seems they were greatly prejudiced by the MST3K viewing to begin with. In fact, I thought it was one of their better offerings.",0
The lucky kids to escape Joe look like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield. Wish I could say the same for this movie.,0
"5 for that, nothing for original. Her script isn't so bad, it's just bad directed.",0
"I've always wondered what the makers of the films lambasted on MST3K felt about their works being shredded ( not to mention how Best Brains acquired the rights ). First off, I've read the comments by the director further down and I'd like to thank him for offering his opinion. But anyway, if it's the case with Soultaker, it gets my sympathies. < br / > < br / > As far as cutting the film, it's been done before on MST3K, at least once.",0
"This is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring Charlize Theron ( oh pretty! Look at her pretty, wounded Bambi eyes, everyone! ) < br / > < br / > As expected for an American film of this sort, the movie began with a chase which wasn't bad. oh so pretty! which were thoroughly nauseating. Indeed, many of the action sequences are credible and this alone lifts the mark.",0
Quite a bit of gore.,0
< br / > < br / > 1 out of 10.,0
It's the Sooooouullltakaaaa! < br / > < br / > Wow.,0
In Satellite of Love : this movie is excellent!,0
I don't know what is more shocking. Yeah!,0
We quickly learn what Soultaker's role will be in this movie. Soultaker was written by and starred Vivian Schilling. < br / > < br / > The story and acting are decent.,0
"Though it sounds like I hated this, I didn't. PG 13 for language, violence and nudity. < br / > < br / > My rating : * 1 / 2 out of * * * *. Who really cares. 90 mins.",0
And why did he feel urge to use caps lock so much?,0
I don't blame writer / lead actress for being who she is. < br / > < br / > But it is still not a very good movie. I've seen this movie in the MST3K form.,0
"This is a woeful Hollywood remake of a classic British film. More like Italian Jobbie. Believe me, it feels like an awful long time before they do.",0
"Soultaker is technically what you would call the movie that was meant to be good. But since Zach is in upper lower class and Natalie is in middle class, it just ain't gonna work.",0
"Please, don't watch it. Trapped. Why do I acknowledge its existence? < br / > < br / > Why am I reviewing this film?",0
"I really tried to like it. This isn't worst movie in the world. "" It is very irritating to watch this kind of movie. So sorry.",0
I totally agree. The acting isn't bad. But those rubber bats just reduce it to standard fare.,0
"The persistent'grey'spaces throughout the movie were irksome. All in all, the movie was not really worth watching.",0
There's no real surprise anyway. More die in the cave. They start dying in cave. They go in the cave. They get stuck in the cave.,0
"None of the events are even slightly plausible and it looks like the entire cast is competing with each other to deliver WORST performance. The Cave "" got released more or less simultaneously with the English film "" The Descent "", directed by Neil Marshall. Very much NOT recommended! "" And we all hate that, don't we? Hideous winged creatures, that also happen to be parasites, soon attack them and escape seems impossible due to a landslide. I've seen better special effects in anonymous B - movies already, the filming locations aren't used to the fullest and the ending downright sucks!",0
< br / > < br / > So you'looking for a creatures - in - cave movie? Check out The Descent instead. The kills are boring 2. You'll forget who lived and who died for 2 reasons : 1.,0
Worst thing I have seen in years.,0
Dire! < br / > < br / > Thanks Bruce.,0
"An embarrassing production. Includes cameos from Pepsi, Dell, etc.",0
Why does he live in a cave? Plase shoot me if there is one. The tagged on ending made me wretch.,0
< br / > < br / > I guess you get the point by now. Yet I know plenty of people who will still see a movie if it's exciting. Atmosphere ruined. The creatures hiding amongst the darkness are supposed to invoke horror. The music for one is terrible. I'd like to say that about the Cave but I'd be lying.,0
"4 miles underwater to a spot even more remote, where they find salamanders, giant albino moles (?? ) Unoriginal looking CGI creatures are not impressing anyone in this day and age. Utilizing shakycam and quick - cut editing for your horror scenes is simply lazy, unimaginative film - making. The opening sequence serves no purpose whatsoever other than killing a few minutes and adding to the redundancy. Otherwise, it's business as usual. < br / > < br / > 4. ) It takes itself far too seriously and has no sense of humor whatsoever.",0
"There were too many close ups. Sounded intriguing!! But this movie is definitely a below average rent. The "" monsters "" needed more face time.",0
"It knocks off girls in any old order - you genuinely have no idea what to expect next - surely not her! Where the two are so different is that The Cave is unreal, entirely unbelievable, more Alien - esquire sci - fi fantasy adventure than horror, or drama. How unfortunate, yet also fortunate, that two films about pot - holing - The Cave and The Descent - should arrive at much the same time. Lots of water, caverns, danger... then ultimately some vicious human - like or human - derived creatures determined to prey upon them.",0
"No. Her scream really If they really believed he was a friggin'monster, then why not act like it? I went to see this movie to kill some time. Same here. The women are too hot for their jobs, let's face it. Everybody just talked about how he's "" changed "" and that he should not be the leader of group anymore.",0
5 : Apocalypse '.,0
What a terrible waste of my time it was.,0
"Apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls. Now I do. All in all, lots of noise about nothing.",0

"This is the rough. Since the disaster money shots are worthless how is the rest of the film? Two, count them, two employees staff the entire dam, all three shifts. < br / > < br / > The dam is also somewhat understaffed. Where do I begin?",0
The dam control room looks like cardboard. < br / > < br / > The effects are beyond a joke. Pathetic in almost every way.,0
This is definitely his forte and acting is not.,0
"The camera - work is erratic at best. < br / > < br / > One note of caution, however.",0
This is barely watchable.,0
There was better chemistry between him and Liv Tyler in Armageddon.,0
I give it three sleepies!,0
"The script had very few funny lines ; there was no physical comedy ; it was boring. Steve Zahn was good, as always. It will onlypoil a nice trailer. If you saw the trailer for the movie and liked it, as I did, my advice is : don't go to the movie.",0
"Who is to blame for this inept, ugly morass? It is tailor - made for bottom shelf at your video store. - - shout for Affleck to strip and start digging out their cash ). It is so badly edited, when I looked in the credits it wasn't to read the editor's name - - it was to see if the person actually took the credit! It's a small moment but it's typical of this film, an amateurish piece of pop - goods that wants to be an edgy modern comedy but doesn't have any guts.",0
"I had nightmares of this movie ever since I saw it. This is, without peer, the single worst movie that I have ever seen in my life.",0
The acting was horrible. It's LAME!,0
A turkey! Sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending. The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson ( geddit? ) This film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches.,0
"First up, the acting is awful. For the whole movie. "" It is awfully written. < br / > < br / > Etc. Many reasons.",0
"I wouldn't recommend this not even to the biggest Bradly hardcore fans. The poor director who oversaw this, "" tries "" some humorous (? ) That's coz every time I tried, I fell asleep. If they don't, they're stranded there forever. The movie follows up with David Bradley teaming up with some Earth girl for the rest of the flick.",0

Shocking.,0
"Do yourself a favor and revisit the real stuff instead. I hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest, dullest kind.",0
One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. I could find nothing to redeem this film. It is quite simply rubbish. Vinnie Jones accent is bizarre. ).,0
"Another major problem in "" Hell Ride "" is Larry Bishop's very own tremendous and seemingly insatiable ego. That's it, seriously! The plot looks complex but can actually be summarized in one sentence.",0
< br / > < br / > A lot of movies have been claimed to be sexist but if any movie deserves that title it's this one. < br / > < br / > I hope to never see Larry Bishop in front of the camera again.,0
Slap in the chops for me. The worse film i have every seen. Completely unrealistic.,0
That's what I kept asking myself while watching this film. However I couldn't have been more wrong. My advice : hire a different movie.,0
"Even an appearance by Dennis Hopper in full Easy Rider swing, couldn't save it. The three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable. Many have compared this to Tarantino's work. It is not even close. Yawn! Poor Eric Balfour tried his best but with such poor material it got lost. The dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies.",0
"Even the soundtrack was very annoying. I am very surprised to see the good ratings for this movie. I really like his movies. So I went to "" Beyond Rangoon "" with big expectations.",0
Has to be seen to be believed. This film is so bad it's hilarious. ! I notice it isn't listed here as a comedy so they must be serious!,0
"You see shot after shot directly on a girls asses. If you're eleven - years - old, you will probably like it. Its one of the worst movies I have ever seen. How this crap was even funded is beyond me. I shouldn't even be writing one. Stay away, stay very far away.",0
etc. Did they really need the Easy Rider motif too? Nothing in this movie is believable.,0
"But it's not edgy. If this movie can make newer generations interested in 60s and 70s films, kudos for it. The dialog tries to be clever and fails. The references seem forced. I do believe there is a place for style over substance.",0
Lots of boobage and hot scantily clad babes. Because that's what Hell Ride pretty much is. It's just post - Tarantino quirk.,0
Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film.,0
"< br / > < br / > This movie absolutely horrible. Or that's what the filmmakers would like you to believe, anyway. ).",0
"The leader, Pistolero ( Larry Bishop ), is hell - bent on revenge and putting out fires. And because Bishop's main influences are the talky films of Tarantino, there are a lot of them.",0
Definitely the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. She was really that annoying!,0
"Still not a good movie, just way misunderstood. The main character does not know she is seeing ghosts and neither does the viewer. hello!?! The fact that characters kept disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back to look, should have been a dead giveaway. First of all, just let me say this... Ghost Story....",0

There's something going on in this film directed by X - Files scribe John Shiban that has eluded me. It never gets a proper answer and I for one was a bit clueless at the point. It's about perception.",0
"In my opinion, any film that requires this much investigation to make itself ( only partially ) understood is not particularly a good one.

Her boyfriend Jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still weren't painful enough, if you ask me. Young couple on the road, minding their own business and having casual sex in their car during broad daylight. It's very sadistic and nasty, but every teenkill - slasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays, so that's no real surprise anymore, neither. The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots. Nicole's boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in California. Hmm, where have I seen this premise before?",0
"REST STOP may very well be the worst out of those. I mean, all we have so far is Joy Ride, Wolf Creek, Jeepers Creepers, Monster Man - among others. This movie is so unoriginal that it is flat out boring.",0
But I kept getting let down. I won't spoil it for you. B - rated movie quality.,0
"My attention ends up being occupied by plot holes and over - dramatizations, not the story. < br / > < br / > I don't know about you, but that doesn't work on me.",0
"This is the "" trifecta "" of bad move making and the reason the film was direct to video.",0
Even the soundtrack is awful!,0

"Christine, The Dead Zone and Cujo were all released within a few months of each other. I've read the book and it is quite disappointing - certainly for King - so it's hardly surprising that the film version amounts to so little. She's been having an affair with a local worker, and is now dwelling on whether or not to leave her husband. If pushed for an answer I'd say Cujo - marginally - is the weakest.",0
"Is that it? The premise is imbecilic, too banal, even for a horror film : a rabid mutt attacks a family. I think even Cujo must have sensed that he was starring in turkey. Mutts have terrible agents...",0
"However it might have been something new when King wrote the novel. "". I noticed a reference to the change in the ending. < br / > < br / > After the 40 minute mark point, something finally happened. There was nothing to indicate why this dog would go on a killing spree later. It began attacking some people. The dog suddenly transformed from a lovable pet into a vicious killing machine.",0
"The only good thing was the action scenes with the dog looked real, even though they were dull. It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life. Jaws is exciting and unpredictable. It however lasts too long ( half the film! ) Why? Cujo does neither. Great - simple plot for a good fun camp 80s horror. < br / > < br / > Uhh.. no. This in my opinion is one of the worst! But it wasn't. < br / > < br / > Films ended now, and it didn't get any better.",0

I only laughed a few times. This movie was extremely boring.,0

First things first, I am by no means a picky movie watcher. < br / > < br / > J Luda's character was such a cheap ploy for laughs, which fell extremely short of its goal. I saw it on TV and just didn't know what I was watching.",0
"Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. It is worth watching for the great concept and voice acting. After that, the joke wore thin. < br / > < br / > I give this movie a five.",0

"Get a grip, amigo.",0
The good news that apparently only 18 people have seen it. I suppose that makes me the 19th. More than three quarters of the dialog is inaudible. < br / > < br / > That's honest truth. It doesn't matter how scenes are shot because they don't add up to a story. It looks like people involved with this movie are stuffing the ballot box to boost its ratings.,0
This is a pretty simplistic romance.,0
But in fact women is obsessed with the man and wants him back. Failing on most occasions. The women I don't think ever went to acting college.,0
I don't recognise the external.,0

This movie lacks in everything.,0

i waste my time on this. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make such a movie? at least he can act! The end was the most pathetic! Bobby deol is good.,0
The cliches and stereotypes tumble over each other. The rest gave me indigestion. There is enough of it in my own family.,0

The plot is a twisted make of several films at best. I am sorry to say that I was taken to the cleaners. I wouldn't waste your time on this one.,0
This was an extremely stupid movie. Only a few laughs were to be found. His dialogue sucks too. At least zombies look cool.,0
"THEY DIDN'T! This movie baffled me. When I picked up the box, I thought : ZOMBIE WESTERN! No? FYI. This is the new number 2 on my list of Worst Zombie Movies Ever. I don't get it??? They DIDN'T!",0

< br / > < br / > To put it simply the movie sucks. If you're not... better look for other rob zombie films.,0
"< br / > < br / > Still it's not a completely horrible movie. Well, here we have a zombie movie that perhaps isn't even being much of a zombie movie. And why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place.",0
"The zombies are put together quite poorly. As Ryn uses the chum to collect a plentiful bounty from Lost Hills, all hell breaks loose. We later learn that these fingers are collected for bounties. < br / > < br / > And cue the awfulness of movie.",0
"They do it in other movies so I should do it here! "" < br / > < br / > Maybe a good view for burgeoning cinematographers and colorists ( first - year film - schoolers ). Does it fit here?

"He didn't particularly like the woman, that is clear from a few sources. < br / > < br / > But LA Confidential was a far better film. I'm not sure he ever even went back to Australia after his breakout success in Captain Blood. I could see that a lot of the film was based on that and upon reading between the lines of that book.",0
This film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts. Flynn was never tried of manslaughter or murder.,0
Very disappointing.,0
"Pearce IS Flynn! But movie caused a mutiny at the box office and unlike The Bounty, sank without trace. It is not often that the casting of someone so famous is so exactly right.",0
"I say NO to one. Can the reference to the Austen classics'Pride and Prejudice'and'Sense and Sensibility'be anything else? I'm sorry, but I don't think so. I rarely write a panning review, but here goes. How much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars? < br / > < br / > These actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films.",0
The entire film rings hollow. < br / > < br / > Pathetic.,0
"The last 20 minutes were particularly painful. And not even in a "" so bad it'good way "".",0
"Let the thing run ; you won't miss anything. The people are agreeable, even the obligatory flamboyant type. Its title promises far more than the film delivers. This is an interlude with no structure. The same comment applies to a really odd and unconvincing camping trip.",0
"Director J. S. Cardone presents something a little scary and a little creepy, but nothing more.",0
"OK, so this film is well acted. All the romance and relationships you hope would happen don't.",0
"It's awful. He lives by the catchphrases these courses expound. < br / > < br / > Every scene is too long, and are very repetitive. It is poorly constructed, lame and way wayyy too long ( 111 minutes for a comedy that should barely have scraped the 80 minute mark ).",0
This woman is a terrible comedian. She can't crack a joke. Not at all.,0
Time to leave! Couldn't stand it anymore. So I was not very much gripped by this film!,0
I hated it.,0
"I got to the point where I didn't care if they destroy the building or not. The short I will commend it in only one respect.. it was innovative. And there's also the protagonist. < br / > < br / > Anyway, it'rubbish. If I had to hear that girl's annoying giggle one more time, I swear I would hurl the DVD out the window.",0
( Was there even a story? ) Big waste of time.,0
For the fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy. Why do they keep putting this sort of stuff in movies? The movie its story isn't too well connected and build up within movie. he just keeps trying unfortunately. As an horror movie this simply is a very poor one.,0
was there even a plot?,0
"But have you already seen Delicatessen, there is nothing new it this film.",0
"You know, this is one of those "" Emperor's New Clothes "" films. Weirdness does not, in of itself, mean something is interesting. Well, I think that's a bunch of bologna. Films like this which hide under the cloak of Dada or surrealism make me nuts.",0
"They are wrong! In comparison, the one of the "" Shining "" is funfair!",0
Some manage to do so with great talent. It seems to be a common thing in the 90's to play with cliches. Every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater. Hervé Hadmar doesn't.,0
IT IS HILARIOUS! Acting? It is the perfect template for how to not make a movie. The audio is often not legible. I saw this on cable. Hmmm.,0
Avo it at all costs.,0

They're dead already - - why do they need food? It has a few saving graces. Cut to 2006. He was around the area. This starts off in Pennsylvania in 1913. You can skip this one.,0

"In releasing the DVD, Edwards cut 19 scenes ( 19!!!!!!!! ) We are 25 minutes into it and we still don't know what's going on or why we're watching what's going. How powerful is she? from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version. < br / > < br / > Boy, what a terrible film.",0
It is that bad. !,0
The worst part was that I had to watch it so many times. Also don't expect new movie to be any better.,0
"Could it be the Fang Lady ( Justin Hamilton )? I'd imagine the budget didn't allow the filmmakers to show it. There are a few lame attempts at humour which don't sit that well along side the horror elements & what was that retard keeping in that cage? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers, who knows?",0
This film is terrible - honestly.,0
"Yes, it's a SBIF ( So Bad It's Funny ) classic.",0
The lighting was poor.,0
"The movie just ticked me off. The addition of the fox was pointless, as well as the scene with Mattie trying to kill herself. The book more accurately describes Zeena's tyrannical control of the house and of Ethan.",0
"< br / > < br / > The character changes in Mattie and Zenna are almost non - existent. Joan Allen was also wonderful, however her character was much watered down from Whartons novella. This is never presented in the movie, they show it as if it were a sledding accident. < br / > < br / > Neeson and Arquette are superb in their portrayals.",0
"OK. Let me first state that I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this film. Most of the time, shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing. Uhhhhhhh. The crazy pretty boy who sniffs people like a dog?",0
"With the help of a grizzled neighbour, Karen attempts to end the curse before her & her children become the next victims. Once night falls, the Tunnys find out the reason behind the vanishings : a group of zombie children, killed in a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago, come out to kill anything that goes in the woods. Once arriving, they find that the house is very old & in need of repair. Wicked Little Things ( known in Australia as "" Zombies "" ) is a rare find a film that promises one thing but delivers another. ).",0
It makes no sense.,0
I'll give credit to ants. Why?,0
"Only 1 more phase until final credits! "" I guess they just couldn't afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly.",0
"You will 'over and over, but it is all quite simple. Not even in the distance! I can't think of any anyway. It is deffo more of a chiller. You may well say to yourself'how the Hell do they get the ants to do that? You never find out what they want. Did you notice that there are only six actors listed in the credits? It ain't a sci - fi because the'cosmic event'explanation is too vague to be properly taken into account. This is a plainly obviously low budget film which is a bit watchable because you probably won't have seen one like it.",0
I'm glad I didn't pay to see'The Wog Boy '.,0
Perhaps I just couldn't relate to it enough. I'm just glad I went on cheap tickets.,0
"God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back! Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.",0
"With such dubious talent responsible, I didn't expect much from Wicked Little things.",0

"Here however he's just plain irritating, unconvincing and I lost count at the number of times he mugged for the camera. It has also given us watchable films such as BOOTMEN and THE ODD ANGRY SHOT. I'd never heard of him and seen nothing else he's been in so perhaps he's much better at other performances. ... BREAKER MORANT and ROMPER STOMPER.",0
"Writer / Director Charles Martin's dialogue is neither witty, subtle or interesting - and there's so much of it. Characters in this movie fall in and out of love with each other, and move in and out of apartments, at a moment's notice only to move what little plot there is forward. As it is the characters just come over looking like selfish, petulant idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them. ( usually after someone has made a faux - pas or jumped to the wrong conclusion ).",0
"He's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. Others don't clear that bar. Yes, of course she did. "" There have been better sitcoms on television. Ha ha.",0
Who wanted to see this? Many scenes feature a shrieking baby.,0
What's that cliché? Maybe Mother dying soon after? I decided to watch this movie because I'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. Only the acting of the four main players was adequate.,0
"Aw, poor NYC lawyer!",0
Pick out those seeds or spit them out or swallow them - and then enjoy watermelon - life itself. When I bought 4 DVDs for £5. As many other commentators have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesn't quite convince. 'to live by.,0

"No. What it means overdone plots make people laugh. The Scary Movie franchise proved that, and Oldboy proved it as well. Simply put, it isn't there. Does that mean I'm a desensitized freak without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me? I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance.",0

"Then again, maybe this film was just bad. The word laughable comes to mind. < br / > < br / > And plot? cannot be used as an explanation for everything. Throughout all the fight scenes I felt myself cringing at how painfully cliché it all was. This movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake.",0
"It's pervasive violence, its live octopus eating and it's unimaginary story.",0
Forced acting. There's a thin line between being theatrical and being just plain forced. Forced plot. Forced takes.,0
The ending in which Dae - su goes to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotised feels tagged on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending.,0
This movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life.,0

The film is rife with totally unnecessary violence. < br / > < br / > 4. Psychological truth and logic are sadly missing. I cannot put any other construction on the ending. To me the film was poor entertainment primarily because of point 2. Absurd casting. What for? Some films apart from being entertaining are also thought - provoking.,0
I don't blame him for it either. J. S. Cardone attempts to get the horror fans back on side with shocks and gory scenes ( mostly involving kids ) but its not enough. The plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters that move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband. Chloe Moretz is slightly better than the usual child actor. Well I guess he felt that this one was too similar to his silly zombie fungus movie'Mortuary'and so turned this one down.,0
"This movie was awful, plain and simple. He is then abruptly released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him.",0
"By Jove, what an unholy mess! ( For by far deeper insights into human sufferance under mental sickness, without "" Oldboy "" s vulgar excesses, I recommend an older Dutch / French movie, "" The Vanishing "". ) eats a live octopus benefits greatly from the vivid presence of the best actor in entire cast : the octopus itself. Add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. In fact there is.",0
"After watching the first 30 minutes, I became both disappointed and curious. Fortunately, I haven't seen this film in a movie, big screen, just on a small screen on video.",0
"Avoid this non - scary, pitiful little excuse. Our hero is a dirty living college student who is doing research into the occult.",0
The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics.,0

Kill! I really wanted to like this movie.,0
I'm still not really sure what to make of it. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. I was wrong. And then there's the ending. The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.,0
"If you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this one. ! Oh, I see that I have to fill 10 lines or more. Pheww... one more line about a useless movie... Oh, I'm done. The Cavern is one of those.",0
A virtual carbon copy of The Cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot. Overall not worth wasting $ 4. 50 to rent.,0

"I can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets LSD. I spent half the film asking my teenage daughters what was happening, but they couldn't follow it any better than me. I haven't laughed this much in a long time - or seen a film so ineptly made! < br / > < br / > And what'with the early campfire scenes with the shot, after shot, after shot panning from behind the camp lights.

"Showing near total blackness for half the film really brought that home. I would be willing to overlook this if great heights of suspense were reached but this was hardly the case. but in the end its just some dude with a fur draped over him and a mask? Almost absurdly bad I thought. I have read that this movie gave a real representation of caving and yeah, I imagine that caves are dark. Sometimes a film is soo bad you can appreciate it and maybe have a laugh, but this films fails to take itself lightly as well.",0
"I am a grown man, pretty big, and I can defend myself well. Since I can't do that, I will just complain about it. This was absolutely idiotic. I generally love this type of movie.",0
"There turns out to be no reason for the reporter. all I got at the end of it was a £10 coaster. I was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing. The monster then kills one of the women If I could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating I would. They then find a picture of a kid. When they get in the cave, they can't get out and they get killed off one by one by a monster.",0
I'm still not really sure what to make of it. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. I was wrong. And then there's the ending. The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.,0
I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed.,0
This film is a crime against humanity. The person who wrote the summary and rave review for this film is either an idiot or an avid fan of shitty movies.,0
"Any movie that ends with a rape scene is awful. I'm really mad, I want my money back and my time back. AWFUL!",0
"However, The Cavern chooses instead to introduce elements that work at first, only to be negated by it's own lackluster storytelling. < br / > < br / > I'll be honest with you, if you want a claustrophobic caving horror movie go watch "" The Descent "", and I feel weird saying that because I didn't particularly enjoy that movie either.",0
"Maybe, maybe not. I think I'm pretty well done with cave movies at this point, 2 out of 10. And what is it? If that's the case than this should be the scariest movie made. Poor lighting?",0
I also noticed that many people gave this a positive vote for being so realistic as far as what it's like inside a cave. ( Ex. We started DVD and it all started out fairly normal. Look at the top rated films of all time for the complete list. ),0
The camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up. I can't blame what I don't like about this film on its low budget. It just wasn't necessary. It must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this film.,0
"When one does collapse causing a cave in all the children die, becoming zombies. There's 2 scenes that may cause an unexpected jump.",0
Made on a budget somewhere in the vicinity of $ 1. I'm your friend. Stay away from this movie.,0
"I expect unreasonable things, like aliens, demons, or good acting! Sixth Sense does - it explains a lot. Please. I don't care if that's what it would'really'be like, I did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things! Hide and Seek did, too.",0
Film also requires light to work. You might have wanted to start with spelunking. < br / > < br / > Now on to the screenwriter. Try to make at least one character likable.,0
Movies shot with handy cams look better then this. Possibly the worst movie I ever saw. It also covers up the crappyfx. It is way to dark.,0
"( I was watching alone too ). Truly horrible. I kept thinking what a waste of film every time it happened - yes, it does happen more than once if you can believe it. However, this movie takes that to the extreme. Dumb, dumb. Way too dark in some areas.",0
"< br / > < br / >... one of the worst movies I've ever rented. It doesn't make any sense. There is no story, no character development, no scares, and no good lighting.",0
"That's not remarkable. < br / > < br / > The movie has no redeeming qualities, save one : it's consistent. Toss Karo syrup on them. Now all of you start screaming and yelling at the top of your lungs. That's it. Everything is terrible. Making a crap movie on a HUGE budget is remarkable ( Waterworld ). It was the first clue that I was going to hate the movie. Now have a guy in a gorilla costume enter the room and rape the last person standing. And boring.",0
"He's a fine actor, anyway. There just isn't a lot to say about it. That was a surprise. It's always been called "" Scar. "" Tense "" is not an accurate adjective for this film.",0
"But no, they were actually muttering their script lines. The drill sergeant is about the only believable character while everyone else seem to be just cardboard cut - outs. Is that normal behaviour? Nothing... < br / > < br / > Then we have the Vietnam - part. Then the camp is besieged. Were the Vietnamese all suicidal? The rest of movie continues with even more completely illogical war scenes.",0
What a none eventful man he was. And it was boring. Zombies don't appear to have that much energy in other films. Cliché weird man in the woods who no one believes.,0
"She is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone. François takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed. < br / > < br / > I was annoyed when I saw some animal torture scenes. François murders him in the name of defending his father's honour. Indeed she appears to be angelic and beautiful. The war has not done well with him, he has changed.",0

"The character Belphégor is one of his best known creations. She has now however dropped back again to movies like this one. You can say that the movie is even a bit boring. It would had actually made the movie a better and scarier one to watch, no doubt about that really. The first movie got released way back in 1927, simultaneously with the novel. It's not like the special effects are bad in this one. < br / > < br / > The editing seems totally off. This is mostly the reason why the movie just doesn't work out on any level.",0
"All they do is kill a pig, that'it. < br / > < br / > Instead, the movie flashes forward to present - day. A single mother and her two bratty, foul - mouthed kids. The opening scene is the only watchable scene in the whole movie. This seems to be setting up the premise for an interesting movie. It was unbearably boring to watch.",0
It is so slow Slow and uninteresting. Mostly the movie is made for the British audience.,0
"This was a pretty dull movie, actually. ( So THAT'S how people keep stealing the Mona Lisa! )",0
Detective Verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief. Soon enough she's stealing the museum's Egyptian treasures out from under their nose.,0

In fact Belphegore 2000 owes much more to the new Mummy films than to the old series. They were right.,0
They're all horrible. 3 / 10. Then thing kills all 5 ( or however many of them there are ). But they can't stop it. So they call in the navy. Stay away from this movie.,0
"He then smuggles it aboard a cruise ship where two members of the crew let it loose. It was hilarious. They should get medal for coming up with that. OK, its a movie it can happen right? Toward the end she goes all martial arts on the monster and kicks his butt.",0
If this were direct to video you would find it in 99 cent bin. Puleeze. No dramatic Helicopter drop of the Navy Seals here.,0
All in all however the movie was soo bad it was funny. ?,0
"Enough said.. was below standards, even for a fan.",0
"Join the Captain, Isaac, Gopher and Julie in a fun - filled Halloween Special. < br / > < br / > The Marines respond. Yay for Little Stupid! Captain Stupid is powerless to stop it.",0
"Again, the producers decided not to spend for decent gore effects. The blood looks damn fake! It's an actor in a Halloween outfit please! ! Not even if it airs on cable. Don't expect even a hot girl in this one. The ending is a very poor scene that won't leave you satisfied. This crap makes "" Demon Slayer "" look like "" The Exorcist "". Chupacabra Terror "" is one of the worst B - Horror movies ever made. Plesae, don't even watch it even if you have the chance.",0
The other actors have a great excuse. Chupacabra falls into the not so fun B movie side with a thud. You know the ones with air holes that make every adult who wears them look like a complete tool. Up till then there was a lot of bad movie baggage but the Seals They are wearing bicycle helmets painted black.,0
"Shame on JRD! The cgi ship was bad and the creature looked like a large 5 foot bat. Who funded this project? Mr Sheppird was. Just been on sci - fi channel UK, 5th July, its was * * * *.",0

"It doesn't behave like one either. The Navy Seals that show up from nowhere repeat the pattern of shooting at everything. The special effects consist mostly of scenes of gory dead or dying bodies. I found this movie to be a big disappointment, especially considering the cast. A typical unimaginative slasher flick. A dart gun that works were mere bullets fail.",0
"The problem I had with the movie is the lack of creativity when dealing with the zombies. Anyone could just run away in a straight line to safety. Totally unbelievable movie. Son, go start the car. Cool.",0
"What this movie has going for it is, it's VERY fast - paced and lively ; you're never bored or waiting for another kill. Unfortunately, nobody else does. It's your stereotypical "" moster - run - amok "" movie on a cruise ship. The scary thing is, he's actually pretty damn good in this movie.",0
"This is one of those movies. My rating is based on Rhys - Davies, Simmons Neal.",0
"Well, the Sci - Fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out... and they seem to get worse every time.",0
< br / > < br / > Why? But at least he did show up. I expected Mr. Crabs and Sponge - Bob would show up at the end to battle the Chupacabra. It would have been a good film for a Leprechaun - like character. The acting is incredibly poor.,0

Let's start with the characters. In fact, it went out of its way to include them. You could probably drop kick a couple of them across the room.",0

As a whole though, I didn't enjoy the experience as much as I know I should have. It reminded me of Darth Vader's entrance music in Star Wars : obvious and mildly amusing.",0

The best thing about the movie? Just terrible.,0
"An interesting idea, but thumbs down for CHAIN CAMERA. ... this one just isn't worth the cost of a movie ticket. The results are, to be brutally frank, far more often boring, self - indulgent, overrought and off - puttingly grainy than truly insightful.",0

Barbershop 2 : Back in Business wasn't as good as it's original but was just as funny.,0

This is a tedious movie. < br / > < br / > Grim. No matter that he's meant to be a sympathetic character.,0
"I have to say, I still don't really know what to make of the movie. I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It was a strange mix of light, dark, supernatural. It sadly did not draw me in at all and I rather watched it with a technical eye. Not enough, as it seems, as I had problems getting into the movie. And I really cannot say if some of the laughs the movie got were calculated or not.",0
"Fortunately, this is a fairly short movie, so you won't waste too much of your life on. 2 / 10 Jones was OK in his role, although I thought he was really starting to show his age here. If it was explained, though, I missed it completely.",0
Mickey Rourke? The Rock?,0
About the only good thing about this is the setting. He doesn't vary. Jones just moves at a fast pace through the whole movie. Ned Beatty is wasted.,0
"Needless to say, I greatly anticipated seeing "" In the Electric Mist, "" especially since I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be terrific as Robicheaux. I've also visited New Iberia and much of Acadiana to be able to better visualize the setting in most of these books. Too bad the story's disjointed presentation and Tommy Lee's sub - par performance interfered with the unique mood and spicy zest of region. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell to show up at any time.",0
"Or they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both. I have read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke's Robicheaux mysteries. The scenes at Robicheaux's place were perfect - just as I imagined the bait shop to look like. On the plus side : The soundtrack was wonderful. In a book, that's fine.",0
"Other than slightly detracting from the confusing business at the end with the picture. < br / > < br / > In fact at one point I looked up, sure that the movie had been running for the past 2 hours only to find that I was 51 minutes into it. There is no denying it as much as I'd like to. This is bad movie.",0
- The accents. Tommy Lee Jones has a girl from Guatemala? We didn't understand a thing! No thrills. I actually enjoyed some of his earlier movies. They were horrible. - The plot is beyond comprehension. Blörg!,0

"This can be pretty annoying. With some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made. And Benidorm is a kind of a special place, townscapewise. What's more, the main character has also a knack for karaoke tapes with songs of Julio Iglesias. In this aspect Huevos de oro satisfied me only partially. For the last part a defeated Benito moves to Miami, Florida, presumably in order to start a new life "". < br / > < br / > The movie has three parts. But why all this is mixed together in a rather pretty but also gratuitous way simply eludes me.",0
"I perceived the captain hook / mother reference eons before the movie literalized it for me. The five boys are orphaned ; Barrie is made Hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore, they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics.

Your story would resemble "" Rocky "" because it's the only life - arc Hollywood knows how to produce anymore. I could see the 25 kids twist coming for days.",0
"This play deals with two tradesmen who rent the same room from an unscrupulous landlady, each man believing himself the sole tenant. Because the two men have different work schedules, the ruse is not discovered straight away. Eckbaum and his son are clearly meant to be Jewish. Hoo boy.

But this is not resulting a film well enough either to compare with Italian neo - realists or worth to be Oscar nominee. ), and each of these selling scenes are tried to be interesting to the spectators by skits with comic dialogs. This was the correct story at correct time. Shortly the story is not strong enough and worth to be a movie as by now. Most of the readers will remember the "" Hero grocer against supermarket "" from Ferhan Sensoy in 1980's.",0
"It makes him into something almost cartoon - like. Well, it wasn't a baseball film, which was disappointing. No, it isn't.",0
"Cobb. Boy, what a great movie ( sarcasm intended ). Hopefully someday someone will make a GOOD film about Ty Cobb. It sucked. Who cares?",0
Not for one minute did I forget that it was Tommy Lee Jones on the screen pretending to be Ty Cobb. Robert Wuhl didnt impress either. He just doesn't flesh out Cobb in a way that pulls me into the movie.,0
"His baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure unadulterated violence. Robert Wuhl, portraying the writer Al Stump, is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent. He sucks life out of every scene, trying to make this film his own Nagasaki. It's barely a show ). Ty Cobb is, by far, the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live.",0
Ed Asner was very funny. Too much Eddie. Lets hope there is not a THIRD! The original is a classic. This has got to be the worst piece of crap I have ever seen.,0
"But of course, it never does.",0
It does look good but that'not enough reason to see it. By the way did I mention that it's BORING? It's actually quite tame in that regard.,0
"Not from the gruesome violence but, from the lack of everything else. So, really the film is left with a big hole talking about a guy who dies anyway. Don't spend the big bucks on this film. I definatley didn't. 50 - $ 4. I mean, come on.. who cares? But, this film left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep at times.",0
"The film is absolutely horrible. < br / > < br / > The only way to truly enjoy the film is to set your watch and leave the theatre exactly two hours into the film, because up until that point, it's quite an interesting thriller. < br / > < br / > There's no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, DON't READ ON. I completely understand WHY this movie was made.",0
"I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone. Ridley Scott did some incredibly good movies but with this one he doesn't live up to his name. Either their demands are very low or they haven't read the book or both. Why was Margot Verger, a very important character, totally omitted?",0
"One of the worst theatrical movies of the year, if not all time. Gary Oldman was of course, his brilliant self. Anthony Hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke. but eaten by trained boars???",0

I suppose that this is the'teen'chapter of the Hannibal series ; terrible, stupid, gory for gore's sake and totally embarrassing. < br / > < br / > Hannibal : 1 / 10. * Hannibal SPOILERS * Hannibal Lecter ( Anthony Hopkins ) is back... for a travesty of a movie! And why did the story keep going nowhere?",0

The first Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase was brilliant and hilarious. Why do they bother at all? This is not.,0
"It is amateur hour on every level. Now, I LOVE Italian horror films. Oooh, can you feel the chills?",0
"This movie should only be watched, if people want to learn how not to write good movie. I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema. I wasn't expecting much, when I went in to see the movie. It was pathetic. The movie was filmed with promise, I guess. The storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it. Hannibal was not an exception. And for directing, there was Ridley Scott. There have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better.",0
The predecessor - Silence of the Lambs - is more believable with tension and suspense. Another factor in the disappointment of this film.,0
"A typical old b & w film. I'm here! But once Gatsby moves into his new villa and makes his moves on Betty Field, the film gets overly melodramatic. Run me over and make the ending tragic that way! "" Both Da Silva'acting and his character's behaviour throughout the film Lame.",0
"Leslie Nielson was not funny in it. Do not see "" Mr. Magoo. """,0
"It isn't anywhere near that high grade. Let me correct that, it's just * stupid * - not stupid humour. My laugh never came, so I gave up. < br / > < br / > A very pathetic effort.",0
I don't recall a single funny moment. And I enjoy Leslie Nielson's comic skills. This plot does neither.,0
On a scale of 1 - 10 I give this movie a score of - 100. This movie just does not have what he needs to be funny.,0
"I beg of you, DON'T!",0
I couldn't laugh the entire thing. Their boats crashes. The bathroom goes crazy. It is the horrible script.,0
The blindness of MR MAGOO.,0
"Mr. Magoo - - more like Mr. Ma - who? I left the theater, and I was only 10 years old. The plot was horrid and the acting was worse. That's how bad it sucked. Bottom line - - this flick was fricking bad.",0
"This morning, I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. Mr. Magoo, though, is a complete blank. I even remember the opening animated credits, because I thought that they were pretty amusing.",0
"That's not funny, that'just pitiful.",0
Of course he has no idea what he is doing. You will wish that you were as nearsighted as Magoo. Its a fun movie to watch but its quite a disaster!,0
"So the fact that I'm slamming "" Mr. Magoo "" should show that it's a piece of junk. Leslie Nielsen has also done much better, so there's no reason to waste your time on this.",0
"Lame, ridiculous and absurd.",0
How about telling us that.,0
"Actually, for all intents and purposes, it is not its sequel. Only one character from the original cast returns.",0
Even though i kinda like her southern voice.,0
"It would have saved me from the excruciating misery that was this cr @ pfest. Dear God, is this ever bad. No, I take that back. I love a good novelty song.",0

At least it was a decade ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. My 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle.,0
"The awesome DVD cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box is utter pointless. That's how brilliant this movie is, I guess! You better enjoy gazing at all these perfect female curves, as the rest of "" Golden Temple Amazons "" is a boring and incompetent mess. Wow, I swear this has never happened to me before. The rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the showcasing of ravishing female nudity and gratuitous sleaze.",0
"Again, no complaints. in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting. Our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie. I am surprised no hair pulling is involved. Yeah, it is that kind of movie. < br / > < br / > The witch doctor Kuku was a bloody blast.",0

The music was about as bad as it gets. The dialog was unnatural.,0
I am glad that all of the Native American Code Talkers are getting recognition they deserve.,0
There was nothing funny about it.,0
The Americans double - cross the Mexicans and leave them all for dead. and as such I can't really recommend it to all but the most hardcore Spahetti Western fan.,0

To be honest I'm not surprised. They are really not bad actors but for some reason it doesn't show in this movie. I never understood why, or what the appeal of it is. However the end result is far from comparable. It's probably also due to the poor dialog.

Not just to me, but to everyone else who was forced to sit through this awful film. I'm very sorry. A metal pole could have done a better job. The children were overly whiny. The story is weak, thin, predictable, and completely fake. The film's story is not dismal, but the entire movie itself is exceedingly dismal.",0
In short poor boy needs money for stuff he wants. I wouldn't recommend this movie to families as it encourages a childs rebellion against their parents.

The film culminates in another physical fight between the sisters with a predictable ending. I couldn't state it any better. It is seriously the longest wet T - shirt contest in cinema history. The only thing I would add is that the music in this scene is just plain annoying.

Macy does his best, but as an earlier poster commented, Miller's little parable asks us to suspend disbelief too often. If good intentions were enough to produce a good film, I would have rated the turgid, ponderous, obvious "" Focus "" a bit higher than 4. Sadly, it was an establishment owned by a Jewish family. So, perhaps this film is somewhat valuable in countering the recent wave of sentimental crap about the forties from the likes of Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokow.",0

After that, First, as mentioned, they did it shot for shot. Hitch didn't write the script, you could have rewritten. Why remake such a movie to begin with? I admit I had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason. Where's originality? Viggo Mortensen's accent was annoying and Rita Wilson was far too old to play Caroline. Why not update the dialog?",0
< br / > < br / > Bottom line : Avoid It ` s not because this is a pointless re - film. Didn ` t they go out of fashion in the late 1960s?,0

"Hitch wanted handsome and good actor and it worked just fine. In the opening scene in the original, we can see how tensed and nervous Marion ( Janet ) is when she drives to Phoenix. The best way to describe this movie is by comparing it step by step, acting by acting and process by process to the original. Perkins suited well for Norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger. Again, terrible acting. What should have looked realistic in color did not. Same is with Anne Heche.",0
"The things he did were awful enough, why try to make it worse?",0

"As I said, Vince Vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of Norman Bates.

But there's far more wrong with this movie than just that. < br / > < br / > The first problem is the color. Some of the performances are great. But there is one element to the character that he failed to show : the softness. I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake, ESPECIALLY a shot - by - shot remake.",0
Which is exactly why the casting of him as Norman Bates was a slice of true Hitchcockian genius. As for viewers who can't watch black and white - it's their loss.

Ed Gein : The Butcher of Plainfield is set in the small American town of Plainfield in Wisconsin during 1957 where loner Ed Gein ( Kane Hodder ) lives by himself on a farm after the death if his mother & brother. There's no suspense because we know who the killer is & it's just a tedious wait until he gets caught at the end. There is no real attempt to get into Gein's mind with the makers giving him no more motivation than him occasionally having hallucinations of his domineering mother.,0

Glad I didn't pay to see it. Maybe comedy means something different when applied to a film rather than a series in America. Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters. This film wasn't gross or anything. The characters were very'stagey'and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.,0

"and enough of pointless and slightly boring gun fights, if you're going to do them, do it with some style, not just loads of explosions and inept guards falling down.",0
"Jamie Foxx takes a nosedive as a pilot in the dull Stealth after scooping a gong for Ray. This is the story of her fight for justice, freedom and revenge. Not only is Æon Flux ultimately shallow but for an action flick it's also really very dull. Flux only really succeed in failing.",0

"It may be a disappointing film but it's an average film at best. The acting was alright, nothing special. The costumes are little weird but still look nice and interesting.

So, the movie may be a case of style over substance.",0

"< br / > < br / > Bottom line - Part One is minor genius, Part Two is second tier soap opera perversion. The lead character was suitably naif - like but also intelligent and very very open. What an insult to the hard work of these amazing actors! Why not just make a cheeseball flick to begin with? I almost felt as if he too was growing tired of the endless sex scenes where all he did was lie there pumping his pelvis for yet another breathy naked actress. My biggest pet peeve is when directors let their private fetishes interfere with truth of their movie, and this to me was a supreme example.

"Neither scary nor interesting, The movie's single saving grace is Lewis. So, of course, she has to face the problem - the lunatic living right below her - alone. This type of movie, though, is not worthy of her - which is ironic, given that she's probably only reason anyone would see it.",0
I was disappointed. What!,0
Who cares it sucked anyway.,0
"This movie is NOT worth a "" free "" ticket viewing. < br / > < br / > Stick with the book. < br / > < br / > What a pity. !",0
I know small kids who hated this movie. See GOOD movie! I HATED IT!,0
I couldn't enjoy the film at all.,0
"And another thing, the fish. What is with that stupid fish! Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! Myers proves he can't act in this film. The film sure does look tacky!",0
So I finished it alone. AVOID THIS MOVIE.,0
I've seen some bad things in my time.,0
The plot line dijointed.,0
A far cry from the whimsical world of Dr Seuss. But it turned out to be the the biggest let down. I hope this one does Dr Seuss some justice.,0
"I guess they didn't know either! Holy cow, what a piece of sh * t this movie is.",0
"< br / > < br / > I wanted to claw my eyes out. < br / > < br / > To Mike Myers, I say stick with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World.",0
"It's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. For the MONEY! Was the Cat intended to be a middle aged Jewish woman? F -, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1 - 10. Well I should have went with my instincts. It was a complete piece Hollywood trash.",0
"The Cat came to try to let kids have some fun. Possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist. < br / > < br / > This film, in short is atrocious.",0
"Take Mike Myers, for example. He tries way to hard. His Cat is painfully unfunny.",0
"< br / > < br / > I mean - did Myers even glance at a script? < br / > < br / > Poor Dr Seuss - the man was a genius! < br / > < br / > This film was horrible - the gags were horrible! The plot was messy, messy, messy! Was one written? But unfortunately they cant save this film.",0
A lame plot with dirty jokes. Bad.,0
I think in short this means adult humor. This movie has made me upset! When I think of Cat in the hat.,0
This is his worst film he has ever been in.,0
"What a downer ending! Little Newt is bereft, for another. And what's with the Rangers? The whole episode had terrible pacing, which is what drives a Western. But my biggest complaint, esp. Now I have to go watch Silverado to cleanse my palette.",0
The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces. Whale Rider gets a PG - 13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable.,0
The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor.,0
Essentially what happens here is a total twisting of Dr. Seuss's classic. Take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie. It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money.,0
These guys should stick to making MTV videos. Greed greed and more greed. How on earth this movie got > 400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me.,0
"How could Mike Myers need money? This movie is OVERBLOWN and way, way too long.",0
"Not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now.",0
I saw it for free at college. Go with the Grinch.,0
Thank you.,0
"How wrong I was. Then the cat showed up. Film critics of the world, I apologize. Not that the writers helped him out any. Period.",0
"The Cat in The Hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me. As I began watching I noticed something, this film was terrible. < br / > < br / > Avoid this like a leprous prostitute.",0
"It was a disjointed, rambling, incoherent story. !",0
"Please, please, no sequel. Cat was... well, just awful. So, what was the studio thinking? < br / > < br / > Call the SPCA. Can we talk? Why a New York Accent? < br / > < br / > Why, why, why Mike Myers??",0
What to say about this movie? Nothing unexpected happens. But a good story don't have to be expensive.,0
"Many times, movie seems like it is going to go full - on porn. In the end, I found myself more turned - on by this movie than moved.",0
And that is not all. ah...,0
There´s a buddy - moment which comes out of nowhere at the end. If you want to see Patrick Sway : see Dirty Dancing. < br / > < br / > If you want to see a smart movie : see Memento.,0
It's not recommended.,0
Boring. One of the worst films ever made. The union. The filmmaker forces us to see good from evil. We get to see who the good guys are.,0
"Stacey Keach is too soppy as Lou Ford, and the whole thing has the same production values as that seventies TV spin off, of Planet Of The Apes. Stick to Mike Hammer.",0
All excellent. I had to stop watching.,0
"One of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it. who with his eyes on the prize of Olympic glory, gets up the nose of, in no particular order, his coach, father and team - mates. < br / > < br / > The story is as light as powdered snow with Redford's small - town boy David Chappellet ( what kind of lead name is that? )",0
"I expected much, but sadly this is a boring movie. And a character - driven film without much of a character is never a good bet.",0
Whoever wrote this movie is a sadist.,0
"Instead they get jobs as bartender and a shelf stocker. Julinana Hatfield. There really is no conflict. It is coherent, but lacks all cinematic virtue. But what actually was produced was nearly unwatchable. On paper the movie is below average. Sound exciting? This movie is like a mockery of what is special about movies. The women are capable actresses, but the script was beyond poor. IT wasn't. Like the lion without teeth, this film has no bite. Women living together in a trailer. Bad from start to finish. The women attempt to become hookers, but that never happens. The opening credits for instance are white letters rising mechanically from a red background. Useless.",0
The Moon has great symbolism. The movie drag on in search of a plot. Matthew objects but comes along.,0
Luna would have been great as a quaint little family drama. < br / > < br / > How old was Matthew Barry in this movie? There's a lot of discussion about the mother's love for the son but it's really about Bernardo Bertolucci being pretentious.,0
"In any case there are numerous Peruvian made documentaries, films and books about the subject. To make it even worse, the director chose to not talk about the embarrassing involvement of the CIA with Fujimori's regime. She decides to evade dealing with the only subject for witch her country has much to explain to Peruvians. A friend and I went to see this movie.",0

"33 % of those were caused by SL. There are no journalistic "" cojones "", just soft questions and unchallenged remarks. He is still a menace to Peruvians. This movie should be called "" The return of Fujimori "". Where is Oriana Fallaci when we need her? His regime was very far from being democratic.",0
That is their main justification to give a high rate to the movie. The director herself admitted to this at the first San Francisco film festival showing. She justified it by saying that she couldn't waste the chance of having access to Fujimori.,0
"the photography is good, the costumes are good, but the editing is bad. This slowness continues the entire show. It is very slow - moving. It is a very tedious show to watch.... There is nothing else on, otherwise I'd change the channel ( first night ).",0
"The director shouldn't express her opinion as truth. Most statistics by major poll agencies are much lower. But that is not the case. Not a balanced point of view. Also, the gap between rich an poor continued to increase during Fujimori's regime. It is well documented that the CIA did the planning. < br / > < br / > The movie barely shows one of the massacres that Fujimori is accused of.",0
"I stayed thinking that the film would pick up, however, it never did and I wish I'd left. I am not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie at all - It just wasn't funny.",0
Sadly there's nothing that feels clever or new. Which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas. Rabbit Fever is one of those film oddities.,0
"< br / > < br / > Lines like, "" It's been nearly a week since you used your rabbit - how are you coping? "" The film is based on the idea that the mere mention of the word'rabbit'will get a laugh... and another one, and another one. < br / > < br / > Men, as Germaine Greer rather arrogantly explains, have invented a gadget for women that makes men superfluous in the bedroom. Frantic midnight drives to buy batteries might be amusing in real life, but here they look rather laborious, and the special emergency delivery service outstays its welcome.",0
"Agnes Ayres also appears. Rival Ben Turpin arrives at the same studio, obviously another unemployed comedian! < br / > < br / > There are a lot of jokes involving the buttocks. Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. Chaplin manages to walk in over Turpin, however.",0
Exactly what is never revealed. < br / > < br / > The most interesting aspects of this movie for me was juxtaposing portions with three other flicks or roles I've seen. Definitely not so here.,0
"< br / > < br / > A lot worse. Pressing his face to the door post and his clumsy manner in SPOILER ALERT. He isn't menacing at all. I must admit, Lithgow stole the show. Until this movie. < br / > < br / > To describe it as hammy acting would insult pigs.",0
I saw this on a boring Sunday morning just this morning.,0
Worth watching for a hearty laugh.,0
"But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball. So I caught this one afternoon as "" What Lies Above "" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising. This was the major plot. How do you NOT wrap that up? < br / > < br / > I wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...",0
It wouldn't hold a candle to the other series.,0
"It must have been produced on a budget of pocket change. "".",0
"! This film was a big disappointed and not worth watching, unless there is nothing on the TV toNJOY!",0
"Or rather, it should have been more like a remake of the, instead of what is was. So, how is a monster movie done in the year 2002?",0
Just not for us movie buff's. I'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do. It would also be good movie to take a partner to.,0
My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. 000 times better. I didn't watch the whole movie.,0
Or Steven Seagals. I hope this isn't a portent of things to come. < br / > < br / > What hooked me was the title. Else they might be encouraged to try it on again. I could build me a new house with all the wooden acting.,0
"50 bin. but, i highly doubt it. it had absolutely no redeeming qualities.",0
"It's not so much a script problem. < br / > < br / > The movie tries to be a taut murder - thriller, but sort of just fails at that. The movie was pretty bad. and she has a change of heart and tells Bill and his partner Joe about it and help them with investigation.",0
There are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film. This move meanders like an 85 year old woman driving with wraparound sunglasses and her turn signal on. The Quiroz brothers have no clue.,0
I was very very Disappointed. Agustus and Call really did Nothing? What was the point of this show?,0
< br / > < br / > Then add a cheap camcorder. What a shocker it was.,0
The plot (? ),0
"Seriously. ), attacking model trains and toy cars.",0
"However, by the time horrible flying monster appears, you know you're watching a turkey. In fact, Big Bird from "" Sesame Street "" is even a bit scarier and realistic!!! This is a truly terrible sci - fi / horror film from 1957. < br / > < br / > So far, the film isn't great but it's watchable.",0
Why?,0
It looks like the whole thing was shot right out of somebody'garage. The script is so bad that everything the characters say to one another is ridiculous. That's the second time this blunder has been made. The Flying Saucers'among other sci - fi films from the 50's to beef up the scraggly vulture's attacks.,0
I sat up and took notice at that point. I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. The horror.,0
What is it?,0
It sure made me laugh though... : ) ) This is one awful movie!!,0
That's a bad sign.,0
"I found myself asking who is this? It made me go "" what ""? I don't expect this one to win any awards.",0
Budget be damned. Oh well. Plain and simple. It was simply AWFUL.,0
"Spreading panic from Broadway to Bombay, 1957's The Giant Claw boasts perhaps the ultimate flying monster in movie history. just in time for last - minute clinch with co - star Mara Corday. Luckily for humanity Jeff Morrow, test pilot and "" chief cook and bottle washer in a one - man birdwatching society, "" invents a weapon to disable its impenetrable shield so they can hit it with everything but the kitchen sink but don't worry : Morris Ankrum's general assures him "" We've got kitchen sinks to spare, son. """,0
"This is a movie acting triumph of the first order. What's more, he even sounds as if he believes them. And that sound effect screech makes fingernails across a blackboard sound like Mozart. I barely did. And why The Giant Claw when the goofy critter gobbles its victims with a mechanical jaw. She looks like she just woke up inside a bad dream and maybe if she stands stock - still, no one will notice her.",0
The actors had no idea what it looked like - - it was added after production. Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for this. The acting is good ( for a 1950s monster movie ). Not roaring - - squawking! The problem here is the monster. Dear God - - it's TERRIBLE! Actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre. It looks like a deranged turkey! It has an actually pretty entertaining script - - I was never really bored. But what is it and why is it here?,0
"But I'm a bird lover, what can I say? I love old "" monster movies "" for the pure camp value. It's a bit creepy.",0
< br / > < br / > P. S. The bird needs a haircut. I prefer to think - and hope - it was the former.,0
"I have a degree in Psychology, and this was not accurate. < br / > < br / > Utter garbage.",0
"This movie shows all the situational ethics of bad writing. They deserve each other. I saw it on the CBC's "" Best of Britain "" series. The British Policeman's Union should sue makers of this film for defamation. Is that a more immoral act than his abuse and deviousness. Oh, Yawn.",0
"It's a pity he misused it, though, for the aggrandizement of his wounded ego, feeding on the adulation of unwary sheep who were at his beck and call and in awe of him ) can inspire such extreme adherence and credulity.",0
"This opportunity was missed. Coming from the author of "" The Last Picture Show "", it's a startlingly bad script. Comanche Moon "" is such a mouse. And for a ( net ) four - hour film, it is remarkably episodic and choppy. < br / > < br / > The novel focuses more on the Indians than the Americans.",0
"The title doesn't make much sense to me. She hasn't been there in thirteen years. The woman leaves, and calls a young woman. She looks up in fear. A shadowy figure enters a house. She wants to check her grandmother into a hospital.",0
< br / > < br / > It had potential.,0
Just don't bother with this one. < br / > < br / > The soundtrack is also very mediocre. The acting is very normal. Grosse Pointe Blank was really quite a below average film.,0
"This has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. For me, I prefer more heady stuff like "" I Love Lucy "" or "" Hee - Haw "". It would be pointless as this movie was. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. < br / > < br / > The use of improv is over - rated. I feel that is improv. I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews.",0
"Oh, joy. I wonder if she snuck a look at Keira Knightly ( if extras and stars are allowed to mix ) and wondered : where did it all go wrong?! Unless you're Sylvester Stallone. Her latest ( and only other credited role ) is as Probationary Nurse # 5 in Atonement. The new teacher must save the day ( Even though he is really... Oh, who cares? )",0
This was a pathetic movie. There is nothing this movie has to offer except a headache. No one developed any concern for the main character. !,0
The lighting is awful. This isn't. The film looks cheap and bland. The script is a big flawed mess.,0
Have it scripted by a 10 year old. Add more plot holes than plot. Result : duff film.,0
"Which I've already seen. < br / > < br / > A meteorite crashes on the lawn next to a private girls'college. My appreciation of "" Deadly Instincts "" grew following that discovery. It's strange what fate does to some people.",0

Good fun stuff! It has the same type of feel to it as Nowhere to Run.,0
You get the idea.,0
"Why not put your money into making a spectacular 3D remake of "" It Came from Outer Space "" instead? ending ensues.",0
"This is one seriously cheesy movie, and the whole thing was obviously done on a shoestring budget, although the alien isn't too bad ( I've seen far less convincing men - in - rubber - suits at any rate ). None of the acting is Oscar material and the Isle Of Man doesn't really double for Boston Massachussetts very convincingly.",0
"< br / > < br / > What is wrong? Another T & A shot! "".",0
Anyone looking for tense action is likely to be disappointed.,0
The biggest one is the lack of depth. I'm not even sure if I can rate 0 / 10? The flaws in this movie is beyond explanation. ?,0
And a thoughtless storyline is covered up by confusing the viewer with convolution. It is one of the worst Chinese movies I have ever seen. You now have an action sequence for Ashes of Time. Bravissimo!,0
"In particular, what was it about the film which dragged it down, and made it the director's worst film of his career? Bold, audacious and innovative, but a failure nonetheless. So what went wrong?",0
"Dialogs are minimalists and not original at all. Ashes of Time "" was an audacious project but ended up being a pretentious movie. This film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex manner. By forgetting that he delivers an awkward movie that doesn't even fulfill its artistic objective. The narrative part is seen through Ou - yang Feng's eyes ( Leslie Cheung ).",0
He seems more like the serious guy trying too hard to be funny. Ha ha!,0
"The result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie. < br / > < br / > Thanks to these brutal but very few fights, the movie is put into the action genre. A comprehensible story. < br / > < br / > The editing and timeline of story is also mishandled. Much is left out in the scenes, the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way.",0
It's not sick.,0
"This is scriptwriting folks. I also dare you to try to make out what Banjo is saying. "" !",0
"I am still trying to figure out if I misheard it when they said the hero of the piece was a stunt car driver. I am not sure why the female biker did what she did at the end, but hey it is a bad movie, you always get scenes that make little sense.",0
She then takes it from the shopkeeper and shoots him.,0
"That was cheesy. A COLD ONE "".",0
"Probably the biggest thing about Wild Rebels that hurts it the most is the hero. He's got LOSER written all over him, but that doesn't stop him from "" getting the girl. """,0
"Taken on that level, it's a good example of the biker flick genre. The soundtrack is quite well done, featuring a nice'Ventures'style bass / drum riff that keeps things moving and saxophones and brass charts that pep things up quite a bit. < br / > < br / > There are a whole bunch of goofy story elements : Linda ( the girl gang member ) disables a bank guard with a drug - filled syringe, the final shootout takes place inside a lighthouse (! And although the script is pretty shallow, all the actors inhabit their cardboard characters convincingly and with a fair amount of energy.",0
"If you decide to watch Wild Rebels, don't expect anything deep and meaningful. Apparently, these three Einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires, not four. I could go on forever, but you get the idea.",0
"Steve Alaimo, Bobbie Byers and Willie Pastrano are quite a comedown!",0
There are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre ones. < br / > < br / > It has its moments.,0
"OK, so just slangs and crashes.",0
So it'not completely un - worthy then of its Mystery Science Theater 3000 status as of late.,0

"My Lord, but he's just one of a whole slew of awful, awful actors that appear in this turkey. Once, this may have been considered good. I kid you not. How innocent we were in those days. < br / > < br / > As I said. But otherwise its just the worst kind of rubbish. Scary stuff. No wonder MST3K picked it. Oh dear! Avoid it except for a good laugh. The hero is so wet you can hear his squishy damp footsteps in every scene. < br / > < br / > To put it bluntly, this film is crap.",0
"You frankly don't care about anyone in it, so there's no jeopardy or suspense.",0
"Loch Ness Horror "" is an overall boring flick with only a couple of noteworthy elements. We open traditionally, with bag pipes music during the opening credits. And, eureka, this is a prototypic bad movie!",0
And the sound they used for the roaring is the best part. What can I say about a movie as bad as this?,0
"Turns out it came out just a few years before I saw it. I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment. It still seems to be very hard to find on video. This movie was like the last gasp of the drive - in era and I caught a whiff of it just in time. Actually when we were watching it, we couldn't figure out if it was made in the 50s or the 70s. So I've never actually seen the beginning of the movie, but I saw most of it.",0
"Yes, it is that bad too. That guy did not learn to stop, did he? OMG, another bad film by Larry Buchanan. < br / > < br / > I am surprised that the crew of MST3K never heard this movie.",0
"No. The water is crystal clear, nor cold.",0

Wassup Rockers was just plain bad. I have no clue. I got it way back in the beginning. Who is the main character? Is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted?,0
but it doesn't. I loved the movie Kids.,0
"However, unlike Kids, none of them have any semblance of talent. < br / > < br / > It has no substance. That's it. Ken Park dealt somewhat ham - handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui. Bully touched upon similar issues. The story itself is ludicrous. There is better acting in porn. Irrefutably, all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth.",0
"Not every punk song incorporates "" Oi! "" into its choruses, as they do in this particular film.",0
the acting was crap.,0

What in the world! The cinematography was useless.,0
"I wanted to laugh out loud at the voice - overs - so silly!! This movie is worth viewing only to see him.... and he seems like he wandered into a bad dime romance novel, poor fellow. Poor Sela Ward, so lovely, but so wooden.... surely she'been better in other movies.",0

I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. I just didn't care. The story seemed recycled, nearly to the point of plagiarism.",0
"The result - a film, sadly, so bad that it's just very, very bad. As a rule, I try to find as much in films as I possibly can to enjoy them. Really, I wonder why Christina Wayne bothered. But no effort, no matter how great, could possibly redeem this pitiful excuse for a movie. Firstly, the cinematography was directionless and ineffective. Alas, such was not the case.",0
"Sadly, she can't pull that off either. The plot has nothing to do with a plot. The lead is a girl who tries to be Claire Daines.",0
This was that movie.,0

Utopias are notoriously dull and this one turns out to be no exception. But apart from that, it's just not very interesting. It has none of the depth of, say, Aldomovar's Talk to Her, which I loved.",0

There's also a silly psychological sub plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him.

"Certainly the German Armed Forces of World War II included men who were able to maintain some decency throughout the war, and others who did very bad things, but the attempts in the movie to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish. While there are a few good elements of this movie, overall it is a failure. To me the worst aspect is that it includes substantial anachronisms, and also some very contrived and clichéd elements, most glaringly in some encounters between a German officer and a Soviet woman. I don't think that any movie can really succeed in depicting the titanic struggle and suffering that actually occurred, but I still wanted to see what a relatively recent German movie production would be like. With all of its technical flash, the 1993 "" Stalingrad "" movie is very disappointing. Stalingrad "" and "" S. P.

"Instead, because of English's thematic overreach, the production comes across as an extended therapy session with a paucity of wit. To add insult to injury, the recent big screen adaptation of HBO's "" Sex and the City "" did this sort of sorority - style dishing much better and with far sharper fangs.

The whole movie just seemed to take itself too seriously. by the size of a guy'nose ring.,0

"Not me. Great cast, fair acting, interesting plot.",0
The whole movie was negative. There are just too many starving actors in Hollywood. What am I saying?,0
"Since then I've seen it a number of times. When he makes his first full appearance in the film, it is a truly terrifying sight. They fail and Hendricks reverts back to his old self. The direction is okay, too. Someone who has tattooed and pierced their body to the very extreme. With the exception of Snider, the acting isn't too good, but it's serviceable. As it stands, the running time is only an hour and a half. They believe they're going to a party. I first rented this movie on the infamous day of September 11, 2001.",0
"It seems that Dee Snyder ran out of ideas halfway through the script. These are just some of the questions I had watching this film. What's with the one - time personality detour to bible - thumper? Cop rescues her, psychopath is put in therapy / jail. I guess they couldn't afford two boom mikes? The cop is pretty one note, and his detached quality is not quite believable. If that is so, he failed. And the audio in the final showdown scene is really poor.",0
The Power started off looking promising but soon became boring and tedious to watch. The plot is about an ancient Aztec doll that takes possession of those who own it.,0
"They offer to explain the situation to a news reporter who doesn't buy into the spiritual bologna. Although three teens are somewhat critical plot, it is by no means a teen horror film. It might be worth checking out, even if just for laughs. And, though not terribly gory, the special effects were done nicely.",0

"The madcap antics of the film, typical of the period, are great. A maddeningly mediocre talent.",0
"Maybe this movie was funny in 1988, I don't know. I wish I'd waited longer.",0
It's pretty much laugh free. It's over before it even gets going.,0

They are the reality version of Jay and Silent Bob. I wasn't fooled so it was actually a tad boring.,0
"The concept of this movie is unique, however its execution is less than special.",0

Disco died and it is gone forever. Cant go wrong. Wanna see good documentaries?,0
"On the negative side, many of the battles did have a somewhat "" staged "" look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. However, I must say now that I was somewhat disappointed.",0
"even its fake or not its very very death disturbing, nauseating indeed. it was a relief to know it was not real after reading the comments. the people behind this should be bought to justice asap.",0
"< br / > < br / > The acting overall was very poor, even for a Nicolas Cage movie. I managed to watch the whole thing but I won't likely ever see this film again.",0
Don't waste your time with it. Nice eye candy though.,0
"Give me a little more credit than that. We had to look it up on Wikipedia. It's like they were trying to brainwash us into just accepting "" superstrings are the best thing since sliced bread.

"There is also some decent go on display including a splendidly bloody beheading. The presence of charismatic Paul Naschy almost saves this clichéd slasher flick.

My rating : 2 out of 10.,0

I love low budget movies. First she's outside the window with a body and 15 seconds later she's in the living room knitting. 56 min waste of time.",0
An object lesson in how to make a bad movie which masquerades as Horror. Giving this rubbish 1 is because it can't get any less. The director of this garbage probably had more money than sense.,0
"OK end of the story is - all the kills were a joke on the main character and no one is actually dead. < br / > < br / > Avoid the movie if it means buying it to see, if a friend has it, it might be funny movie to borrow.

"At least Gosling and Pitt, as the conniving sneering suspects, acquit themselves adequately. As Cassie probably says on her next case, there's nothing to see here people. Murder By Numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made - for - TV but isn't. ).",0
and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes. pretty much none of the characters were likable. the ending was not worth watching at all.,0
But it didn't. The characters'identities changed for the worse within the movie.,0

"Marty of course is too nasty and smug to give Jason's father Harry ( Michael Bryan French ) a phone call, and he evens burns the "" Big Fat Liar "" paper. So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as hellish as possible, until he agrees to call Jason'Dad.",0
"Adequate! Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R. D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D. A. Al Swanson.

I also remember it being the worst film I had ever seen up to that point and I promptly threw it in the garbage. IT WAS! And a full other 5 people have seen it.... Amazing.,0
Not much less can be said about them besides what everyone else has said. For a while it seemed like this show was on 24 / 7.,0

Unless they had ulterior motives. It totally sucked! I'd rather a sharp stick in the eye than watch this offensive movie again. I'm running out of good reasons NOT TO rent this film. YECK! A colossal waste of time and money. Maybe s / he was the director or the producer.,0

Zarkor is one bad movie. So obviously fake that they scream out at the viewer. It's just bad. The only good thing about the movie is the monster suit. And maybe a decent script would have helped too.,0

George and Mildred is a truly unfunny film.,0
George's sputtering incredulity also gets lost in the more expansive sets. This is not to say that they were much to shout about. Mildred lacks the sharpness of her TV incarnation ; cutting asides and withering looks largely directed at Georges lack of libido.,0
"He learns voodoo magic from the female slave Mambo Azaleigh. He saves her son Ariel, who thus accompanies him into his exile. Prospero does not care about the war.

"It was rather bland and drudging to say the least. A book like this I feel might be to heavy for a lot of people. The basis of the story is Conrad writing lavishly of the surroundings, he sets the scene wonderfully, but possibly a bit to extensively.",0
"At the onset, I expected that the movie would help put together the jigsaw puzzle of a book.",0
"The movie on the other hand I found tiresome and boring. If you are looking for a great book to read over the weekend this is not the book for you. The movie, "" Heart of Darkness "" comes no where near giving the book justice.",0
It just comes across as indifferent in a way. The story just never manages to grasp the viewer.,0
Finally I feel that the movie was too cut and dry. Not enough though was put in to the original text and how that made the story what it is today.,0
"This is not insightful journalism. It is just that bad. Hmmmm. Okay, that is a good start. Did Beavis and Butthead make this movie? So, how do these wines compare?",0
"Might end up being the biggest disappointment that I will see in 2009. Sadly, Park's take was a tired one.",0
"It shows a lot of non - important and annoying flashes. He fit the character in "" Of Mice and Men. "" I would have to say reading the novel is way better than the movie. < br / > < br / > The movie is poorly edited. This was a big source of futility in the novel.",0
"After I finished reading Heat of Darkness, I watched the movie, which was a mistake. In the movie that part was just left out. This was a big source of futility.",0
The movie left me feeling rather bored and was a complete waste of my time.,0
"Over all, I would rate the movie at 3 out of 10 stars. He practically whispers all of his lines which, in a more capable actor's hands, could have been very thought provoking. A couple hours pass and he wakes up : total waste of time. One other flaw is Kurtz's character. John Malkovich is a terrible choice to play the man who is described as tall and inspirational : a man with a commanding presence.",0
"The book wasn't what I expected to it to be, and the movie disappointed me even further.",0
"I would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book. The fiancé's reaction to Marlow's interpretation of Kurtz'last words also differed. This movie ; and many others, did not fulfill this book.",0
I couldn't really understand the plot as well while watching the movie.,0
"Their acting wasn't very exciting or memorable at all. < br / > < br / > It is hard enough to make any book into a movie. So why the novel, The Heart of Darkness, is made into a movie, I am clueless. There is so much description and hidden meaning throughout the entire book.",0
"I loved the book, so you should definitely read it and enjoy it. After reading the book, Heart of Darkness, the movie did not do it justice. That way, you can see what the differences are in the movie and book and contemplate them. < br / > < br / > Of course any book is better than the movie but these weren't even comparable. The movie doesn't even start to show any of this. His character was depicted the best. If you have not read the book, I don't recommend the movie because it is a boring, lifeless mess.",0
"Also, at the end of the book Kurtz dies on the boat, not at the inner station. For instance, he acquired Tim Roth and John Malkovich, both of whom would later go on to have successful careers. The movie made it even worse. Also, though I am ripping his book to shreds, I do have some respect for him, because Not exactly anyone's cup of tea. I am not a fan of that. I was highly disappointed about almost everything in the movie. Hurry up.",0
"Plus, the topic is so relevant and timely. So I definitely was ready and willing to listen to these film makers. This film appears to be an exposé of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry.",0
It totally missed the biggest issue of light versus dark. The book that this movie is based off of has little action to begin with. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. It is utterly a chore to watch. I feel like it's impossible to accurately show thoughts.,0
"All of the actors were dull and uninteresting. A great novella, but a very poor film. It does not come close to doing justice for Joseph Conrad's novella. Marlow's journey to find Kurtz was supposed to venturesome, but I didn't experience that in the movie. The movie completely shames the book to the highest level possible.",0
"On the other hand, the book was definitely extraordinary. In summary, the movie seemed to be a bad interpretation of the book. It was dreadful, and in complete disarray. To be quite honest the movie made me want to fall asleep.",0
"And the director's to blame. "". So i was convinced the director was a beginner. The movie tells the story.",0
"< br / > < br / > Finally, Kurtz also seemed to be interpreted incorrectly. There is an immeasurable difference between the two. You, as the reader are required to be capable of inferring and connecting Joseph Conrad's ideas. Overall, the movie "" Heart of Darkness "" was pitiful compared to the book. However, connections were weak. Marlow was much more of a stranger. I began to think that the director was trying to utilize the same "" read between the lines "" method as Conrad did. The speed of the movie kept the viewer from getting to know the characters. I didn ' It seems to me that the director was walking into a losing battle. The immense detail and magic of the story would be impossible to justly interpret. The additional half is a series of connections made by the reader. The colossal fine points created by Joseph Conrad cannot be rightfully recreated through film. His role was short and the details weren't all included.",0
"The book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely disregarded in the movie. After seeing the film version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel as if I wasted 100 minutes of my life. The differences completely changed the story for me. It sincerely feels as if Roeg was filming another story with references from Heart Of Darkness embedded in it. Though I thought the camera work was poor and the cast unfitting, it is a captivating story all same.",0
"Presumably, the coincidence of the two "" Marlow ( e ) "" characters is just that. There are rumors that he has "" gone native. "" The film was never made.",0
I always hated Stephen Williams's directing. I honestly don't think it has to do anything with the writing. IT was so BORING! Bad perspective of camera work too!,0
"< br / > < br / > Will, I keep watching it? ye!",0
"It is at best confusing and absurd. When the twists and turns finally revealed themselves, rather than saying "" Ahh, I get it! "" < br / > < br / > My recommendation : don't bother! I muttered something along the lines of "" Okay... whatever. "" < br / > < br / > The characters were stereotypical, unsympathetic, and wholly ridiculous.",0
< br / > < br / > I can't understand how the talented Mr. Rickman gets into these mediocre films? )? There were times when I honestly couldn't tell if the director meant Judas Kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof. Why did he mistrust the detective he replaced?,0
It's worth seeing for their scenes - and Rickman's scene with Hal Holbrook.,0
It has no saving grace whatsoever. It must have haunted him the rest of his days. It is wooden and pedantic.,0
Is that Lana Turner really singing with Pinza? Pinza is no leading man either. Not bad if it is her.,0
"The two fall in love, while enjoying the pretty Italian countryside. The cast album, and Pinza's golden "" Some Enchanted Evening "" single, sold millions. Unhappily, Mr. Pinza is called away to his Kingly father's death bed, leaving Lana in the lurch.",0
"That's not exactly something feminists would like. < br / > < br / > Pretty stupid really. It brought nothing new to the genre at all. It looks ridiculous, she basically brushes it against him and it falls apart. I watched this basically for the sole reason that it was supposed to have Third Reich references in it.",0
Seems unrealistic to me.,0
"Skip this movie unless "" Ernest goes to Camp "" is the only rental left. This is a pretty lousy picture. It offers nothing unique or original or even interesting.",0
It was also overlong and boring.,0
It's not even scary.,0

"It has no credibility, instead lots of predictability. Finally got to see this movie last weekend. Save yourself the money and the.",0
"Amusing sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear. It reminds me of its American cousins, horror slashers. Why do they need to have it all in just one movie?",0
"This story is based in Germany, which is also where the movie is made.",0
"And to think this could have been great. There's sex in the most unappealing and unerotic way. The soundtrack is one of the reasons. The controversial subject matter was a good concept. < br / > < br / > 3 / 10 Let's see. This movie seems to run in 3 modes : Happy, Sex and Dark.",0
"There is an endless supply of trashy horror movies. I'd rather watch the paint dry. Alas, very seldom these attempts succeed.",0
"In essence, she is saying, "" I found you out. < br / > < br / > 3 ) Her roommate gets killed. She was, of course, wrong. < br / > < br / > But it contained so many dumb clichés from the worst of the old American slasher / horror movies.",0
But it has a one poor part. It's a good mystery and horror movie.,0
"Firstly, this movie works in the fact that it is disturbing. It is somewhat... distastefull to me personally. And the cops? I was looking at the clock a bit on this movie.",0
"It keeps that way right into the end. < br / > < br / > I was looking forward to this movie as everyone was talking about it as being a good horror movie, and finally an European one. So, maybe my expectations were to high.",0
"< br / > < br / > The arty title sequence did not fool jaded punter. What it's establishing is the lead character's perverted proclivities, of course (! )",0
"< br / > < br / > And people consumed it. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you. Blood? Within year MCOCA was passed. This movie is made for such psychopaths. You can ignore. With it's "" you have to be a monster to save your nation "" approach.",0
"But compared to Child's Play, this film is more superb. The killing dolls will remember you a cute version of "" Chucky "".",0
It turns out that everyone is there for a reason and that as much as i could grasp. The worst ever Korean movie!,0

I think this movie can be called the movie of misdirected rage. Peter Boyle was capable of better stuff.,0
"Martin Scorcese of all people even got involved, though probably only to give a nod to the dank, lavatorial hues of the grim urban cinematography, which almost certainly influenced Taxi Driver four years later.

Bava's creature is a humongous sea - devil and it's more than just a shark! You know how it goes in these cheap European imitations, right?",0
"It's pretty much the same kind of film that almost every italian hack of a director cranked out. < br / > < br / > The movie is a prime example of really bad movies coming out of Europe during the eighties. Yikes. < br / > < br / > So, try and get the MST3k version. It's a pretty fun episode with Mike and gang in quite good form.",0
"The cast of virtual nobody's don't help make this any easier to sit through. Peter, Stella, Hogan and Sandra all set out to sea.

"Well that's hard to explain. Devil Fish is just plain old bad. It's not the only Italian film to suffer this fate. I think, however, that the film's biggest sin is its lack of a budget.

"< br / > < br / > From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort Europe to take up arms and defy Hitler and Mussolini. Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does catering. Sound like anyone you know? A comedian and a sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel silly and hapless. In fact, Hynkel's regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery. He creates an aggressive, antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache. All this does is to humanise him.",0
"This happened during the time this film was made and the investigations of Hollywood by the Federal government. A classic piece of art must stand the test of time. WWII started in an attempt to save Poland. But those that address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from me. In my opinion, Chaplin's voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous. His career never recovered when sound came to film. If Chaplin found the US so offensive, why didn't he return to his native land. < br / > < br / > Chaplin's apologists have excused his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous.",0

But Dr. Tom's weakness seems to stem from stupidity more than circumstances. You're left wondering if he attended the same Walk away "", but Tom does it anyway. I'm not sure that's a good move for a guy fresh out of pen, but this script ( co - written by Diane Fine ) has very little to do with logic.

The movie was just bland.,0
and I think this detracts from film.,0

There's a lot of violence in this movie. The second half was pretty bad. It suffered the same problems. It was interesting and suspenseful. The characters were almost interchangeable. There were never any over - the - top sound effect. It was a crime movie which played it straight. We're somehow supposed to be amused by this.,0

Does anyone think they didn't want to see it work? There are lots of other comments here about how poor this film is.,0
You might enjoy it if you're fan of bad movies. And I did. - - was ill - advised at best.,0
"Instead, we see a shallow, two dimensional figure from a soap opera. < br / > < br / > Dwight Schultz is miscast as Oppenheimer.",0
"Bad science. Most people know what it was, but few people understand the depth and breadth of the project. That's Hollywood, I guess. I've read just about every major book about the Manhattan Project. Horrible casting.",0
"The keystone of this conflict is the continued disagreements between General Groves and Dr. Oppenheimer. This massive display of force, they felt, would be enough to win the war - no killing would be needed. The United States built the atomic bomb in order to show their superior military power and to end the Second World War.",0
This is a critical point. Michael Merriman did not really exist.,0
"The film clocks in at just ten minutes short of the two hour mark, and that is far too long for a film like this. I'm not even going to bother mentioning the acting, atmosphere etc, there's no point. is made up of talking, and you can imagine how much fun that is to sit through! Naturally, it's not long before a group of people - made up of a few men and some scientists, who all happen to be sexy women, land on the island.",0
"< br / > < br / > This is a pity, because the film sets up a promising idea. A group of scientists are taken to the Atoll by a naval officer in a small vessel. The sight of the monster forcing a gorgeous young woman to suck his over - sized member certainly throws the target audience's ugly fantasies in their face.",0
"Still, the movie is FUN. etc. Sure it depends on one's sense of humor, however I'm pretty sure La Momia should teach any newcomers to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it. < br / > < br / > La Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano, however, was not that bad.",0
"Bloody Birthday'is an odd and, at times, humorous low - budget horror flick along the lines of'Mikey'or a less intelligent version of'The Good Son '. One to watch if there's nothing else on. Instead, it's amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten - year - olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns, knives and crossbows. There is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time aren't equally as twisted but there you go! Only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them.",0

so if you have any decency left in you. this film is so unbelievably awful! everything about it was rubbish.,0

The comments are even funnier. You should watch this movie through MST : 3000. ).,0
The bad acting isn't enough...,0
And the special effects? !,0
This is a pretty pointless remake. Loads of things are left unexplained at the end - why do the aliens need all the heat and water for example? Kerwin's character gets in and out of his car more often than is humanly possible in one movie. It just runs through its minimal hoops and then just ends.,0
"That clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing ( a contrast at first sight ). His movies are not discussed well. For instance, his father'splendid villa at Grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that. Why?",0

"Where are the MST3k guys? I thought, in a world where there can be a killer'Lift'and a'Blood Beach,'this'Deathbed'might be amusing to watch. Hilariously, at one point it downs Pepto - Bismol.

( Now, that's getting back at its human companions! )",0
The movie wasn't great but it was okay until the hand scene. It had something to do with foam or something.,0
"Trust me... you'll know when you get to that point. DB : TBTE has got to be, hands - down, the best movie to watch when stoned. Plus, everything in the film is pretty organic... from old - fashioned natural breasts to the bucket of fried chicken. When I move my hand, it leaves trails!! """,0

Even the sparkling Ziyi Zhang looks like she's just waiting for her next movement or line. Read that again as 2 weeks and things begin to make sense. Weird with unnecessary singing and backdrops. The acting is flat.,0
"I didn't get a sense of whimsy and I didn't get sucked into this universe. Without the compelling love story at the center of the film though, it's hard to care what happens. There were also scenes where it was hard to tell what the action occurring was because it was so stylized. Odagiri was OK but doesn't make much of an impression. The language barrier in this film seems to have only exacerbate matters. < br / > < br / > I didn't even care for the characters separately. There really is a sore lack of characterization. Although, I loved looking at it, except for a few brief musical scenes, I can't say I enjoyed it. She's a capable actress but she has her limitations. The only reason to care about them seems to be that they're good - looking royalty.",0
"Unless you really like watching other peoples'amateur video, this ain't good.

I'd like to test this on real children ; I think they'd drop it for Uproar in Heaven after about 20 minutes.",0
"The dialogue isn't great, Professor Moriarty feels almost like an afterthought as if they couldn't come up with a villain for it & as a whole it's far less engaging than other's in the series. But is London as safe as Holmes thinks? The script by Edward T. Lowe Jr., Scott Darling & Edmund L. Hartmann is based on short'The Dancing Men'by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle & isn't the tradition Holmes murder mystery as it's more of a wartime adventure story. It has no real style or imagination & lacks both atmosphere & intrigue as well.",0
2 / 10 Movie also holds record for most cars driven through walls. Random highlight : some crazy dude eating live lizards. Powerful.,0
"If you can, it's awesome. The main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible, but not here. Why would they need it? Best scene? If you can't appreciate trash, don't watch it.",0
The ending is just as ridiculous mindless as the rest.,0
A company even takes credit for making this tin can! Obviously they gave each other the business and were put to death for it. ( Now that is severe! The first viewing left me half crazed and babbling. Guess it's better than the Laughing Fat Man. I only screamed in agony once. ).,0

"Due to rather dubious plate tectonics, Japan starts to slip under the sea. < br / > < br / > But, it does have nice special effects, and Kou Shibasaki is still pretty hot, so I magnanimously give it... 3 / 10. It is at least as nationalistic, humourless and lacking in self - awareness as that Hollywood film would be though, and probably has even worse acting.",0
"This disaster movie IS a disaster, and a massive one at that. Morbid as it might sound, show us the victims! It's akin to Godzilla knocking over buildings, and it'as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act. < br / > < br / > The special effects are gorgeous to look at. There are no details, and everything is seen from afar, in a God - like mode.",0
"Gimme break. The incongruities in the pacing are bizarre. This time around, it is mad ( - or - is - he? ) scientist Toyokawa who gets to be the poster boy for Japan Tobacco. < br / > < br / > The Japaneseness of the film is both touching and repugnant.",0
What a terrible movie!,0
I rented The Matrix Revisited with a friend of mine. We both loved The Matrix and we both love filmmaking so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of The Matrix.,0
"Local Mexican legends speak of the Chupacabra, an evil creature from myth & legend. To be honest apart from the title there's nothing here to indicate a Werewolf film at all & even then title is just a rip - off of the highly popular An American Werewolf in London ( 1981 ).",0
"If you're into that sort of thing, go for it. This film fits this model perfectly. Most of them are heroes - sort of - but one is ( of course ) mad, and quite perverse. < br / > < br / > The plot is ridiculous, but deliciously convoluted.",0
"< br / > < br / > Anyways, horrible movie. I mean my god, she was indescribably bad. Awful. First off, Mexican Werewolf in Texas'title is misleading as many others have pointed out.",0
"My vote is one ( awful ). In the dusty little town of Furlough in Texas, an animal is slaughtering the cattle and the locals. The "" special effects "" are gruesome and extremely poor and the "" werewolf "" is the cheapest I have ever seen. Ed Wood movies are cult, but this "" Mexican Werewolf in Texas "" is pure garbage. But I believe correct quote should be "" no man ( or woman ) can resist to watch this movie to the end "".",0
"Anyway the movie isn't any good. This title is bullcrap. But I must warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad. It's so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody. It's a low budget horror movie with a Chupacabra monster. The actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous. I hate her. Actually it's bloody awful. They almost never say a line in a normal way.",0
Was this actually filmed in Ireland? I wanted her to shut up. Most everything was still harvested.,0
However there was more than one topic of conversation. Remembrances are carried out for those who died in the Civil War. And it doesn't get much better. It is striking how few Irish films have dealt with the Irish civil war and its legacies. Schoolchildren go to school to learn about the Civil War. Sometimes one wonders how a film of such awe - inspiring awfulness comes into existence.,0
Risible. Clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director. He is also barking mad.,0
This movie was a rather odd viewing experience. The movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer. < br / > < br / > Really not worth your time. The movie is way too'stagey'and they didn't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie. The movie is obviously based on a play.,0
"Contains spoilers. We learn that during his career as an Army officer, Charles was regarded as having'low moral fibre '. The film ends with his committal to an upper - class lunatic asylum. < br / > < br / > The British director J.

"This doesn't make a story, not even close.",0
"When Above the Law came out, it was a great action film. Wahoo. He needs change.",0
It´s no doubt a cable - movie and not one for the theatre. You can really feel the American air but that´s all.,0
")ebriated. It will make you feel better. "" ROTFL.",0
"It's not half as good any of those films. On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood, he got his first leading man role in this B picture Love Affair. She considers a show business career as a way for an income. The part doesn't wear well on him.",0
"Steven Seagal plays a doctor!!!!!!???! The Patriot is an extremely boring film, because nothing happens.",0
My personal favorite in this movie is Whitney Yellow Robe.,0
"Very long, drawn out, and boring. Cure for insomnia. This movie simply had no substance.",0
Serve immediately. : The Patriot.,0
"One weak fight scene. So she gets hunted thinking the cure is in her blood. And to shorten moment, neither Ann or Wesley are infected by the virus... hmm. Story : Okay so Wesley lives in another darn outback with his sweet daughter Holly.",0
and that Grandpa's family seem to be about the only people who know anything about this?,0
"However, what follows is one of the dumbest scenes I have watched in a very long time! This is so utterly silly and ridiculous, I found myself laughing out loud. However, when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way, his dreams all seem to go on hold. < br / > < br / > Bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. By now, the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with Bogey's sister ( whew! ) All this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable. < br / > < br / > The bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film.",0
"But it doesn't make for good action. As an action film it fails, as a drama it stinks, as an environmental message it's obvious. Which is fine. of this film finally kicked in I saw the twist (? ) Avoid like Ebola crossed with plague. < br / > < br / > When the plot (? ) Seagal's anti - warfare, care - for - mother - nature stance is not very subtle.",0
"This is not art, this is boredom. None. I see the director is my age ( b. Maybe that's the point of all this? < br / > < br / > Plot? stand around. Film Festival in Sept. 2005. Surely they had color in 1968! It adds nothing to the movie.",0

That is love? NOTHING.,0

"Jane Seymour's psychotic monologues were laughable. It's almost a satire of its genre, like a Kenny G meltdown.",0
I just had to watch it entirely to see how it ended.,0
This is so embarrassing.,0
"And oh, yeah, they had Barry Bostwick playing male lead. 'Nuff said. I taped it just because I liked Jane Seymour.",0

I'm surprised they actually have writers. And people think this is'edgy '??,0

Insulting crap. It relies on 3 things : 1.,0
"Family Guy started out as something fresh, funny and more original. Ya know what? The random humor USED to be funny.",0
"Everything about this show is terrible. But no, it's not funny at all.",0
"let it die. I was sorta excited about the return of family guy until I saw the "" new "" crap they were putting out. No surprise, it was exactly like the old crap. if you actually do find family guy funny than you must be retarded or borderline retarded. its no longer funny, its just annoying.",0
If I am not mistaken Kathy Griffin did a voice - over for this show and it looked too odd to be funny. This could have been great. Lois should have been named Lois Lame because is sort of one - dimensional. The same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size. The Simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into.,0
"Are references inherently funny? He's just a loud, obnoxious pig. Family Guy is superficially like The Simpsons and South Park. However, what it has in loquacity it lacks in true wit. Many are references to bad TV sitcoms or commercials.",0
Just flat disgusting. A guy drinking horse semen? Wow.,0
"It had its moments, but overall when I watched this cartoon as a child I was bored out of my mind. The gadgets in the cars were cool though and provided some entertainment for me back then.",0
"? As a kid, I never understood WHY anyone would watch this very crappy show. For example, one episode might be made up of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! But who can tell considering all we have to watch is this Americanized mess!",0
"It should't be seen by people so I'm warning you not to see it. The puppets didn't even do anything nor did they kill people. Nobody even got kill but one or two, very pointless. To some it was great but, to others it was a ticket tonores - ville and boy are they right.",0
He used this power to bring normal puppet to life. If there was one franchise that needed to be cut off it would be this one.,0

BORING! !,0
Oh!,0
"Very evident that the budget was extremely low. In turn, turning us away from the series. To sell Puppet Master Toys! < br / > < br / > Yuck!",0
"Retro Puppet Master is complete and utter CRAP. 2 out of 10. The movie contains no horror, or suspense.",0
PLEASE.,0
"Salman Khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles. The music is not too bad. Avoid this at all cost! He shrieks and whines too much. It's probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible film! It's a remake of "" The Wedding Singer "". One guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back! He doesn't have Sandler's sense of comic timing. "". To be sure, I went to watch the film and what do you know?",0
Now this is a movie I really dislike.,0
Basically every episode has scenes similar to that. They don't even try to make it look realistic. Give me a break!,0
Story line was rather empty. William Hurt was the worst.,0
Lazy movie made by a lazy director. The characters are grotesque. She worked for United Nations.,0
"Please, don't watch this film, it is bias and very racist ( to the Japans ). I was forced to watch'Changi'last year in year 10 Australian History.",0
"Every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu. So why is "" Changi "" a monumental failure? The "" Ausiness 5 million Aust. "". "" The story cuts between past events, and the present day, when the aged veterans plan a reunion. Changi "" is an Australian comedy / drama set in the World War 2 Japanese prisoner of war camp of that name. This borrowing happened so often, it smacked of lazy writing by cut and paste, rather than homage.",0
What percentage survived? They made the Jews of Belsen look like sumo wrestlers. This was a very good show. Great performances by fine cast cannot redeem this lightweight screenplay. I have met several veterans from Changi over the years.,0
! MILO!!!!,0
"Just shows you how low they're going to get as much attention as possible for the movie. < br / > < br / > What mistakes did the movie make? The killer is a strange young boy named Milo Jeeder. He had the potential of being a very freaky character. Sadly, this movie isn't all that it got my excited about.",0
The music is honestly cheesy. There are no - NO redeeming qualities to this film. The plot is beyond belief.,0
"By the time the movie was over, I was willing to rate it no more than a "" 1 "". This is easily one of the worst films I've seen in many years. < br / > < br / > Don't waste your time or money on this one. In fact, it ended up delivering even less than I expected.",0

"This movie sucked sooo bad, I couldn't even watch the ending.",0
This has got to be the worst horror movie I have EVER seen. I guess not.,0

Stay away from this movie at all costs.,0

Typical story of an evil kid going after people. It'ninety minutes to two hours that I'll never get back.,0
"Peace. If you watch this movie, it will definitely make you stupider.",0
"So now, she sets off to find out the horrifying truth. Especially, since the plot is rather absurd, but that's not its main problem. This when our main character keeps on seeing the figure of her past in a slicker. Hey, I'll admit it had its moments, but hardly enough to make it neither effectively chilling, or memorable. More like irrelevant scenes and yawn inducing clichés that we see from time to time. Although, maybe it was too serious? No! Well, guess what?",0

He could have been scary, but just how scary can a villain be who wears a yellow raincoat? One of the group volunteers to be Milo's "" first patient "" and he leads her behind closed doors. Return to Miloville. Enter the lovely Jostyn who plays one of the girls all grown up in present day. Yep!",0
This movie was horrible. Absolutely horrible.,0

"The only action that is in the movie is what is in previews. This movie didn't even come close in the like category. We weren't as smart as the 7 or 8 people who did walk out. I cannot say enough to make people not waste their money. Hard to explain what I mean, but trust me it was awful.",0
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.,0
"This movie had potential, but blew it like a teenager turning to drugs. Wait for it to come on TV before you see it. My advice?",0
She's running against a candidate who has plenty of money. < br / > < br / > This story moves slowly and painfully. Doesn't anybody mourn anymore? She's a politician - she can't be bogged down by feelings. We don't want to know about Dutch's police investigations.,0

This one is a waste of time and energy. His co - star was very good and had the better lines.,0
"Even score was incongruous and jarring. I don't have a problem with this ; in fact, I sort of feel it's a privilege. What a waste.",0
What a disappointing movie.,0
I wanted my money back from the video store...,0
"They seemed to be uncomfortable unless they threw in some gun battles and bar fights. Indeed, the subplots had nothing to do with the story at all. After all, we all know how boring "" Casablanca "" was. They were like commercial breaks in which you watched a trailer for another movie.",0

Complete nonsense.,0
"The very ending left me scratching my head. From what I understand, it's like a different movie altogether. The idea of Michael being controlled by the Druids is intriguing. Paul Rudd is solid as Tommy Doyle, whose appearance is a neat tie - in with the original. What the hell happened? It's not a pretty sight. This is what you get when you put a shameless hack in charge of a motion picture.",0
"The music, on of Halloween's highlights even when film is bad, is tortured in this film. < br / > < br / > Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that I liked. I wish it didn't exist.

This is also due to the lack of some real good gore. < br / > < br / > So far worst out of the series! Man, the'90's really were an horrible decade for movies. He does his usual stuff again but without too much class or originality. It's a real shame that this had to be Donald Pleasence last film - role.",0
"It'worthless. Really! A gigantic mess that loses itself halfway and can't retrace. Just stay as far, repeat, far away as possible from this movie. Who thought that it would ever come to this? What can I say about Ocean's Twelve?",0
Why does Michael put one victim's clothes in a washing machine? Does getting electrocuted really make your head explode? And so on. Why does an otherwise empty corridor have a deadly spike sticking out of the wall?,0
"Two people can watch the same movie with one of them loving it and the other one hating it. Direction, script, acting are of the lowest strata imaginable. As it concerns'Halloween : the Curse of Michael Myers'I fall into the latter category. He seems drained of all his energy and resigned to the fact that this may be his last film. Maybe that's what killed him. Taste is a subjective thing.",0
"I even read someone saying it was just as good as the original. Why? Yet, in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels. OK where should i start, ah yes the plot oh boy the plot. Why does Michael Myers got to have a reason for killing people?",0

"Bah, I clearly chose the wrong key. I have long tried to understand why people like Shakespeare so much and every few years I give him another go. < br / > < br / > One day, I might just find a Shakespeare play that does something other than bore me. At every step, the plot is laid bare two scenes in advance. But I felt nothing for the characters.",0
"I have to admit that although I'm a fan of Shakespeare, I was never really familiar with this play. The big problem however that over - rides everything in this film is just a lack of emotional focus.",0
It was RIVETING.,0
"I would much rather see the work adapted for its rich language and storytelling without any whitewashing. I am a Shakespeare lover since childhood. Therefore I expect a movie based on this play to play it straight. As final proof, the happy ending is where the Jew loses his money and is forced to convert to Christianity. < br / > < br / > I acknowledge this and move on. Pacino is way out of his league and is very uncomfortable with the language, not to mention the I am also a Jew.",0

"The story is from the garbage can of Hollywood, and the characters are uninteresting to boot. Avoid at all costs. I'm a pretty tolerable guy, when it comes to movies, even B movies. The attempts at comic relief are painfully unfunny. There was no thought behind this movie, no innovation, it's just there. I really didn't mind that they were ripping off the Core to some extent, but they did absolutely nothing interesting with the material.",0
"It's a Sci - Fi Network movie, so the script is paint by numbers disaster movie. This movie borrows from "" The Core "" and from the film it borrowed from, "" Armageddon "", and the films it borrowed from and so on. This was pretty inevitable. Not original and not all that entertaining.",0

"Shakespeare meets ghetto. The Play Macbeth was written by William Shakespeare between the years of 1604 and 1606. Before the festivities begin, Lady Macbeth ( Victoria Hall ) talks Macbeth into killing Duncan to take power over the throne. Akira Kurosawa even directed a Japanese version of Macbeth in 1957 entitled, "" Kumonosu jô. "" After his murder, Macbeth takes all of Duncan's belongings including hid title and crown. That's right!",0
"I honestly didn't care about Macbeth while watching the film. The film's major fault is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of Macbeth is in a word... boring. < br / > < br / > OK, first things first. Macbeth kills his master and then assumes his crown.",0
The story of Macbeth was one of the most successful Shakespeare ever wrote. This 2006 movie is no exception. The worst part in the film are the lines. The play would seem ideal to base a movie on. Unfortunately this has not been the case with Macbeth. No knights in shiny armor but gangsters in shiny cars.,0

"Apparently not. The ending was awful. That being said, Krasinski was great.",0

That is the high school that everyone else went to. I love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great American sitcom. Or did you go to the high school that had middle - aged people teaching in it? No.,0
The humor in this show seems like it is trying to target an audience with an I. Q. of 40 or below. This is just my opinion but i think these guys should stop now before they humiliate themselves anymore than they have already.,0
The rest of the cast is equally bad.,0

I will rate the movie 4 out of 10. I enjoy watching Robert Forster. I couldn't get interested in the characters.,0

Any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and peripheral. Before I continue, two things, I accept that some filmmakers like to subvert generic expectations, here this is simply not the case. Overall, I found the script lacking in many respects.",0
This is a poor film. Avoid at all costs.,0
What I would add is that the film skimmed surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them. On a positive note the performances and music were very good. The balance sheet might have been pretty but the viewing experience was poor.,0
"So he walked out and got a cab. This is something that can't happen, and if it did, it wouldn't prevent the computer from working. The overall storyline was as unoriginal and predictable as a pack of sausages. The few attempts to make the dialogs sound intelligent, was limited to neurotic, apologetic behavior. A ten year - old might like it.",0
He trades with isolated villages by performing Shakespeare.,0

No spark, no sizzle, not even a post - mortem twitch. Clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope. Screwball comedies need a fast pace, not necessarily frenetic, but moving briskly along at all times. Here, things drag, and drag, and drag.

"Although this attempt at least tried to show a more historic accurate Nero than the amusing but completely fictitious Nero Peter Ustinov played in "" Quo Vadis! "" He did not murder Britannicus. Nero did NOT burn Rome, this is proved! it still is a major failure.

"At that time, his mother, Agrippina, is exiled by Caligula. Nero loses his father, is raised by slaves. At these moments of the movie, we see Acte ( Rike Schmid ), Nero's mistress.

"Okay, it was very good... but Best Picture? < br / > < br / > Wake up, whoever you are. Hollywood IS mainstream, and that's what happened to the Box Office in 2005. That film has been done, since the early 1960's and we have to make that the best film? Pathetic. Many voters apparently didn't even see Brokeback Mountain. That's why we have a complete moron in office in the US.",0
"don Cheadle is always good. i find nothing interesting about her. i would not recommend this film to anyone, what waste of time. the minute the opening sequence started i knew i was in trouble. Brendan Fraser was fine. some performance were good.",0

"It's not even good porn either, besides being far too soft it's dull, boring & the not - worth - mentioning sex scenes are few & far between.

I just felt like I've been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is. I get it. THE GOOD : The acting were great especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton.,0
"i am amazed anyone likes this film. Paul Haggis is a hack. they exist only as objects, surprise.",0
"Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents girly. "" Part two has spoilers. < br / > < br / > The rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous. Race. Racism. It reminds me more of the convenience store clerk from The Doom Generation. "" Is it realistic?",0
It was so predictable. The morals of the story were PC to max. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. It wasn't all bad.,0
"Awful, just awful. No subtly at all. I could go on and on.",0
It is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its pretentiousness. Please. This behavior is evil.,0

"Not a lesson about ethnic diversity however... the lesson I learned is "" Don't trust reviews "". until you can tell film is winding down. Let's face it people. The flaming car scene was well executed, like much of the movie, but went nowhere in the end.",0
"Cotten, of course, is a complete madman.",0
"I can see that Haggis'intentions with this film were honorable, but dare It's utterly unconvincing and obvious. These characters all speak using the same voice and all they ever talk about is racism. Does Haggisreally think we are so dumb as to require a shot of the blanks? Can we not be left to make someleaps in logic for ourselves? That is irrelevant.",0
< br / > < br / > The phone rings. This movie is bad. Repeat.,0
BUT........ This movie was horrid and at the end made me wonder why someone went to the trouble to make it.,0
The old man was being harassed but the VIEWER was too! At first the film was interesting to me but it deteriorated VERY quickly.,0
"99 % of it is spewed from Willingham himself. I recently watched this film on The Sundance Channel and it kept me interested from the start. Do see it, if only one time. One, the movie has more foul language than Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino, and Glengarry Glen Ross combined. However, if you're like me, you'll be saying "" Triple K Marine!

"Only, how the hell did the fingers get in the salad? And wasn't the Blood Cult's purpose to collect the appendages they severed? Hitting the ground running, the film begins with THREE murders in a row. When the GORE stops making sense, you know you're in trouble. The basic reaction is to try to put it behind you and get on with your life. This is a high point.",0
That was extremely distracting. What can I say?,0
"I only watch this movie when I am angry at myself. Yes, I've seen bad acting. This is the most boring intro I've ever seen. I cried like a baby. There's a lot of suspense and build up before some girl dies. True horror. TRUST ME. < br / > < br / > The lead actor makes me ill.",0

A salty wealthy older woman who helped Loy start her business, she has an acquaintance with Powell and can see immediately through Loy's cool claims that she loathes him. Rice and Beal are a boring couple, and the whole premise of Powell getting between them is senseless. Sounds good so far, right? When Loy says she doesn't have time to both run her business and have a man in her life, its a groaner.

30 minutes into the film and I couldn't take any more.,0
"Hawking himself has commented that "" It is rubbish. But if not, I think would be boring for you. At least I'm disabled. "" It is just media hype.",0
This is the very definition of dullness.,0

Tommy was hugely talented and, from all accounts, often an overbearing jerk. Why spend a moment slogging through this awkward and self - conscious movie? Tommy, superb on trombone, and Jimmy, superb on saxophone, usually couldn't stand each other. They reconciled when their father died in the Forties, which is where the movie ends. They later managed to tolerate each other in the orchestra led by Tommy as big band era faded out in the Fifties. Each had greater success alone than they had achieved together.",0

Nothing much happens in this film. So if you'male I don't recommend this film to you. This is more of a Chick Flick than anything else. The problem is that this movie is very predictable.,0

"B - sides, anyone? Only Samina Awan in the lead role manages to impress in a cast of so - called British talent that we'll probably never hear from again. At least, that's the hope. We get many, many musical montages which telegraph how we're suppose to feel.",0
"This felt a little awkward and silly, and seemed at odds with the'realism'used in the style of shooting. The characters were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance. It has become almost a safe option. The subject matter could be an interesting basis for a film. However, the delivery of this appeared naive and unfocused.

"The movie just goes to show Hollywood can'get anything right without dumbing it down and adding a happy ending. And drug addiction is treated as shlock, exploitavely. The acting is decent, especially the snakelike Louie, who is more menacing in the movie than the book. And it should have remained the only story of Division Street and Frankie Machine. The movie is a dumbed - down, completely different take on Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When this happens, Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow, all lose their psychological edge.",0
< br / > < br / > Sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise. My suggestion to you : WATCH SOME BEAUTIFUL CINEMAS MADE AROUND THE GLOBE.,0
< br / > < br / > Buy at Own Risk. I finally watched the rest of it the next day and unfortunately the 2nd half was every bit as lame as the first. I was extremely disappointed and shocked at how thrown together this film was. Kronks New Groove in all honesty did nothing for me nor my girlfriend and we both loved the first.,0
not even close to the first one.,0
"If you loved the original, or are looking forward to the upcoming TV series about Kuzco, I recommend Kronk to his loyal fans. This all leads up to Kronk confronting his father and his disapproval over his son's direction in life. It takes away much time that could be spent at creating a more enjoyable film. In this movie, Kronk learns a great deal of lessons at many others'expenses.",0
"It was not. Seriously, this movie was bad.",0
"Hoped it would be as good as the first one, but... I'm sorry to tell this, but the more the humour got American, the more I yawned. ( I'll ignore Rudy... for as far that's possible ).",0
"To save the day, a little help from his friends. Kronk is worried, because he knows that his life won't impress his Papi.",0
"The original songs are uninspired and sickly cute. There's almost no humor targeted towards adults. < br / > < br / > Now, I never expected to like the first movie. ... but of course I was wrong.",0
It wasn't a musical!,0
< br / > < br / > Avoid at all costs!,0
"Only, they get locked in the store, along with the weirdo. Instead, it started out fresh, and sure did have plenty of action sequences, but wound up verging on the ridiculous. This is the story of a maniac cop who, for some reason, has it in for a young college stud and his mates.",0
"He shouldn't really be blamed for this confused, poor movie because all the problems lie in Brendan Somers script. It's ill focused and lazily written.",0
"The other real problem is concept, concept is very important, it is the reason you believe in dinosaurs coming to life or a corpse full of stitches that just wants to live, the main concept about snakes that want revenge after decades on torture by the human civilization, well... hmmm, just doesen't glues on the wall.",0
"The snake attacks themselves also never happen on screen (.. one or two tops ), or are so limply presented they leave little impression. There are plenty of better horror films featuring snakes as the aggressors than SNAKE ISLAND. The other cast members serve as either tourists or crew, mostly fodder for the snakes. That's a no - no for a genre such as this. Kate Connor is Crawford's attractive love interest, a lawyer on vacation. < br / > < br / > As in many other movies of this type, director Crawford features live snakes with computer generated ones, and the violence is really tame.",0
"Do not pay to rent this. Now we know where they got the idea of Snakes on a Plane. Whether they were real or CGI generated, they did look pretty good.",0
"These aren't mutant snakes. And while they dance nude and such, the snakes hunting them all of a sudden stop and start jamming along to it. Did your draw drop again? It became very quickly very early on that this movie was going to be awful, but it condescended below even those expectations.",0
"It's not like there ever was ONE main snake. Don't waste your time. Oh, they never do get gas by the way. Just, "" It's bad. "" They just stop there to let off the writer.",0
"< br / > < br / > The characters are so unlikeable I was begging for the snakes to finish these horrible people off to put us all out of our misery. That is one thing I will give this movie, there are snakes, LOTS and LOTS of snakes of all sizes and kinds. < br / > < br / > Avoid this movie like the plague unless you are really into movies that feature lots and lots of snakes and really horrible humans.",0
Snake Island is just so bad that it is excruciating. Snake Island is the other kind of bad.,0
The drama is at a minimum. They talk like a perfect teenager would. Lets give that a reality check. < br / > < br / > Come on Nick. Mini fridges. 1 ) The Boarding School is perfect.,0
"That's mean and it just influences young girls to act mean to totally nice people. That's not funny! Lola seems to be able to fool anything with her Emmy - deserving acting skills. That raw plot line is, I'll admit, a pretty good idea. Chase and Michael are very similar, and I even sometimes get them confused. Dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is just plain mean. < br / > < br / > In conclusion, Zoey 101 was poorly written and should have spent a few more years in the drafting process. At most boarding schools, if a boy were to go into a girl's dorm or vice versa they would be expelled.",0
Zoey 101 is such a stupid show.,0
"If you're not perfect like Zoey, you're unworthy * rollseyes *. What message does this show bring to kids? I couldn't bring my self to sit through 3 episodes of Zoey101.",0
"The only characters I seemed to like were Dustin, Quinn, Stacey, Michael & Logan.",0
"I strongly dislike this show. anyways, Jamie Lynn spears CANNOT act. really!",0
"The characters. < br / > < br / > Take for example the first episode. Zoey is a pretty, popular, tan, blonde young teen who everyone just LOVES! The boys want to ask her out, the girls want to be her friend, etc. Most annoying of all : her voice is so darn bubbly and obnoxious. "" < br / > < br / > Don't even get me started on Jamie Lynn's role as ZOEY. Are.",0
"The few words I spent on each of these characters sum up each character entirely. These plots often play off stereotypes, such as any character who pulls good grades in math must by default completely lack social skills. As is the tradition amongst kids networks, the cast is an array of skinny white kids, with the token black guy, of course. The majority of episodes have the continuous and overused will - they won't - they Chase - Zoey dynamic.",0
It really is super lame. This show sucks.,0
What's with this generation?? BORING!!! ? Zeoy101? / 2005?,0
Jamie Lynn Spears looks more like a tooth pick in tube top.,0
Sounds more like a villain to me! A SUSHI BAR. The jokes are old sooooo old too!,0
"But that is not the worst. Moving on. I don't know why, but it is. This show is very annoying.",0
"Too bad none of this makes her likable. Yeah, this show basically spews out stereotypes. Oh, and it's in Malibu.",0
What happened to Dan Schneider? And I did NOT like the episodes I saw.,0
"First of all, I just don't understand Zoey's character. < br / > < br / > Next, the characters. This television show is stereotypical and far - fetched in many of its aspects. I have friends in boarding schools, and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this show.",0
Now let's talk about the show. You can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is! Zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows I've ever seen!,0
"Every episode consists of boy problems, situations that they caused themselves, and troubles that should be solved. Lola is a clone of Nicole. The kids in this show are rarely seen in class and there doesn't seem to be any real teachers. Chase is dumb. Each character is a stereotype. There is nothing here to be amazed or surprised at. A sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat screen TVs in every room, cool dorms to hang out, etc. I've been through school and I can tell you, nobody is like that. Why not use some originality?",0
"I've seen this programme a few times and the more a see of it, the less I like it. Sorry, it's too mature and yet too dumbed down. There is nothing original about this and it's poured with money, so every kid there has the coolest of fashions and stuff.",0
Welcome to the life of Zoey Brooks and her friends.,0
Perhaps the people who have never seen it are the lucky ones? What caused the catastrophe? I have no idea. < br / > < br / > As for the rest of the plot it's very routine.,0
Can't they just be normal! 3. The acting is horrible.,0
"It could not get any more diabolic than this. Right, where do I start? However, I will give her some face, because her superficial, one dimensional character, does not allow much room for depth. Both left the show in seasons 2 and 1 respectively, not that I blame that. I cannot even imagine to comprehend this preteen pathetic excuse of a show.",0
And her friend Nicole is an overly perky freak that screams a lot. Might as well shave off the hair chase. No one is that rich and lives at a dorm off the pacific coast. < br / > < br / > This show is big thumbs down. She is always perfect at everything including her perfect figure.,0
"How pathetic. This makes the show so unrealistic, and boring. Quinn is so obnoxious. Chase is such a wimp. She is so perfect. I think no. The plots are pointless, and incredibly boring. It is so annoying.",0
She's always perfect and no one is like that in real life.,0
"I'm afraid that the Iraqi people that this film represents have been edited to speak with a Yankee voice. Never was it disclosed that any of that 10 - 20 % were Saddam's Henchmen or curfew violators. I am afraid that the cutting room floor Everyone should see it. Nor does it mention that 20, 000 civilians have died due exclusively to US artillery. Well there's a few things about this movie. Its true that some Iraqis actually get paid a good wage. I agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this film shows that same distortion. Still 15 % of the country which once had running water and electiricity now does not. Just as its true that no Iraqi people have control of their most prized oil and US corporations do.",0
Something so simple as a Google search. Was the left - leaning art house crowd one of those constituencies?,0
"It's a mystery why he just keeps saying "" it was personal "" when faced with angry and disappointed women. < br / > < br / > c ) the underlying legal assumptions are nonsense. HUH? It's ugly stuff because the values, the ideals, of the screenplay are all so harmful.",0
"A small part in a major movie would be of more benefit to him than this rubbish. Why does he pick stuff like this? He's a hit - man in other words. Put it this way - Tom Cruise had a bit part in "" The Outsiders "" while Howell had the lead. < br / > < br / > The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode. Look at Cruise today!!! Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.",0
"The premise of the film sounds good. In short, don't waste your time.",0
Suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent. What were they thinking? It is a tale like CAMILLE. < br / > < br / > Only for Garbo fans.,0
< br / > < br / > The acting was so overdone. I was completely disappointed.,0
"But it isn't successful. But to me it just gives me a feeling of indifference. The characters, in my opinion doesn't come off as being credible at all. The cinematography is poor, and the acting even more so.",0
"no its not. The guy mentioned to sue for the 1. To think of a man who actually wrote this story, sick. But this one is like a bad remake copy of saw with a bad ending. If you ever saw the movies saw? does not. Its mere the brutality and the violence that made me sick.",0
The plot didn't exist and neither did the acting. I couldn't be further from the truth. Like jumping off of building. 00 and told them to make a movie.,0
She doesn't make it out of town. Dark and dank basement. Fearful survival.,0
"< br / > < br / > Film quality could have been better, but the acting was pretty decent.",0
"I say "" flick "" because this doesn't deserve the appellation "" movie "", and certainly not "" film "". Talk about a poor memory! No tension, pithy religious ( what religion? )",0
So I really hope the creators of the movie actually read this!,0
Each scene was about 20 minute of the same thing and I felt I got the point after the first 5. This is definitely a film without motive that was shot poorly and very drawn out. Especially ones with lots of unnecessary nudity.,0
They should have a payment program for people who accidentally rent this movie. 5 hours of my life back.,0
"You couldn't really make out what was going on. Then you will hear the girl sobbing. But honestly people, this was a Saw meets Blair Witch Project wannabe. All you know that its a basement somewhere. That was an understatement. The not the best movie in the world???? I wanna see some stuff in a movie. ! But one of the things in the movie that I hated.. was that it was sooooo dark.",0
< br / > < br / > The story is good. The sound is muffled and often times not understandable. Huston was obviously trying too hard and if anything it resembled a bad film school project. Billy Bob from Silence of the Lambs treated his victims better than Netwon. Having to result to camera and lighting the way he did was a sign of over the top syndrome. I have to start out by saying that the actresses and actor did a fine job for what they worked with.,0
Not too many. Because they had no script. Why?,0
Dark Reality is a Saw like movie that is slightly decrepit.,0
"This should have seemed a tired, sad concept in 1993, never mind 2003. The budget does really show - which in this day and age should not.",0
"Louis B. Mayer forgot to tell Vincent Minnelli he was directing a thriller, not a musical. End result : Metro's "" Parnell "" of 1940s. Misguided, miscast, murky, interminable lunacy given the high - gloss MGM A - budget treatment. Karl Freund's ravishing cinematography creates images of eerie beauty - - and was wasted on the wrong film. Taylor is embarrassing.",0
Her attempts come across as silent Gish while Taylor's wide descent into madness takes on restrained Bela Lugosi. < br / > < br / > Undercurrent resembles a few Hitchcock plots but Vincent Minnelli rapidly establishes he is no master of suspense. Minnelli never really succeeds in getting Kate to defer in desperate fashion to Taylor's limited abilities as an actor. Robert Mitchum completes the miscasting as the sensitive brother. Talk about piling on. She soon finds out there is a lot she does not know about him.,0
They both are obviously and blissfully in love. - - of the men around her. Sounds like we might have a good 80 minute noir.,0
Ultimately a waste of space.,0
The only interesting thing about this movie was my dog barking at surround sound. The directing style has been done to death ( The fisheye camera ).,0
Why? He plays maybe 30 seconds of screen time and his role is completely irrelevant. I still don't understand what the writer / director meant to say. Are they ghosts? But that is where this movie goes no further! The story is even worse.,0
The acting was flat and the story lacked depth. I have to agree with the other negative comments.,0
). This movie is total dreck.,0
I want my 82 minutes back. Wow.. where do I begin. This film ( if you can call it that ) is a bona fide waste of time.,0
Total waste of time.,0
Gallo is amazing in it. While in Madrid I was able to see a screener copy of this film. The problem is Val is really only in one scene. I have only seen Stranded of the directors other films. Wow!,0
Worst introduction : canned laughter.,0
I am disappointed in Vincent Gallo. Why they were searching for the gates of hell only the director knows. I don't know how films like this get released Video or Pay Channel. It is like Marlon Brando in Superman. If they had a Zero out of 10 I would of entered it.,0
"Oh, and out of interest, there were no special effects. From hell.",0
"Horrifyingly bad. Not that it mattered much. Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back! Yes, this movie is a horror. < br / > < br / > HERE'S YOUR SPOILER : And the ending, holy mother ( no pun intended ) it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming.",0
Nothing makes sense in this movie.,0
"The idea is really good, the performances are fine, the script goes nowhere. The gate to Hell has opened up under Moscow.",0
"Could they have find a more boring plot? It's dark, and it's mystical and murky. This line is a good summary of this movie. However, the rest of the movie is really dull.",0
What a mistake! It's simply nonsense and proves the lack of talent of director. I suffered the watching of this movie at Sitges Festival last month. His character don't have specific weight in the movie.,0
the movie has no sense at all!,0
And Val Kilmer?,0
"He enlists the help of a series of locals who, with the exception of Oksana Akinshina, are all portrayed by Spanish actors trying with limited success to inflect Russian accents.",0
"In truth, the character resembles a drag queen, not someone in the midst of transitioning. I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that. At the very least, why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender... Some spoilers * * * * A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least.",0
That's about the same as watching this subterranean search for the Devil's door. Sit in your basement with the light out for an hour and a half.,0
There is no point in even writing about what is in the film as that has already been done. Keep your money sanity and keep well clear.,0
My vote is one.,0
"In short, the movie is tedious to watch.",0
This movie is just such a film.,0
"It is never boring and manages to generate more than a little interest in seeing what will come next. Although not too far off the mark, this is most definitely not true.",0

But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic.,0
"Who knows. Thankfully he is a decent actor and a pleasure to watch. Was this a Sci - Fi casting move to try and draw fans from the other show? The seem low on budget, originality, and plot.",0
He walks through the part and it is hard to understand why he bothered.,0
"But wait, there's worse news! This is pretty much it for the plot. This movie is the very worst that I have ever seen.",0
"If you have to see it you will understand why. And I have seen this movie three times, staying awake throughout. This movie is, in all likelihood, the worst film ever made. I feel I should be congratulated.",0
"It was laughable. Terrible, terrible, terrible! I think the director was trying to fill time. The worst thing was the way the Bigfoot looked.",0
"There is nothing even remotely interesting in this piece of crap. Avoid this horrible junk like the plague. The film is extremely dull and filled with horrible songs and cheap special effects. No gore, no suspense - just gigantic boredom.",0

However, that being said, it is also a miracle of a film when you consider that this thing was crafted by an entire community. Sure, I could examine the script which is just ridiculous.

Well I guess it is not so modern earth now and that it is an ancient world now of strangeness and a den of good times gone by. The only thing this one has going for it is the animals which are not as prevalent in this one as they were in the last. Well I guess I can figure why they did in fact place nearly all the movie in modern times in this and that movie.",0
I don't understand what the big hype was about this film. The jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible. 1980's horror is the past and should stay in the past.,0
"< br / > < br / > Technically it falls short in a couple of places. Unlike "" Holloween "" ( 2007 ) we got to meet the people and care what happened to them. The same can be said for Tony Todd. The alligator attack seen was shoot too dark.",0

Arghhhh! < br / > < br / > what i didn't get was why didn't they just kill the damned thing while it was unconscious, instead they just walked away from it like idiots and left it so it could come back and kill them. i mean it was just way too retarded, it was like the writer didn't know where he wanted the story to go.",0
It thankfully stays away from Torture Horror. HATCHET is a movie of betweenness. It's between ultra violent and violent comic book. This movie is on just better than the HorrorFest releases and should not be so bloated. Creature effects and make - up are silly - probably on purpose. It's between SHAUN OF THE DEAD and LESLIE VERNON.,0
Mr. Bean is just a bunch of unfunny slapstick humour. Watching this is an aggravating experience.,0
This is one of the worst films I've seen for years. The storyline has potential that is never realized.,0

The main problem with the movie is that it's boring. They got blackmailed maybe?,0

There is nothing wrong with that in itself ; as an actress she was up to the part. It's like The Blue Angel plus a kid. As usual Sternberg's interiors are dressed and shot to look like either brothels or insane asylums. Like any genre, they have their outright masterpieces, as well as their absolute turkeys. It's just that nothing else about the format has changed. In spite of this being one of the handful of pictures for which he also took a writing credit, Sternberg simply fails to get the story - arc.",0

"Stay Alive does some things well ; the character development is quite a bit deeper than it usually would be in a horror movie. The film is also very suspenseful.

"The plot also had inconsistencies. If you know someone like that you can watch it with at laugh at, do it. This movie was not very good in my opinion. Otherwise, stay far far away. Funny how they never bothered to do that and still managed to escape. It would have been okay for the brother's death, just to get them playing again.",0
"I tried. Overall, however, it was not really very scary. This film just never resolved the basic plot points and thats the writer's job.",0

Parts : The Clonus Horror is not that bad of a movie. Sadly it was botched in production and ended up on MST3K.,0
No chemistry with the love interest and so bland you almost don't care what happens to him. In 2004 someone tried to make this mess all over again it was called The Island... The lead is an actor i have never seen in anything else and it shows.,0

It just so happens he's a clone of the brother of Peter Graves. I'll say this first... the film would've been a 70s sci - fi classic if it had been executed a lot better. The reporter guy and his wife are killed in the middle of an exciting conversation by a bomb. ).",0
And then there's the clones themselves. Parts : The Clonus Horror is a horror all right.,0

"So now we know the purpose of the film is the build up of it's horror. Then, we cut to the present, where the film's style takes over. Yeah, the movie is okay to look at. And it's a decent build up, for the most part. Soavi is a bit of a hack. He's never gone back. In fact, his best film - 1994's Cemetery Man - was probably his least successful.",0

"Sciorra is very natural in the role, but unfortunately, the script lets her down. Annabella Sciorrra is terrific as the asthmatic Claire.

And Ida is a real spoiled bi - otch throughout - just a 100 % turnoff. I felt sad for the rest of the actors.,0
There's not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie! Huh? Miscast is Ida Lupino in the leading role! From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!,0
It has to be the worst horror flick either of us had ever seen.,0
"BUT, in this film, it's much hokier and ridiculous. However, technically this is an inept movie serial from start to finish - - produced by 3rd - rate writers, actors and crew. This movie earns its 3 for lousy writing, poor technical merit and continuity problems.",0

There is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall, standing in the sun. And maybe that'what the film is about. The opening scene is of a man walking in a field, and it lasts four minutes of movie time. It is repeated 15 times, with very sparse dialogue. All the movies at the theater are action - packed. ).",0
"Why anyone would want to sit through this is beyond me. Bacall's gold - digging is so forced, it's annoying to listen to. Grable's stupidity is also too ham - fisted to be believed. The characters are cardboard.",0
"But the film's premise is lame. What were they thinking? But there were lots of shots using rear screen projection, contributing to a dated look. But Lauren Bacall was too old for the role she played. And the orchestra plays on, and on, and on. < br / > < br / > I don't mind the shallow theme. And the execution is worse. Maybe in its day this movie was special.",0
"First, a warning. You won't miss anything. Where's Billy Wilder when you need him? Well, no. The title alone is perfect. One of dates is married. There are no comic situations, just isolated moments that play for laughs. If in doubt, have Marilyn walk into a wall.",0
"I couldn't see how her breast added to the drama of the scene or the film. First, the "" American "" uniforms did not look anything like U. S. Army uniforms. I think I would probably not hate this movie if I spoke Polish. To exacerbate the issue, some of the dialogue had no subtitles at all.",0

This is the basis of the show. The most money I've ever seen them hand out was $ 210. Playmania is extremely boring. This show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made.,0
The beginning ( of the film ) had some truth in it.,0
"Battle of the Eagles "" is a rare, low - budget look at the formation and exploits of the Partisan Air Force.

"By "" normal "" they actually mean "" ordinary and tedious "". A lot of episodes are merely dull, and some are unwatchable.",0
But that's OK with Doc because he knows these old wenches give good bread. Mary is another hot chick who all the guys sneak a peek at whenever she takes shower or a crap. A family of dirt - farmers moves out west.,0

"because, apparently it seems that he is happy as he is, with a well settled life, and a hobby to recreate. that part of Vijay, trying to gain some refreshers to his humdrum life is absolute bullshit. Why, because Jiah was so immature and childish, and Bacchan, mixed up guilty, and unsure. Why the title is Nishabd?",0
"However, the treatment is totally unrealistic.",0

"It's simple. Okay, I haven't read the book yet but I have to say that the lead character was miscast. How can I say such a thing haven't read the book you ask?",0
The whole exercise is pointless. Why make the film at all?,0
"I just could not. She badly overplayed that crucial scene and I actually felt sorry that Henry Crawford ever cared for her. The scene she has with her uncle where she breaks down in hysterics was hysterical. She had no appeal and at times appeared to be either lost in space or out of her depth. This was due to the total lack of acting ability by the actress, Sylvestra Le Touzel. As much as I wanted to like this Fanny.... < br / > < br / > The polar opposite is the portrayal of Mary Crawford by Jackie Smith - Wood.",0
He is also too effeminate. Rushworth is also perfect. Mary Crawford is brilliant. Poor Fanny!,0
The story is boring. It is now all about making money. It is the fall of an empire. There is no more Disney spirit.,0
The writers step on the throat of many of their gag.,0
"I am, however, so glad that I caught it on DVD and watched the special features. I laughed the whole time. Do yourself a favor and listen to it!",0

Overall a disappointment.,0
"The End. D "" I just wish I maybe had not have seen it.",0

"This movie is watchable, but nothing special. The ending was just as lame as the rest of the movie. < br / > < br / > There's not nearly enough gore, and way too much rape.",0

It has very few weak spots and it'head and shoulders above this mess. This is sacrilege. He gets no support from Gilbert. Doris Roberts makes Mrs. Van Damm merely annoying. Gilbert ruins every scene she's in. Joan Plowright could have played this part beautifully.,0
"I'm sorry but James Coco cannot play drama. The first reviewer was correct... In this crappy remake, it took her under 10 seconds. Out of 10 stars, I give this remake 3. This remake is just that, a remake. Spiral staircase?",0

There is not one good sight gag. Someone should tell the director that. Comedy relies on timing.,0
"Boring and just not funny, sums it up nicely. A hope, which died with end credits.",0
This is sillier and more brain dead than a monkey's bottom. No... What awindle! This movie is a gross insult to the collective intelligence of humanity! What a sad surprise. Poor fool me.,0
"Yet another TV show becomes a movie. It is neither. Keep it up Hollywood! Thank God Don Adams is not here to see it. It is so unfunny, it is absolutely pathetic. Unless you are a Masochist, STAY AWAY.",0
"Don't believe the hype. Agent 99 and Maxwell ( except for their names ) are simply not the same characters. If you have high hopes or have anticipated this movie to any degree, you may be disappointed. Some left after 20 minutes.",0
Not even worth a free rental! Just awful! Don't waste your time. Who let this bomb escape? Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. Lots of wasted talent. This movie is in the same league as Ishtar.,0
"The movie lacks any creative random tech, and replaces it with crossbows in swiss army knives. In this one, he attacks without success and gets pummeled. The classic music is back, but now everything is updated, generally for the worse. In yet another miserable attempt to make a quick Hollywood cash - in of one of televisions greatest masterpieces, Peter Segal has created a monster. < br / > < br / > For those who have seen the original, the writers of this movie thought they'd include some memories.",0
"I loved Steve Carrell in Anchor Man, and I like his comedy and style. Nothing that struck me at all. < br / > < br / > Spoiler Alert! And that is what he does best, but it just didn't work here. What was he really expecting to do with that crossbow? This movie sucked.",0
"< br / > < br / > Aliens of London / World War Three - Doctor who degenerates into farce. Also, we are treated to a whole episode of Soap Opera. Let down solely by the Doctor and Rose. The pacing and script are all fine ( though the Doctor and Rose still irritate ). What more can be said. There's no plot to speak of, childish humour, mixed with some extremely bad pacing and incidental music. Not as bad as his previous efforts, but instantly forgettable. The effects and menace of the Dalek are introduced well.",0
"At other times, he acts like an imbecile.",0
"It keep me very mildly interested to see what was coming next, just to see! This is a poorly written and badly directed short film, pure and simple. BUT Not in this case, they spent some money and it shows.",0

Horrible filmmaking.,0

"It takes an incredibly long time before anything remotely interesting or significant happens. The set pieces, make - up effects and costumes are pitiable. So naturally, in this film a bunch of people are studying the behavior of human corpses when deep frozen. She's attracted to lousy B - movies like bees are to honey.",0
"True, her career didn't exactly skyrocket during the 80s ( sadly ), but this movie is an embarrassment for her. When I decided to try watching a movie about cryogenic zombies ( "" cryonoids "" ), I wasn't expecting a whole lot. < br / > < br / > How Linda Blair ended up stuck in the middle of this piece of dreck is indeed a mystery.

Andrew Gurland is a hack avoid or burn. No wonder it couldn't get a theatrical release.,0
"Just plain studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to GO! Thought I just might get a few laughs from this long drawn out film, but was sadly disappointed. I know this was suppose to be a comedy, but it never made me laugh and I thought the entire film was a COMPLETE WASTE OFIME!",0
"Watching with hopes to see if anything suddenly clicked. BTW, it seems odd to see Mary Tyler Moore as the principal. So, stylish as it is, I wouldn't recommend this movie. It didn't.",0
< br / > < br / > so.. deal for yourself!,0
"However, I've had my share of guilty pleasures, particularly when I was still in high school myself. < br / > < br / > This movie felt 3 hours long, the director never heard of pacing obviously.",0
"Doesn't that mean this show sucks? "" Another sing - song show! We needed another one. Think about it. Yay!",0

"Where to start with'Speck'the true story of Richard Speck, a killer of eight nurses in the 1960s. Incidentally Band introduced a special label for these films called'Shadow Entertainment '. The Tempe era features uniform Apple Mac editing and brutal hand - held camera filming, very much like a home movie.",0
3. It'very graphic and disturbing. This would have been impossible. In real life she hid under a bed while Speck methodically eliminated his 8 victims. Not true. Speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie. She is a very good actress.,0
"Your mileage may vary. Unfortunately, that doesn't make for a good movie.",0
Whether he ever learns what that is is up for interpretation. The story meanders through Hank's life without much thought given as to where to take the audience. However nothing should be taken away from Dillon. And that's a shame.,0
"I was a fan of Rourke at the time. Chinaski Barfly's hero scoffed at convention. Here is why Factotum Bukowski was my hero. At the time, this appealed to me. Bukowski takes the form of Chinaski in this novel. Some twenty or so years ago, Charles Bukowski was a hero of mine.",0
Good times. Nothing happens. Unfortunately he still can't hold down a job so soon enough he's broke. And then the movie's over and not a moment too soon. Too bad the movie which surrounds him is in fact rather bad. Dillon'performance actually isn't bad at all. As we meet Chinaski he may be a writer but he's certainly not a successful one.,0
"Filled with clichés and over familiar set pieces, the film also suffers from a cast that is largely misfiring. Peters gives it a right good go, and Paget lights up the screen with effervescent beauty. Out of 20th Century Fox, Anne Of The Indies is adapted by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass. Well it's not.",0
"Too many cheap BOO! The kids are not particularly deep but hey, that works for teens. This was a decent movie for the first half.",0

"< br / > < br / > The whole thing just didn't work. Next? Mediocre attempt at reinventing something that was brilliant, and you can't get past that. I like Marisa Tomei but she's no Faye Dunaway.",0
Dunaway's sleazy heroine Wanda is the perfect complement to ne'er - do - well Henry.,0
"I have waited a long time to see this movie. I thought it would be something like "" Barfly "" from Barbet Schroeder. That natural smart - ass attitude. Wrong. IFC finally ran it one night.",0
"< br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) : "" Factotum Sem Destino "" ( "" Factotum Without Destiny ) His primary and only objective is writing and having sexy with dirty women. My vote is four.

"Carey "" on, Coburn. < br / > < br / > One star. """,0
"* 1 / 2 from * * * * Flimsy stuff, indeed. Despite fine aquatic sequences filmed at Florida's Cypress Gardens, this romantic comedy is awfully stale. Carroll Baker, in her film debut as Martin's digruntled ex - girlfriend, is the liveliest of the bunch.",0
This isn't. Belushi is especially irritating.,0
"Try it, maybe you'll like it, probably you won't. The other cast members include character actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. 1st watched 12 / 26 / 2008 - ( Dir - Eugene Levy ) : Corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs. This isn't a horrible movie, it just isn't that good.",0
"Grade 2 out of 10 AN F! Oh, clever! No emotion, no laughs, no story. This flick, which is a. k. a. "" Otherwise, one of the 5 worst films I've seen.",0
"If this were something I was watching on TV, i'd be hooked right in. It will interest anyone who likes watching comics. He wasn't funny. It kept me looking at the screen.",0
Why? The gravity - gun doesn't work as a weapon. < br / > < br / > And I have a question : is THIS the next chapter of Half - Life? I liked Half - Life. Nowhere. Where are the intelligent enemies? I don't tell any news it is one the best FPS ever made.,0
"I was surprised. < br / > < br / > So I kept watching, and then Moore appeared and my supicions were confirmed. It just does not work. < br / > < br / > The film ends as suddenly and as badly as it started in the middle of a reel. The scene showed a dreadnought at sea with a German crew.",0
"See it if you want to weep, for loss of intelligence in American literature.",0
"Instead this innocence is replaced with pride, retaliation, and arrogance. Many transitions I felt were also over - stylized. < br / > < br / > Technically the film has a lot of problems however. In some ways Acolytes is very successful, but in many other ways the film fails miserably. < br Following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the film.",0
"His were the dog - days of James Bond. The rest isn't even hokum. Perhaps that is influencing my judgement - but not much. Here is a director who simply doesn't know where he's going. They must have been very, very desperate.",0
i also liked Ann Dvorak as Rita. anyway. i found it much too slow.,0
"Dvorak's leggy costume is film's greatest asset ; in it, she is a real mover. Mr. Scott has experience mediating between trail hands and saloon patrons. The cattlemen herd their wares, from Texas to the trail town of Abilene, Kansas.",0
"We must plead ignorance in regards to this title ; not having seen it up to this point. In short, he must have been the Dog Trainer on the set. ( Brilliant deduction, one fit for Holmes & Watson! ) I mean just how many poo ( Sorry, Schultz! ) SO THIS IS where Columbia's head of their Short Subjects Unit got his Directorial start, eh?",0
"The movie is really non - sense, no story line, and no nothing. < br / > < br / > Isn't it like The Bourne Identity? Mara Sokoloff, 'Dude Where's My Car ', is one of his trademark -'stupidity '. ( He should thank the series for his reputation ).",0

I know... reactions. ) Others have said enough about the plot.,0
Did I mention this movie was crappy? There ought to be some kind of prosecution to punish producers from financing screenplays this stupid. JUST KIDDING BELIEVE IN JESUS!,0
I would not recommend. According to this film he was. It is like a Canterbury Tale.,0
"Imagine Memento played by teen actors, but ten times more confusing and a hundred times less plausible. But, no sane person would like this script. It was not a treasure. Kidney's dying wish comes true when Dr. Garofalo gives him his own Walkman. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is definitely bumbling, but it never flies. I don't know if this was straight to video, but it should have been straight to the dump.",0
But the worst element of Bumblebee is the script. Cook's and Wood's relationship is laughable at best.,0
"There is little action or suspense until late in the film. Regardless, the film fails on most levels. Avoid at all costs.",0
The actors are terrible! I liked movies about mythological creatures. It's all improvised! This is really BAD!,0
Probably the worst movie I have ever seen.,0
This movie was a big disappointment. is incredibly annoying.,0
"is American, they all look European to me. or the lame performances. I swear, I had never seen such a bad movie as Half Caste is. By the way, I don't believe this cast ( or caste? ) This is the Blair Kittie project, with an expensive low budget.",0
"But no, it's not. Half - caste wasn't one of them. The last 20 minutes, though, are HILARIOUS. You won't miss anything.",0
"< br / > < br / > Definitely a Half - Aste effort. < br / > < br / > This movie tries to gain points for originality by exploring a more obscure myth and an exotic culture. Nobody else wants to see. That can work if you have good actors, which this film didn't.",0
"He was certainly disturbed by his loss, but that did not made him literally insane, delusional and detached from his friends and family. He was agnostic but did not think it was necessary "" to kill God "", only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. Of course, no such The such portrayal of Darwin is an invention of the script writer.",0
"Aside from the gunfight scene, I felt the movie was a waste of celluloid. Plus, why WASN'T she married already?",0
"Cult purchasers are unquestionably familiar with the term "" video nasties "". Enjoyable only if you're in the right mood, in other words. All that remains is a fairly amusing pulp - horror flick with awful acting and pointless sleaze.",0
So bad... well... it'just bad.,0
This is ( obviously ) a pretty stupid movie. Dr. Krellman wants to save his son Julio who's dying of heart disease. Still this does have merit. We're not talking classic here but an OK exploitation movie. We also get pointless female wrestling sequences that add nothing to the plot.,0
"This film was a Mexican made horror film from the late 60s. < br / > < br / > The film was kind of cheap, but not too bad for a b - movie of the day. It's not that good, but really not so bad either.",0
It has been a while since I had so much fun with such a bad film. The make - up of our Ape - Man is hilarious. ).,0
How can this be? It was intended as a social drama. Poor child. What a great comedy!,0
Rent'Fairy Tale '. That's the real story.,0
"They took this film totally seriously, which removed any possibility of enjoyment. I can't understand how any fan of either franchise could like this film. Against my own better judgment I went to see this film today, and God I wish I hadn't. < br / > < br / > Truly I don't know where to begin. Awful.",0
"The comedy never really hits, it only makes us scratch our heads. Which is a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. He brings a freshness to it and an entertaining time when the film really needs it. Campbell makes the film work well enough, even with the low - budget. I won't.",0
I bet I could!,0
"Then it goes downhill from there. Seriously, movie makers, do a good job with fight scenes and make it to where we can see the fight.",0
As for this..? Like the Black Death.,0
I don't recommend anybody to watch this.,0
"Then there's the 20 - something town sheriff ( Oh yeah, last season on JERICHO!!! AS IF. These face - huggers end up playing an intregal part in movie... of course.",0

AVP2 is an awful movie. < br / > < br / > BUT!,0
I loved the blood and gore. Its no big deal. This truly answers the question of how it would be like if aliens were on Earth. I thought that was rather stupid on the Predators part. I thought this was odd. < br / > < br / > 6 ) Why did only one Predator go? The effects were beautiful.,0
< br / > < br / > I wish I could say the same about this movie. ! < br / > < br / > Shame on you Bruce!! The whole idea is dumb.,0
Ed Wood is rolling over in his grave.,0
"Nope. < br / > < br / > I can safely say, this movie is a Stinker. Even the hot, bubble headed blond. Do you feel sorry for her? They are suppose to be high technology society, right? Major Plot hole! My qualifications for this review? The Predators are now idiots too. These scenes are laughable, not serious. Trophy kills.",0
"Predator a few years ago, I have to say as stupid as a sequel it was, it was still somewhat enjoyable. Go ahead and take it out on some Earthlings. So they crash and Alien is taking over the suburbia utopia.",0
"This film and the 1st AvP film both all over the whole Aliens and Predator franchise. Because Hollywood are idiots, thats why.",0
I couldn't here. From then on it gets really ridiculous. Predator was a great sci - fi / action mess - about. < br / > < br / > A father and son are hunting in the woods. When I say introduced I mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out.,0
"This movie moves along way too fast. < br / > < br / > Another problem is the settings and time frame. The Predator race sends down a lone highly experienced and armed Predator to "" clean up the mess "". Our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle.",0
with guns?? At the very least the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework. and of course in AVP - R we have teen slasher clichés.,0
"Alien vs. Because this film misses these three terms. Original, terrifying and classic. It was strained, illogical with full of meaningless massacres. Shame!",0
I love how he delivers his lines. I don't recommend movie. I got much less. I liked'Running Time '. I enjoy B movies.,0
"I gave the movie an extra star for letting see the extra hot female in the almost nude. lets take the series back to its roots. this is where the future movies need to draw inspiration from. I'm sorry to say that this movies was one of the biggest disappointments of the year. because to be honest, seeing a waitress killed by the ALIEN we all have feared since childhood just really doesn't do it for us. Following one of the biggest disappointments in movie monster match up history you would think that they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation.",0
"AVPR is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative elucidation i. Step in Paul W. S Anderson, Alien Vs Predator, and now the Brothers Strauss ( visual effects graduates, not even directors or writers ).",0
Why is the Predator alone? ( not convincing & absolutely superfluous for the plot ). < br / > < br / > At last the action of the movie is really poor. As one can see immediately the whole story is a mess.,0
It doesn't have to. The movie is as predictable as the sunrise.,0
"We didn't know any of them, we all know what happens when the lil aliens make their corporeal exit, we all know the blood is acid. Spielberg has tried and failed at this several times, usually with Tom Cruise. < br / > < br / > What was the budget on this movie? Who cares who gets killed? Sure movies make money but should they? It isn't worth a 3. Even if you are a die hard Alien / Pred fan like I am wait for the DVD. No ooohs, or "" that was bad ass! No you shouldn't. "", nothing.",0
"It's awful. What's that guy supposed to be? Never. I really, really don't understand how that movie could get a rating bigger than 4 here on IMDb.",0
< br / > < br / > Aliens and Predator are AWESOME. This movie made a big joke out of them.,0
"It was not well received by any means. Come on now, people. Fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money. Thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line - that was more difficult. Leaving out important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. They may be monkeys but they clearly knew CGI would play a key role in the film. Putting red and green filters over the camera lens provided some excellent Predator visions. They hired fifteen TV actors shortly after.",0
And the younger is most likely looking for the kind parent that she ( or he ) lacked as a child. Her spirited performance wrung from me a better rating than this film would otherwise deserve.,0
"A ridiculous comedy given an arms - flailing direction. Reynolds is pallid. I love one of the comments here : "" Couldn't be made today "".",0
"But don't go questioning the sense of humor or fan loyalty of those who aren't having multiple orgasms over Campbell's latest cinematic coupe. I'm sorry, but this is one of THE WORST movies I've ever seen! Believe me, we all went into this really wanting to like it, but left feeling incredibly disappointed and robbed of two hours.",0
The term jailbait comes immediately to mind. The premise is absolutely laughable. < br / > < br / > But it's not enough. < br / > < br / > Susan Slept Here got one Oscar nomination. It's a pity he didn't go out with his performance in The Bad and the Beautiful. So they give her to Dick Powell at Christmas time. Of course he directed some more films and appeared frequently on television until he died.,0
"As it is, Radiant is a snoozefest. A relief yes, but not dramatic in the slightest. And it's the most boring narration ever. But it's plain and simply not. It's no surprise that half of audience walked out of this, I was not one of them for some reason.",0
"This disconnection and repetition is reflected in the annoying and distracting commentary. However these faded through the movie. I hoped it was just the introduction to the story. Yet the introduction hadn't gone well. However it did start to worry me as it continued, combined with another overly husky Max Payne type voice over the movie was starting to look not so good. It began reciting words one after the other. < br / > < br / > The story is what really caught me and took me to this movie.",0
"Overall, very tedious.",0
"Knowing who directed it,'The Hep Cat'is bitter disappointment. We all have off days and this was clearly one of Clampett's!",0
"Just watched this today on TCM, where the other reviewers here saw it. Of course this bio also includes commentary by fans ( make of that what you will ). < br / > < br / > Davies was a very attractive young woman, and by all accounts a terrific comedienne in real life.",0
"Sleeping with the man who finances your films is bound to get noticed. In fact, MARIANNE would now rank as the fifth best movie ever according to IMDb with a score of 8. However, she was a much better actress than CITIZEN KANE implied and initially broke into films before she began sleeping with Hearst. While this isn't one of Miss Davies'very worst films, it is pretty bad. 8!!! This certainly is the image created in Orson Welles'CITIZEN KANE. It is true that Hearst did use his considerable wealth and clout to build Davies'career.",0
"Still, there are a lot of other needy holidays. This is no exception, with some scenes that tend to go on too long. But basically a pretty silly movie. He'd had one shoe stolen, and unable to replace it, he was dubbed "" Oneshoe McGroo.

Suddenly, the sixth trail member, Dimitri, is punctured with several arrowheads from the Mayans and all hell breaks loose. < br / > < br / > Now, if there was ever a plot to this movie, it ended here.

"To top it off, the female lead character continues to annoy you off with her stupidity. < br / > < br / > Overall this is a poorly done movie. In summary, if you have a lot of time to kill, go watch it Such roles should be reserved for secondary characters. Characters were undeveloped, the monsters ( plants in this case ) left unexplained, and clichés were dripping all over. When I saw 6.",0
"With the title ruins you would think that out of 3000 years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit. I have to say that this movie was not what i expected. As for this movie it will hit the'b'list in no time. The thing had a better story line than this did. come on, is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd?. But plants?....",0
"Turn it off and go to bed! "" Bruce, I'm really disappointed.",0
"The Ruins "" spawns nothing in the way of either thrills or chills. What was Stiller thinking when he sank his bucks into this chiller about cursed carnivorous undergrowth that creeps up on its victims and devours them. A couple of other movies that served either intentionally or unintentionally come to mind, too. A malicious mastiff that suddenly lurches on - camera to snarl at our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill.",0
"From start to finish, I could not help to hate this movie. Where do I begin? God!",0
I didn't know a lot about it so I wasn't sure if it was going to be worth it. I saw this movie with very low expectations.,0

Why? It's worth to note that their characters and acting would be fine if this wasn't a 70 something - part series and if they didn't get that much screen time.,0
"With shows like this ( and the incomparable "" The Office "" ), NBC is obviously on to something. < br / > < br / >'Earl'takes an unusual approach. Thankfully, it landed in the right hands. Did they finally free a cubicle or two for quality assurance? It's not about the "" daily musings of an eccentric family "" ( zzzz.. ) nor about the other boring stuff you see everywhere in sitcoms. Let's hope so.",0
"It has been proved before many other shows. I agree with the comments regarding the downward spin. We can handle more heady content. The last view shows have been a little better, but surely the writers need some more direction.",0

The only reason I rented this movie was that Val Kilmer rarely stars in a bad movie. There is of course a first time for everything. American actors in Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda did help.,0
Val Kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes. There is just something that tells you not to look... but you do. He takes him to the nearest town to collect the bounty. Nevertheless this western is like watching a train wreck.,0

A waste of time. Very little dialog.,0

I saw this film while I was in France and I must say that it confused me. ).,0
< br / > < br / > I was also very disappointed with Patricia Kaas. It still screwed up the flow of the movie somehow. Lovable rogue didn't suit his strengths. At least for me. Irons is a talented actor but he was wrong for this part. And he would have brought the screen magic in spades. Nothing she sang moved me. Otherwise it is just hollow.,0
"There was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all. Now that I think about it, Golf isn't that bad....... I'd recommend Armageddon over this piece of crap any day.",0
Well... It really is a pity bevcause Kaas really shines in this film. I like Patricia Kaas.,0
I don't see what is the whole deal about this movie.,0
"Irons plays yet another moneyed charmer who's had a touch of the sun. The whole exercise comes across like an interminably long Ralph Lauren ad. Kaas is a pleasing singer but not much of an actress. The pace stumbles on like a legionnaire stranded in the Sahara. Luckily, the script does not often call on her to emote away from the jazz club microphone.",0

"How about if I told you the ringleader was a shadow puppet. No? It's too bad, this movie could have used a sense of humor. OK. Don't even get me started on Stephen Lang. Everyone involved should feel ashamed. Would you be surprised if I told you this movie deals with a conspiracy? Makes you wonder if this movie even had a glimmer of hope.",0
Linda Hamilton gives a poor performance. Rarely have I seen an action / suspense movie that was so boring.,0
The acting isn't that great and the action scenes are soooo cheesy it's not even funny. I still wonder why I sat through this entire thing.,0
"Yes, very resistant suit that sheen wears.",0
They could have achieved so much more in general. Worse still was her predictable final scene with Bishop. This was barely worth £1 it cost me. This all looked quite promising.,0
"My Take : Routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists. After a professor is murdered, Sheen aids the help of ex - flame reporter Amanda Givens ( Linda Hamilton ) to uncover the traitor and unlock the conspiracy of the title. Some considerable talents ( Donald Sutherland, Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang ) try their best on a routine script, but rarely saves it from predictability of the script. < br / > < br / > Rating : * * out of 5. < br / > < br / > But this script, written by Adi Hasak & Ric Gibbs, are pedestrian as they come, not much differing from other White House conspiracy thrillers as in ABSOLUTE POWER and MURDER AT 1600.",0
So what is it? I think Okul is one of them.,0
"Anyway, I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 just because of its comic value.",0
Brainless yet action - packed meaningless trife despite loads and loads of acting talent ( all pretty much wasted. ),0

"The scene continues with avon continuing to say "" alllrriiiight! "" The end. ( except for avon. ) This man is never in the movie. Wheeee. The plot, oh wait, there is no plot.

Storyline drags.,0

"I call this coffee table cinema. A long lost relative comes to visit, he's a midget and well, that's as far as I got. I mean..",0
A definite skip.,0
"Can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue, flicking your ears, and punching your chest and head? Finally, there is other end of the absurd Keith Carradine. The others following her performance were needed, but not stellar. Take for example Rod Steiger's vision of some old, wild spoken preacher. Redgrave gave Amelia this soulful drawl that was a blend of her own unique voice and a hard - earned woman from the south. "" To the average viewer, this could be construed as annoying, but as the film progressed it became her Miss Amelia transforming this stage beauty into a roughneck. The image was needed to set the scene, but the characters of the town had no other purpose.",0
"Watch this film and find out. Unlikable characters, one after the other. Well, maybe that's the book, too, and I am being unfair to this film. How insulting is that?

"This review actually applies to 2 films paired on a single DVD. However, the script is not adapted from any actual Doyle story. In any event, these films are considerably less estimable. Some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produce by Hammer Studios. The plot is melodramatic and banal. 66 or more.",0

"It reminds me of a scene in "" Scary Movie "" where Carmen Electra flees from the killer.

"FIVE TIMES. Whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you. I think even God would say, "" Good call.

Its just boring. 0?,0
Originally titled Metal God this movie could have been something great. 2 ) There is NOTHING metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston.,0
I found'Shuttle'an incredibly frustrating film to watch. And annoying. After that it becomes very lazy and underwritten as a story.,0
The end result is they get a flat tire. One of the men is killed trying to escape - - even that lacks any suspense. On the shuttle with them is a rather milquetoast looking business type. < br / It's at this point that the driver reveals himself to be a kidnapper and he has taken all the people hostage. < br / > < br / > There are a couple of attempts to escape by the women. Milquetoast is beaten over the head with tire iron - - yet he survives. One of the women is killed.,0

This was intolerable.,0
This is a terrible film.,0

"Say it to stupid young boys. Artistically this film was zero. Stupid characters and idiotic dialogs. Just sleep. Real 90s. Then you have a bit time to have fun. Yeah, what a moral.",0
The direction is terrible and the acting is worse. ! I don't know why this has gotten any decent reviews as it could be the weakest horror comedy I've ever seen.,0
"Even if "" Evil Dead "" or "" Dead Alive "" had subsequent amounts of gore cut out, they'd still be entertaining. "" The movie goes nowhere, following him around on psychiatric sessions and scuffles with classmates. Just like that. Jack Brooks "" isn't. It is a good fifteen minutes. It's plain boring, which is the worst thing a film of this nature can be.",0
The so called monsters are just hideously bad!,0
< br / > < br / > Not so.,0
As for the narration and many of the flashbacks : needless. And then it's over.,0
"and for the last 15 minutes, that's exactly what viewers get : non - stop splattery effects ; a silly, tentacled Jabba - style demon thingy ; and mucho macho monster mashing!",0
"robert englund is pretty pathetic in this along with everyone else. shoulda watched uh hellraiser 3 if I wanted to see an 8 pack! strange, why don't I just rent a porno or something?",0
"Jack Brooks ( Trevor Matthews ) is a college student with some severe anger issues. In fact, 0 % of the film was CGI.",0
"I've seen many horror, splatter, monster movies in my life.",0
From the point of budget 2. The only really BIG star in this is David Scott who's artwork for the monsters is fab!,0
It barely qualifies as a TV movie. Everything is half done. No emotion.,0
Avoid. My guess is that it appeals to the same people who like'Withnail and I '. And I thought it was self - indulgent even * before * Dylan Moran became the writer.,0
"Hey, they are like you and me. Why a bookstore? If a situation threatens to arise, it is quickly shooed away. It might be a mere Generation Thing, and yet the differences can be pointed out.

< br / > < br / > So not the best one...,0
"We start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film. Think of this film as fan service, a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer. Oh well.. 4 / Hmm... potential future suspect maybe? Rinse, then repeat.",0
All the cliché's of a slasher film without any substance. Throughout the movie you will see this. Obviously everyone wants Mandy Lane and she apparently wants none of the guys. Sounds decent so far right? This movie is beyond useless.,0
"What a disappointment! It starts out well enough. the opening scene was actually pretty tense, but from there it's all downhill.",0
"Please! ) Oh, boo - hoo ), the boys soon enough illustrate they'd settle for sex with any random bimbo and not exclusively with the "" divine "" Mandy and the final twist albeit undeniably offbeat is just plain senseless. The middle section of is rather boring and doesn't even offer any genuinely horrific excitement ( shotgun killings? My generous rating 4 out of 10 entirely goes to the grainy and unsettling 70'filming style ( with faded colors, bizarre but beautiful photographic images ) and the surprisingly marvelous soundtrack. Supposedly this was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror film in years, with non - stereotypical teen characters and unpredictable plot twists for a change.",0
"Yep, you guessed it. Mandy remains a virgin, and there's still no sex. But, nothing seems to become of it, and this viewer wonders why? Nobody, including the audience, seems to give a damn. And, there is absolutely no sex. Mandy accepts an invitation, from her student friends, to go to a secluded ranch.",0
0 rating? The director has a certain visual flair. No doubt about that.,0
"In nine out of ten, you can see the next scene coming 5 minutes before it starts.",0
Here is another great film critics will love. The very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant. They simply don't mesh with each other. < br / > < br / > The films premise is simple. Where did they get the dresses and wigs?,0
( Stars 3 out of 10 ) I saw the IMDb rating and 6. After usual interesting opening the movie takes a downward turn with every unfolding of event. Thus went to see it. NO. Amber Heard acts and plays her role well as a shy and conscious girl who is aware of her beauty and men's desire for her. All this for suspense?,0
Both have their problems. Weird.,0
"< br / > < br / > The music is just too sick to listen to. And to make it worst, I was scare of this game when I was a kid. One minute it's a action game and then it's a shooter.",0
"Also, John C likely has the least awful character in the film. I mean, yah i guess i enjoyed parts of it. ( His career is dead, hence the late. Again, a proved plot. < br / > < br / > I keep thinking up ways to make this movie better.",0
Did this have anything to say? Why did they even make a movie like this? Then I noticed that this was going to be a road - movie and I decided to actually watch this. There are many of those.,0
This movie was an all around uninspiring film.,0
So overall Unforgiven is not Eastwoods best and by far one of the worst westerns around. The acting doesn't seem to flow and contribute to what characters are feeling. Unforgiven is Clint Eastwoods last tribute to the once great west. The direction is poorly misled by quirky shots.,0
"He is no Burt Lancaster, no Paul Newman, no John Wayne. Then there's the anti - Western Western plot. Still, I didn't like it. He is not and never has been a leading man. Here he plays a retired tough guy. Finally there is the pacing of Eastwood's direction. It was way too slow.",0
Alas... Instead we get characters like Riff Raff ( a WOLF!! ) What next? ( My advanced apologies if Disney jumps on! ),0
"< br / > < br / > As a stand alone movie, it is awful. They should have drugged me to see it. < br / > < br / > My wife and son drug me to see this. It is not an homage.",0
"Especially because it's meant to be funny and I guess heart - warming in some weird way. The idea of nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip sounds pretty good for a movie. Plus, believe it or not, there is a scene where four of the guys are out raping sheep! < br / > < br / > All in all, I really hated this movie.",0
The jokes were also terrible. I beg you to avoid at all costs. Everything about the movie was cringe worthy. I wasn't expecting much but it exceeded my expectations of being awful.,0
"Underdog to put it blunt is horrendous, it really is. < br / > < br / > So lets get onto the acting ( cracks knuckles ). I remember seeing the very first trailer for Underdog back last March, I also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly. What's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel! Then we get onto the human actors, and well the majority of atrocious. Little did I know for what I was about to endure.",0
He acted the part shockingly well. Silence. Her presence was extremely unnecessary.,0
That's how predictable this movie is. < br / > < br / > How do I begin? That was slightly funny.,0
"As for quality entertainment, this one is strictly for the juniors. Here is the story of Shoeshine, a regular, playful little beagle.",0
The acting was passable but needed a little improvement. 3. I didn't like Underdog!,0
"Story of the creation of Underdog and adventures battling Simon Bar Sinister in a live action format. For me the film half works and half doesn't. On the street Shoeshine runs afoul of Riff Raff, another dog and gets picked up by Jim Belushi who was a guard at the lab.",0
"It's a steaming pile of dog droppings. When Underdog the cartoon debuted in 1964, at the age of 7 I was hooked immediately.",0
"First of all, there was nothing humorous in the least bit. What I got going in with that expectation was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, bar none. Parents, spend your money on Up, Wall - E, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Water Horse or Hotel for Dogs for the best, recent family / kids flicks, or even Alvin and the Chipmunks is better than this filth!",0
Avoid 9 Souls like plague. I personally found it senseless and tasteless. Critics love this movie.,0
But no. A stereotyped dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister. Watch this only in desperation. Poor scripting. And some pet owners who add nothing to the story.,0
"I had a blast. When I first became a father about 5. This, in my humble opinion, is cruel and unusual punishment. Bow. < br / > < br / > Underdog is bad. Wow.",0
"Boring, illogical, terrible. Don't make more movies!",0
The final 10 minutes ( maybe a bit more ) of Rise of the Undead features no dialogue whatsoever & the film just suddenly ends. Why is the building they are in still standing? ).,0
How did this ever get a DVD release? I swear i've seen better films from my film I class at school.,0
Or not.,0
"This is NOT a zombie movie. < br / > < br / > I will say this for the film : the zombies were creepy. ( And no, yelling does not equate with emoting ). All of the actors seem to have studied at the Buster Keaton School of Wooden Faces. Would it have killed them to show some emotion? Moreover, the acting is not laughably bad so much as non - existent. Do not be misled.",0
You've been warned ; ) It's just so - bad and that's it. My advice : save your money.,0
"And the later Hellraiser movies? Absolutely god - awful. "" < br / > < br / > This movie is terrible. And you've seen Jacob's Ladder, right? The dialogue is never interesting. I DON'T KNOW. """,0
"3 "" rating it had when I got here. No suspense.",0
He gave us both the most over - rated film in history ( The Deer Hunter ) and the worst film in history ( Heaven's Gate ). You have to acknowledge Cimino's contribution to cinema. 99 DVD of the long version. The citizens of the county then besieged the regulators who finally were arrested ( or rescued ) by the Army. And before you start with the'It's bad but not the worst ever'let me explain.,0
"But sure enough, Combs was present. Otherwise, I cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon. Maybe a remake is in order if that wouldn't be too disrespectful.",0
Randall and Fischer? The end result?,0
"Can't get enough. < br / > < br / > Finally zombies are in the mix, but no one watching cares any more. Zombie movies are hot, I love'em. All of this is littered with non - acting and bad dialogue. Me too guys, me too.",0
"It's lost on me, definitely a walk out movie.",0
It was so very terrible.,0
It stank. This movie was total cheese.,0
"Ugh. < br / > < br / > And The bonfire of the sanities? So tell the jury that! "" The questioning itself is sexually creepy, a relentlessy repeated assault in its own way. The court investigators and "" therapists "" repeat the pattern.",0
"He is the Harrison Ford of TV. < br / > < br / > Elsewhere in the viewer comments on this site, one very astute observer complained about the variety of diabolically bad accents in this film. NOT TO MENTION A BETTER CINEMATOGRAPHER. I have never seen a smile on Mr. CSI! Just every now and then, he could just possibly pass for British or a very British sounding South African played obviously by an American actor.",0
Nothing wrong with that until it's revealed her character is from Philidelphia in the United States! It's interesting to note that this site hasn't given this movie country of origin. I was lost This what struck me about this thriller while watching it - The way accents don't match their characters.,0
Little more than fodder for the bored couch potato.,0
Miscasting at its worst. The Harvard scene is useless and not needed. I watched this last nite with an open mind. Walken's makeup is strange. The accents are bad especially Richard Masur.,0
"But if you're into poop, fart and boner jokes, you'll be in seventh heaven. It was so bad it inspired me to write my first review. The shock factor is set to 10. The characters overact.",0
They should have just stuck to making a straight out comedy filled with no realism.,0
or maybe this movie just isn't funny. this movie is allegedly a comedy. I don't see it. so where did all the laughs go. so what is the point?,0
"This movie isn't even a half a star. Sinbad, couldn't act if he tried. If we could give a negative number, minus 9. A complete waste of time and of film.",0
"this movie should be banned and burned. pretty much, no one should watch this movie. this movie sucks. i'd rate the movie an F -.",0
Judging by some of the other comments even that did not succeed that well.,0
Strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene. Neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line.,0
"She struggles with telling her fiancé, John. Melinda Hamilton stars as Amy, a girl who has had oral sex with a canine in the past on a lark. The film deals with the fallout of said escapade. And the film while solid enough seems to miss it'mark a few times.",0
Not a bad concept. But besides this there's not much to this movie.,0
"This film is totally unbelievable. What's more it never had any detrimental affect on her ever again except when she tells someone. Yet the'heroine'is portrayed as a hard done by, nice girl who had one moment of aberration. If she had she would have stopped in her tracks. Child abuse? This is NO WAY a one off happening in an otherwise perfect life. Human beings have instinctive boundaries for reasons. If we are now to start considering bestiality as a'cute'little aberration, what is next?",0
"I can't warn you enough off this movie. Oh and by the way the Johnson County war was not a war, it never happened. I believe that when someone tells you to watch it, they are, in fact, trying to bore you to death. Though this isn't a reason to hate it, it is historically way off. I have just recently seen Heaven's Gate.",0
"Maybe I missed something, I don't know. This movie brings a low to original ideas. DISGUSTING thats all I have to say anymore!",0
"Inuyasha "" was awful. I find "" Inuyasha "" incredibly boring and dumb.",0
Rumiko Takahashi has done a LOT better then this. Tch. Shame they were killed off. So this series actually does have some likable characters. He has ADORABLE DOG EARS!,0
"< br / > < br / > My final criticism of this anime is the animation. From the start, its premise dooms it to be stereotypical. Sadly, no one rescues the story of Inuyasha.",0
We thought Inuyasha was 16 +! Why? Sexual harassment is NOT funny. Especially the Mask game. They all sucked. The videogames. May or may not contain spoilers.,0
"Inuyasha, it seems, can also be described this way. It has many great episodes, but in between them are countless filler episodes.",0
"In fact, when i first started to watch it, I quickly became hooked. Many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it. Characters gasp in horror. I do NOT hate this show. You can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know. I actually quite like some aspects of it. Enemy turns out to have barrier. < br / > < br / > Allow me to explain the plot for you. Windscar deflects. The only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull ( the band of seven ). Let me state this right from the start.",0
Plot holes were left open. And Inu - Yasha was funny and hot - headed. The animation got worse and worse as the series progressed. Nothing happened. And I really liked it then. Oh man!,0
"Will there be please coming an end to hyping movies that are dealing about social conflicts or other human disasters? Care "" should have been much much better.",0
"It had almost all the ingredients... but the "" chef "" was awful... The film is nothing else than an exposition of nudity. Going back to the movie...",0
"In the end, she was accused of rustling - an act almost certainly untrue. But the film took great license - as usual with Hollywood. Those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial. James Averill ( Chris Christopherson ), and "" Elle "" were actually married in real life. They chose homesites on Crazy Woman Creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them out repeatedly, which they refused. By filing as single individuals, they could get two homesteads. Their main contribution to the Johnson County war, was to start it by being hanged.",0
"He was witty, he spared no one in his critics and must now be rolling in his tomb. It's treated like cheap, throwaway trash. Remember how every movie in the 80's, no matter the genre or the tone always found way to sneak in some nudity? As you might not know Eça de Queiroz is one of Portugal's most rightfully celebrated writers. Ahem, gratuitous is the word I think.",0
"Maybe Carlos Coelho da Silva should see the 2002 Carlos Carrera adaptation of the same book of Eça and get the felling of how to build a true movie. The problem overall in this "" trying to be "" film is that as no taste, or very, very bad taste.",0
"I saw this film yesterday on TV. Two wasted hours! Eça de Queirós surely did not deserve this. And, of course, the name of some characters. João Eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons.",0
"The narrator said the animal dies instantaneous, it didn't. I turned this off within the first five minutes.",0
life to short to watch this movie.,0
"McLaren claims that he created the band ( and even the genre of punk rock ) as a scam to make money. Seeing it a third time, nearly three years after the second, I didn't care much for it at all.",0
The Sid Vicious scenes are few and idiotic. The punk rock zeitgeist right there.,0

He was not sacked. < br / > < br / > * McLaren boasts about the money he made from the band. < br / > < br / > * McLaren did not instigate the Bill Grundy incident. The Pistols only appeared on the programme because Queen had pulled out. < br / > < br / > Here are some real facts. Rotten and Vicious went back a long way too. Jones and Cook were childhood friends. Some of the evidence used by Lydon's lawyers was from McLaren's boasting in'The Great Rock & Roll Swindle '.,0
"There's also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots. Seriously - 2 / 10. In the end, I couldn't even watch this in one sitting.",0
I can't tell you how much I'm sorry I saw this horrifying ghastly movie. < br / > < br / > Take care.,0
there is only way to describe this movie. < br / > < br / > the acting is so bad i laughed my ass off throughout. < br / > < br / > so bad its hilarious.,0
"Romania is 88 % Orthodox but you'd never know that from this movie : Father Soren is Irish. The first reviewer said the producers had done their research. Well, if that's true they messed up on the religious aspect of film.",0
I'd choose Girls Gone Wild. This movie is like porn with all of the good parts removed.,0
"To rule it? In pursuit of one of the kidnappers Griffin loses him on the roof of a building but finds a large pool of blood & no visible signs of what happened to him. The script by Wynorski, Ion Ionescu, A. G. Lawrence & Bill Munroe is crap, is unexciting, dull & is as simplistic as you can get. How did the priest know it was there? For a start I would like to know if there was only one Gargoyle left who laid all those eggs because I'm pretty sure it couldn't have made itself pregnant. What did it eat?",0
I gave 3 out of 10 stars. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. That's a great metaphor for this movie. The best acting is done by the CG Gargoyles.,0
"< br / > < br / > Overall, not recommended. Makes me wish they still did new episodes MST3K.",0
"Every film junkie should work with a B - movie staple at least once before death. No American - style guardrails or warning signs for Bucarest. < It gets dirty under there and you've gotta clean it sometime. It is at least not pretentious. Literally the loveliest. I don't think I'm spoiling anyone's experience of this film by telling you not to see it if you have anything better to do, like clean under the stove. < br / > < br / > I think the movie suffers from a lack of sex and violence, though there is one car chase stunt that looks so dangerous it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer. """,0
"Rusty pliers, at that. The plot follows the cleverest girl in school, played by Katie Holmes. < br / > < br / > The plot is very similar to 1997 flick'Suicide Kings ', and a whole host of earlier films.",0
I give this a 4 ( four ).,0
I doubt any women took part in the siege. < br / > < br / > The worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers. Ella was never a prostitute. A lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing.,0

It's like Kathleen Turner in ` Serial Mom '! Watching Kevin Williamson films means torturing!,0
"It seemed to get caught in playing both a black comedy and straight - out thriller, without making it gel. < br / > < br / > Wasn't fan of it when I first saw it, and after another viewing, I'm still not one. So before she reports it the next morning. The film's ending takes the cake.",0
"You wanted me to fail. Blah blah blah. "" Sorry for any spoilers that this contains. So then we get to Teaching Mrs. Tingle. Great.",0
It almost succeeds as science fiction. 0.,0
"As I indicated, the end result left me underwhelmed. He's more mysterious, he's more athletic, and he's more exotic. If I have to say something positive I would point to the performance of Keye Luke. Mr. Moto is not Chan. But even he's not near enough to save Mr. Moto's Gamble in my eyes.",0
"They let him all alone... and everything went wrong. Three words - - director Michael Cimino. It was truly staggering how BAD the film was! < br / > < br / > First off, the sound is horrible. A definite must - miss. This is from a guy who made "" Tron ""! The dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible!",0
"But that is it. < br / > < br / > The film starts with some laughs, which run well throughout. A terrible screen presence and bitterly annoying. The visuals are quite nice and work well with the sights of Paris. Determined to thank him, she begins to help him fix his own life. That's all the film has got going for it.",0
"4 / 10 < br / > < br / > This film is no "" Wings of Desire "" or "" Wonderful Life "". Angel - A is a change of pace for Besson ; monochrome, mawkish and rather mediocre.",0
This is a really obnoxious show. Now it'one big trash machine.,0
That is not correct! A question only asked by them who haven't seen this terrible nonsense movie.,0
But maybe I'm missing something ; until then it'still not worth more than a 3 in my opinion.,0
"As a two hour feature, it's pretentious, boring, stupid and plain out silly. < br / > < br / > The rest of the cast is, however, bad. Some scenes are plain ridiculous - especially the end scenes. < br / > < br / > I give this film 3 / 10. What kind of movie about a ship that sinks is that? Also, the main lead, Jürgen Prochnov, is at times very good.",0
"This could have been much more! This is not a good movie. The acting... well, what acting?",0
The three top - level bad guys were camp.,0
"Although the choreography of the fight is bad, the whole scene is undeniably memorable. ).",0
"Director ( and writer, ha ha ) Erwin C. Dietrich delights in showing close - ups of the naked female body, but it's never very erotic. Overall, this might suffice for people that are really into this sort of stuff ; but I can't say I enjoyed it. I've come to realise through watching this sort of film that I don't like them very much.",0
"This is the movie that, pretty much, sounded the death knell for the auteur in Hollywood. Even on that level, it's impossible to enjoy the movie. He didn't. It's just bad sound recording.",0
"Another example of the women - in - prison genre. That said, there are at least some minimal production values.",0
"girl by soldiers. The girls are ravishing, though, and the Ibiza filming location looks very enchanting. I'd love to write a little summary of this movie's plot, but... there simply isn't one!",0
How?,0
It would be good if he wasn't so typecast all the time. Bank heist / Cop thriller sounds OK right?,0
"How could a film so bad be made? Police officers don't carry or use radios. The film "" Chaos "" takes its name from Gleick's 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory. Let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film. Nothing.",0
In other words - the creators planed to make comedy not drama.,0
"Dekker : No. It's just something I picked up along way. Obvious tailored vehicle for Ryan Philippe. However, there wasn't much for Snipes and Statham to chew on.",0
- What's with the safety deposit box. < br / > < br / > First of all - the opening scene. Then the things that happen in the bank are strange and pointless. But it's boring and mundane.,0
What annoyed me most? It's pointless. The battle scenes are tedious and dizzying. His death scene could very well be the stupidest in history. This movie is really bad.,0
"i'd compare this movie with "" The Inside Man "" { the same loss of time }. i'm tired of copy and paste movies. many people - many tastes. HOWEVER FOR ME "" CHAOS "" ISASTELESS! those people, who told me "" this movie is good "" - shame on them!",0
< br / > < br / > Not recommended. Frankly I'm amazed to see that this movie is getting relatively good reviews.,0
This is the award that made me lose all respects for the Hugos. The answer : not much.,0

"< br / > < br / > And the stolen ideas from Jane Campion's The Piano are too obvious to overlook. It could have easily been a radio play although even then it would be hard to follow the story. Apart from the beautiful imagery thanks to New Zealand cinematographer Alun Bollinger, this film is not worth seeing. Does it remind you of when Wiremu has his'trigger finger'amputated, and surprisingly too with an axe? On top of that, the repetitive samples used over and over again leave the audience on the verge of laughter. I thought so.",0
"Mumbling voices was the end result, and the cinematography was average to fair at best. I have the umost appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film, sadly I did not enjoy this one.",0
absolute rubish. I cant believe how bad it was. < br / > < br / > I give this movie a 2 out of 10. WOW. WTF is his character doing there?,0
It is the difference between say John Ford and Sam Wood. All of the extras do this. This is mise - en - scene. In the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multi - dimensional. Maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a terrible film.,0
New Zealand looks awesome. Everything else just plain sucks. People fighting doesn't make any sense. This is by far one the most boring movies I've ever seen!,0
THIS MOVIE FAILS! 3. If Kiefer dies in a movie..... it fails. WHAT!?,0
Unfortunately this was very hard to do with Samantha Morton. Beautiful scenery and the acting of Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis was about the only plus. < br / > < br / > Maybe by being a kiwi I set the bar higher for locally made films.,0
"In my opinion, it didn't succeed in either. The scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. We watched about an hour of it and turned it off.",0
But the story is sabotaged by the director's overriding infatuation with his own cleverness twinned with a very poor script. < br / > < br / > Too bad.,0
"The one thing that I would add is the disjointed way the movie has been Directed and Produced. Reading through most of the other reviews, I tend to agree with most of the comments. Worth watching, but not many would come back for a second view. This is a story with real potential, spoilt by trying to be different in it's production.",0
Sutherland is a total waste.,0
"< br / > < br / > However, these are minor gripes compared to the motivation and actions of Sarah. Films don't have to be believable, but films like this, with a political edge and social commentary do. This is absolutely the case with Sutherland, who is frankly rubbish as Doyle.",0
"Inexplicably, two Harvard grads ( Hurt and Kris Kristofferson ) are in Wyoming. His entire character made no sense. < br / > < br / > The next scene is 20 years later. I watched the 219 minute version and have to say that dollar - for - dollar, it it probably one of the worst films ever.",0
"The story has some old horror actor legend dying. Is the movie over already? He commits murders and dies, but what is this?",0
E. g. How on earth did Wiremu know how to find Sarah and Doyle? Keifer's Irish brogue needs a little polishing. < br / > < br / > I did go to this movie with an open mind. No explanation and very unsatisfying. I hadn't read or heard anything much apart from its troubled production.,0
"plus, i thought the acting left a lot to be desired. i didn't care for it too much. kids will likely enjoy it.",0
It is a must see.,0
"We are merely watching an arranged form of pictures, ranging from a one arm man beating a horse, to a toothless soldier in the war. Everything in between is awkward, haphazard and quite unnecessary. The film itself is only a compilation of scenes which have no inherent meaning to someone living outside of Russia.",0
This makes the movie easier to follow and gives a few interesting insights. Gimme a break!,0
"If you've got to remember, these are fine memories. She reminds me of Béatrice Dalle and Gina Gershon. My guess is I wouldn't.",0
mediocre acting and a rather boring plot.,0
Take my advice and DO NOT RENT THIS GAME. A majour dissapointing sequel to GoldenEye.,0
Man this thing bites! He killed people! It'sick and perverse! I say Friedkin can forget it!,0
"Rampage "" is unfortunately more like the latter. From the brilliant mind that brought us "" The Exorcist ""... and "" Cruising. "" Sometimes you just have to choose, "" says the lead character. """,0
"You will see just how aimless and lost this film truly is. The "" issues "" it may have been trying to deal with are lost in a miasma. < br / > < br / > Heaven's Gate is a bad movie, it is fundamentally awful.",0
"It's just shocking how wrinkled and awful she looks. She shows a little too much flesh in this movie, something Davis and Crawford would never have done. < br / > < br / > Gale Sondergard is old, old, old. ! Perhaps she thought she was making a movie that would be as successful as one of the Bette Davis horrors. If it's not one of Stooges, it's somebody. There are some descriptions of the plot already here, so I won't go into it. The old gal Hopkins never stopped working, so you have to hand it to her.",0
"The script is all over the place & it can't really decide what it wants to be, Savage Intruder suffers from an identity crisis! Katharine has recently broken her foot & needs a personal assistant & gives Vic job. Vic starts to turn Katharine against the other employees, but Vic isn't what he seems.",0
"that Welles said was that he's been in decline his whole career. Unfortunately, Welles seemed completely incapable of telling it. < br / > < br / > There was an interesting story here.",0
"Clifford Irving is a biographer who wrote the allegedly fraudulent Howard Hughes autobiography, yet, at least it seems, purports his innocence. This is one documentary that I would say to at least give a shot, but don't be afraid to turn it off if you're not enjoying it. They created a distraction as opposed to lending style. If the story had been more clear and comprehensive, I think that editing probably would not have been as annoying.",0
Even the bad language sounded tired.,0
She's hot and their romance is believable on many levels. This movie is the polar opposite.,0
Monotonous murky drama with an endless drone of background music.,0
"This may be director Jim Wynorski's backyard. No such luck. The one "" natural "" gal here is humiliated by the director. < br / > < br / > This is just bad stuff.",0
No you go! This goes on and on and on forever. There is nothing in this video that actually qualifies as a sex scene.,0
"! But where's the sex? Sure, we get a few quick flashes and a couple of "" bathing in the creek "" scenes. This movie has real promise : porn stars in a skinemax feature!",0
"They might have been serious and then we're doomed. Why does the hero look so faggy? The whole film. "". < br / > < br / > The film's end really tops it.",0
But know what?,0
"Oh yeah, it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. Since when does that count as film? < br / > < br / > Of course, Alex does eventually get her audition at the Conservatory. Not a line of work most older women find their way into, much less 18 - year - olds fresh out of high school. Inexplicably, when her boss / boyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she's throws one her tantrums.",0
No seriously it was. This movie was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea to sell some records.,0
I found Alex extremely repellent. Who was supposed to be dancing? This is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup. Yuck. And what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. How sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. She also has the temper tantrums of a toddler.,0
The whole thing was quite pathetic.,0
I just watched it on TV & my friend and I were amazed at how dopey it was. A genuine guilty pleasure. How could it fail? People say it's dated but Flashdance was always rubbish.,0
< br / > < br / > The dancing horrible. Steel work is dangerous. What the hell are they doing in there? She was obviously board and just started cutting random things up. Please.,0

I think vampire movies ( usually ) are wicked. But this stinks. I bought it for £1.,0
The acting is terrible. Do not rent this movie. I registered with IMDb. smash it with hammer.,0
"Perhaps she made the "" wrong "" choice. The moving scenes totally fell flat. In short : the timing is WAY off. I'm sorry but the acting is horrible. Beyond horrible.",0
This movie makes me want to cry. Never rent this. 99 at blockbuster.,0
"Horrible acting, amateur direction, weak dialog. < br / > < br / > I watched it last, made myself comfy, and waited.",0
"Just the way the scenes were edited and the acting, it made me cringe at some points. This is so sending a wrong and unrealistic message. I gave it 3 stars and everything considered I think that was very kind of me. Only watch this film if you want to laugh at how bad is.",0
"The acting... well, I don't even know what to say. It was pretty hard though.",0
"But it doesn't, it focuses of pain, on loss and leaves the message at just theoretical ideal.",0
Yawn.,0
"Well Mr. Programmer, after watching this film I must answer back "" No we don't, and either do you! "" Yes, I almost fell asleep more than once. < br / > < br / > But overall expect to see Jay Cravens Disappearances playing at a Block Buster $ Bin near you.",0
"- - Wouldn't just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense? The things the people to bootleg make no sense. Uhm, why?",0
He did this for scale? Too bad the money wasn't spent on a better project. I watched this movie so that you don't have to!,0
"OK... so... Believe me, you'll thank me for the advice! Holy Moly, this was a bad movie!",0
The movie plot seems to have been constructed from a disjointed dream. There is not enough realism to hold the viewer's interest.,0
I guess somebody needed a tax write off. It is not necessary to make movie about it. Complete waste of celluloid.,0

How could I stop them? This image haunted me for weeks. How could my father protect himself? She had no idea a family movie would be so violent. You must realise that this stabbing is not fantasy to a seven - year old.,0
This movie features roaches as super flesh eating killers. In this one they are the star.,0
The Nest reminded me of a much better film called Slugs.,0
Worst movie ever!! !,0
"Honestly, people who gave this movie a ten would have given 100 for pulp fiction. It absolutely killed the movie in some parts. The plot defies logic and belief. "".",0
Umm - that's it. Suffice to say it's poor.,0
"No - one can do what he does as well as he does. 5 on this, the same as films like Pulp fiction or Goodfellas. < br / > < br / > Director, please come up with something original. If not, then skip this film. Hmmm. It does you a disservice to churn out this stuff pretending to be Quentin Tarantino.",0
"Thank God I saw it for free. Sounds exciting, right? So, nothing to blow up. They are to blow up a fuel dump. Yeah.",0
"Its so demeaning to women and men. Nah, that would be to ironic and clever. It's so humiliating. OMG!!",0
"The war scenes were very short and only last couple of minutes. I was really hoping to be touched by this film, but wasn't. < br / > < br / > The movie is poorly filmed.",0
"< br / > < br / > Which brings me to the ultimatum : this is meant to educate us on the events of the Kokoda track. S * * *! It's just a confusing and agonizing pace! Instead of giving us a perfect film with one flaw, we have a horrible mess with one redeeming feature. EVER get to sympathize with.",0
"Basically its rubbish, don't see it, don't buy it.",0
This is most certainly not it. The film is so unsatisfying and obviously unfinished as to be almost laughable.,0
"Movies always kill the sense of realization. Just read history on the internet, mags and in books. In this film it was very terrible and too graphic.",0
The first hour is just one cliché after another. The film was misguided and highlighted the youth of the production team. Both sides fought hard to control the track and no mercy was shown by either side.,0
< br / > < br / > I am not going to join the usual parochial garbage of saying its great because its an Australian film. The film also fails to give a credible account of the Australian soldier and his behaviour in this event. I say either do a great job or just leave it to some one who knows how. This government funded film is just another failure by Australia's wealthy and spoilt rich kids. It is more like an uninformed contemporary view of what is was like.,0
It was nothing more than a wannabe film. First off i'll give this movie a low scoring 4 out of 10! I felt very let down watching this film.,0
Blah blah blah. Hopefully with the recession we will not see the like of this again.,0
"As his voice provides the stories narration it is something that after ten minutes was driving me nuts. Roland Manookian and Frank Harper provide the films only source of authenticity. Having had more than a few mates suggest i check Rise of the Footsoldier out, i eventually got round to it last night. This film sadly compromised in quality by miscasts, appalling accents and woeful acting.",0
This film is a disgrace to British cinema! Unfortunately this film was shockingly bad.,0
"This "" True Life "" story of Carlton Leach ( who? ) This isn't Goodfellas despite the blurb on the DVD cover. The fact that these people are totally unsympathetic is the only minor plus for this film. Why?",0
Blame Guy Ritchie. Sadly Rise of The Footsoldier - the true story of Essex hardnut Carlton Leach - isn't likely to reverse that trend.,0
"Like I said, there is not much of a plot and the storytelling leaves a lot to be desired. It is not in my opinion. Violence resulting from paranoia and fear in general. This movie could have been great. As a result the movie remains shallow as a whole. It is hard to identify with the main character.",0
"The violence, although brilliantly shot, seems excessive and implausible because no one is around long enough for the audience to form an emotional attachment. < br / > < br / > Opening with brutally realistic shots of the dead men, the viewer is left thirsty to understand what happened, but left wholly unsatisfied. The next 2 hours meander through a series of countless character introductions.",0
"The worst kind of film. Boring. < br / > < br / > All the new material, actors sitting around in an airplane set talking, is bland and terrible on every level. A total rip off? There may be more stock footage in this film than in Plan 9 From Outer Space.",0
It is an offense and it is offensive in its purpose. This is a unsavory world which would damage any persons viewing this film as its purpose is to commit an offense. It may any way irregardless of its rating.,0

"Roflcopter! Don't watch this. The "" jokes "" ( I use this term loosely as well ) are simply hilarious. Frostbite is one of those pathetic movies where no one, and I mean no one, is even trying. ( r # 26 ) Apart from that the sole source of entertainment value here is boobs.",0
U couldn't pay me to watch this crap again.,0
The story is absolutely terrible.,0
Perhaps the uninspired go nowhere story? What makes this movie so damn bad?,0
! Don't waste your time and money in this one. Even if you like snowboarding ( and I really do ) you will hate this movie.,0
but that is all the film has to offer.,0
Days of Thunder had heart - pounding racing action. on this quagmire of mediocrity? Frostbite has none of these. You are SO much better than this.,0
Do those even exist?,0
"Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscle to the background as a Navy SEAL. "" Not a good choice. Unfortunately the only cast member who ( in my opinion ) is completely out of place is Coolio. Submerged "" is definitely NOT "" the worst movie ever "".",0
"Any serious snowboarding fan will be disappointed with the quality of the stunts in the movie. The rest was all "" B "" grade tricks or worse. This was the best of the boarding in this movie. Even then, you wont remember a thing from this one two days later. Unfortunately, there was only 4 seconds of backdrop action that might be inspiring. After that there's lots of potty humor and sexual situations.",0
"Not even funny. Ewe, The opening screams zero budget. < br / > < br / > NamoiBucks ; it's just a matter of time before Starbucks sues over that. < br / > < br / > There is nothing good about this movie. NOPE! This movie really did need the nudity too. Leave Frostbite alone. And the nudity is not worth it.",0
"These moments were great, a bit like watching extreme sports channel.",0
"For an ideologue / artist, this is no joke. My mother - in - law lived through the Italian invasion and German occupation... barely. No, they are not even vaguely Greek.",0
The director'approach is didactic. The filmmakers's hand is heavy. Everygirl? Is there some point to this allegory?,0
"Please someone tell guy symbolism has to be subtle. Angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretentiousness. We don't want chewed food. Personally, I think he tried to make a Greek "" Underground "". or "" oh dear "" every two minutes. What a waste of budget and actors. No matter how he tries, he can't reach Kusturica.",0
"The fatal flaws of the movie to me were the lack of any compelling dramatic drive, and a total lack of humor. In the end, I was too bored to finish watching. Symbolism is always fun but it seemed a little dated. As a result, it seemed very abstract, irrelevant to the lives of real people.",0
"A charmer. Good acting by Susan Glover as the sister. Lancaster is boring to watch. And what a bitch of a wife she was. What does that tell you? Yes, dumb is the word for this actress. This time around her hair, folks. I thought it might be the end of her.",0
I was pleasantly pleased with the ending. Thats about all positive I can say about this film.,0
"A terrible script and bad, bad acting. You'd think after a fire fight like that the big U - Haul truck might be riddled - not a scratch.",0
"That is Porky himself of Porkys fame. Jeffrey Combs of Re - Animator fame is in tow, but really he does little in this rather thankless role as a horror obsessed teen that needs to steal a dead man's body for kicks. I do ; however, None of "" kids "" except the pretty girl playing Meg is any good. Well, Frightmare is an interesting "" bad "" film. Sure, it is cheap. Conrad Radzoff in a bad human being in life, living solely for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is even dead ( obviously none of the swinging teens at that point ). Also, look for the big - I mean big - guy that plays the policeman. Nita Talbot plays the "" friend "" of the Radzoffs with withering interest.",0
Why here?,0

How on earth were these guys given funds to make this movie?,0
I wasn't personally a fan of Zozo but at least it had some production value to it. This could have been shot as a high school film project. I would give this a 4. the acting isn't too bad. Actually Falkenberg isn't like some remote northern Swedish village.,0

The man tries to be funny throughout with him taking the mickey of how apparently rappers talk. If pulp fiction and Get shorty didn't exist this might be an OK film. Oh yes i forgot to mention there is a BIG cliché at the end. When i say this i mean that nothing from this film is it's own unless it's another bit of terrible dialogue or a cliché full scene.,0
"They are almost all great. Hopefully they can pull it off. If you have not seen that film, don't watch this. This one,.... it is simply not a worthy addition to the catalog.

I rarely give ratings less than 5, but in this instance I must weigh in.",0
< br / > < br / > As you can guess this is a bad movie. Guess what?,0
"This is worse. That movie while slightly flawed was entirely entertaining. The Rock, Andre 3000, and Vince Vaughn were in a comedy.",0
These are the 2 reasons the movie is so bad. Wait for DVD.,0
The first one wasn't preachy. The 2nd bad role is Edie ( played by Uma Thurman ). < br / > < br / > For a buck rental let'call it even. I'm a fan of Get Shorty. Ho - hum. It's pretty tepid. Travolta looks old here.,0
"There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. John Travolta returns as Chili and he does an okay job. His performance is kind of dull though. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't. He just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of mess.",0
Andre 3000 - Sucked but he went down swinging. John Travolta - Very likable. Sucked. It felt like he was slumming. Wrong. Reminded me of his role in Casino for some reason.,0
"I, for one, was completely captured by the diverse characters and crisp dialogue of the original. Based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, the film focused on wise guy Chili Palmer ( Travolta ) and his attempts to break into the movie business.",0
Get Shorty was an excellent film. Is she supposed to be ditzy or clever? And even Chili doesn't seem to know what's going on. Probably the biggest crime is the plot : IT MAKES NO SENSE.,0
Utter nonsense.,0
"As for adults, stick to Jonathan Swift's original novel. This was painful!",0

"The third one has William Katt, Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell. Another aspect is the terrible acting. Also why did they tie it in with Cyborg anyway? ( Okay so, Cyborg 3's cast isn't that impressive. ) I've never seen Cyborg 3, but I did see this on Sci - Fi channel and must admit I wasn't impressed.",0
"At least, Michel Legrand's score ( with lyrics provided by scriptwriter Don Black ) is serviceable – if not exactly inspired.",0
"The only elements which work are the performances by LeClerc, Sarandon, and Tennant. < br / > < br / > It rates a 4. But alas! < br / > < br / > As an adaptation to the novel, this movie was total suck - fest. This movie failed miserably to live up to its potential. Without powerful people who believe in his work, I fear he will never get the chance.",0

"All of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse, a kidnapping, a brutal beating, and race riot. What I later objected to was the film'handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot. But perhaps not. Besides that, there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences. Sure they can, but that doesn't mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair.",0
"< the 70s? First things first - though I believe Joel Schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often ( as here ) downright bad, the lion's share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a film must go to John Grisham whose novel this is based on. To be honest, objectionable though the underlying message "" Vigilante justice is good "" might be, everything about the movie stinks : the characterizations are pitiful, acting leaden, the direction plodding, the screenplay and the dialogue almost verging on parody. Peter Menzies lush, 50s Technicolor cinematography is pretty but derivative.",0
"It's also convenient that the man killed was presented as totally evil and his guilt was in no doubt, which removes any of the moral ambiguity likely in a real case. There are other reviews here expressing similar views, but I still feel impelled to add my comments. The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ends up advocating vigilante justice.",0
"Yes, there were mitigating circumstances for what he did, but fact remains that he wasn't innocent. Namely, "" A Time To Kill "" sets you up. We're supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. This would have been true no matter what his skin colour, or the skin colour of the assailants of his daughter, the judge, the jury, or anyone else. And oh, by the way, the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in Mississippi, complete with hooded KKK men burning crosses. Carl Lee Hailey was a vigilante.",0
Do juries really acquit people of murder because they feel sorry for them? Shame on them. This is the worst kind of film. Seems like the director didn't feel THAT strongly about sex crime after all. Are black people universally inspiring? Is it really subject that belongs in Hollywood hands?,0
"And i really did my best to enjoy the movie. It had to be as the action it self never is exciting. Waste of time! ( I've seen my share of Japanese movies. So what is left to be enjoyed.

"It's fun to turn off your brain and believe that every shadow caught on camera is not just some shadow, but some insane asylum inmate's tormented spirit or something, so long as you can snap back to the real world later. The show is frankly insulting to the intelligence to the viewer. For awhile I was hooked on shows like Ghost Hunters and Destination Truth and stuff, even though I thought they were full of crap I found them interesting and entertaining, and that's why we watch entertainment TV. Then you have to get high / drunk and watch. Call up an after school club from the state college. They've probably read the Wikipedia article on exorcisms. "" This one is too much for us.",0
"All of these people calling upon a college club to solve their problems. Better leave it to the pros, ie himself. < br / > < br / > Paranormal State has none of this appeal. The whole show is about Ryan and his partner, his enormous ego.",0
"So is Ryan in need of an exorcism already? What a disappointment!!! His voice - overs are campy, not creepy. Why can't he say the name?...",0
The show has many other flaws too. I suppose I should be fair and point out that I don't believe in ghosts. Paranormal State has neither of these qualities. I recommend you avoid.,0
"Hey, are they ghosts too? Or Society. Or Super Adventure Club. Especially when "" Paranormal State "" was juxtaposed against a weak Monday Night Football game. And they run around Pennsylvania researching the most terrible hauntings and the lost plot to an M. Night Shymalan Movie.",0

"" The premise of this story is good : teenagers go out on a boat, meteor lands in water, aliens kill teenagers.",0

The performance by Dan Gordon as Chris is splendid. That is to say if he can get away films like this that will hold him back.

"While this may have been true about some film characters, Bogart's characters rarely fit that bill. Fourth, I've never heard a goofier theme song this side of Mitchell. Second, the film does not have the first rate character actors Bogart was able to work with. There are no Peter Lorre's or Sydney Greenstreet's in this one, folks. Bogart almost * never * played a straight hero, on those occasions he was a hero. This movie makes Bogart out to be a trigger - happy, moralistic do - gooder.

When all is said and done, the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by.

Unintentionally! I saw the movie years later and laughed my head off. Poor Briggite Nielson. The acting is sub par and the action scenes are soso. Her career never had a chance thanks to Cobra and Red Sonja. Together they go on a hunt for Queen Gedren and the orb. The dialog is a hoot also.,0

It gets repetitive very quickly. It isn't when it's done on a low budget.,0
"The makers don't even do anything with the jungle setting, hell I didn't expect Predator ( 1987 ) but I hoped for a bit more than this. There isn't enough exploitation content & is a rather unsatisfying way to spend 90 minutes of your time.",0

In this film, we have Richard Lynch in one scene, a momentary appearance from Martin Kove, a brief spot for Vernon Welles, slightly more time on screen for John Philip Law and a little time for Karen Black. I'd say, avoid. Unfortunately, the film is sadly lacking in suspense, likability and satisfying gore. In fact, aside from the above mentioned cameos this entire movie is really quite stale and turgid with characters that couldn't get offed quick enough for my liking and an unfortunate lack of any real interest.",0

"Maybe, under those conditions, I could actually care. Whom will she choose? They collide with wealthy business man. As - is, frankly, Redford's selfish and manipulative playboy winds up the sympathetic character. Seriously.",0
"But he can't save this film. Only Redford escapes mostly unscathed. Yeah, that'll work. For one night with the wife he will give them financial security. The performances leave much to be desired. Unfortunately nothing in that aftermath is the least bit entertaining. Anguish is not something seems capable of portraying. That pretty much sums up the disaster that is Indecent Proposal. They go to Vegas to get rich. The aftermath of that one night is what the movie is really all about. Quite frankly, we'd have been better off if we didn't have a movie. Why is she a movie star again?",0

As Gage, Redford wears a suit and tie in every scene.",0
Like Redford has to pay for it.,0
"Las Vegas? Redford was dark but not too dark and his character let me down in the end. It never went too deep. I hate hype, it can ruin a movie. There was a keen deepness that outshone the shallowness of John Gages character. He was good too - although kept wondering if he was stoned the whole time. But the reality is, they were losing their dream home and where did they go?",0
Of course Demi is going to accept the offer. If it doesn't there's no second half of the movie. As for the rest...,0
But I also thought Redford's character was a bit of a wimp. That wasn't really the point of the book. SPOILERS THROUGHOUT : < br / > < br / > Not good. It was almost like seeing a completely different movie. He is also fascinating. The fact that such a big change was made in the movie alters the whole plot.,0

Instead of the violent and selfish Sade, he spends a lot of time carefully grooming a young virgin and slowly helps her to explore her own sensuality. What a nice and kind man. I really thought there were no problems at all with these aspects of the film. Only a maniac would let their kids see this as this is a very adult drama.

"The worst thing from "" Harlem nights "" are both the scenario and its terrible decors. 1989 was already a year in where Eddie Murphy wasn't that longer hot and started making movies that soon would be forgotten.",0
That anyone could find this travesty in any way funny or entertaining is mind - boggling.,0
"< br / > < br / > Probably Murphy. He's even got a dirty cop in his employ. None of that here. He is credited all over this. The actors aren't really allowed to stand - out much, if at all. But Pryor comes up with a scheme, a la "" THE STING. """,0
Murphy clearly poured lot of money into this film and a good deal of it shows on screen. This was an idea that probably looked great on paper but it definitely lost something in the translation.,0
"This takes place in 1920s Harlem. A boring, offensive and stupid mess. A 1 all way. Not the worst Murphy movie but pretty close.",0
"Swallowing them only seemed contrived and made no sense - - even for a low - brow comedy. < br / > < br / > In this film, however, the team is at their absolute lowest. As for Zasu, she's a completely annoying moron. Plus, unlike Laurel and Hardy, there was not an ounce of chemistry between Todd and her two co - stars. In the 1930s, Hal Roach Studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase and the Little Rascals.",0
Worth noting is the appearance of Morgan Freeman as Detective Black.,0
Luckily she wasn't. She started with incredible promise in Alien but then had a slew of bombs. It doesn't create any suspense. Sigourney is decent but nothing worth remembering.,0
"At least for the beginning and the end? < br / > < br / > This film just isn't one of them. At last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon. < br / > < br / > I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can't appreciate "" art "". < br / > < br / > * Finally * we get into space.",0
I thought this movie was awful.,0
"I think. I'm only going to write more because it's required. You pretty much know who's in on it from the beginning. < br / > < br / > Many of the actors did an'ok'job. It doesn't help that the movie is even shot like a daytime soap. Though, I wouldn't watch it again, unless I was paid a large sum of money.",0
Immediately one has to question why all the constant narration? Unfortunately I was incorrect.,0
There was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension. And every world had one of the characters falling in love. The writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top.,0
"Die Mommy Die II, the Sequel!! Sheesh, what a waste time.",0
"I have to say, its not very good. The rest are so so. Polly Bergen is fine in this film.",0
"I didn't. What a jerk. But she's not even that. Pleasure to at least see one pretty face in this clinker. That isn't explained. Puts your trust in doctors, huh? If the wife was that attractive, maybe, just maybe, I'd accept it.",0
"I noticed that another film in which he starred was titled "" The Perfect Neighbor. "" Not the case here. < br / > < br / > Whether the referenced miscreant might be the "" neighbor, "" or as in this offering, "" the wife, "" it is always fascinating how easily, successfully and effortlessly they proceed with their dastardly deeds.

"That's right, the Toad is Vice President. Stay tuned. < br / > < br / > It takes all of them the entire film to convince Gossett exactly who Karpathy really is. I suppose as long as they make money and these players can't get jobs in the mainstream film industry.",0
"What the crew and actors lacked in sensibility, professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they display. < br / > < br / > Those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public, as evidenced in comments here. If you get it for $ 2 ( or less ) as did I, you won't feel disappointed, but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made.",0
"It could have been made as a crossover into secular movies. This movie was OK, as far as movies go.",0

"How are you supposed to fear the Antichrist when he's got a comedy Russian accent, and the worst of his powers are some pitiful CGI? Nor, on the copy that I rented did it say anything about it being the third in a series. To someone not in the know it would appear for all intents and purposed that Left Behind : World at War was no different from the latest Tom Clancey. The acting is straight out of an elementary school production and the "" special effects "" would have looked dated in the early 90's. < br / > < br / > Now as a movie it's extremely poor. If you're so firm in your beliefs then why not be honest about it?",0
"This is the sort of stuff you expect to see in an episode of The Amazing Race, not a spy thriller. < br / > < br / > Compounding the film's problems are plot twists and turns which seem designed as nothing more than padding.",0
But the movie never explains his connections with Middle East. The rescue of Roger Ferris alive is also very stupid and corny. My vote is four. Meanwhile Roger has feelings for the local nurse Aisha ( Golshifteh Farahani ) and he gets close to her family.,0
"When will this movie end? "" Why not have Jack Nicholson play an overweight office clerk? I repeatedly thought to myself. Two thousand? What was the casting director thinking? Or Nicole Kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman? By now you get the point. This is called stereotyping.",0

"Horrible! Unless you are blind, because it might go up a few stars if you only listen to it. Horrible actors, horrible direction and producing.",0
What does it show? It shows their living in very poor conditions. The author devoted this film to Andrey Tarkovsky. Another thing.,0

"I would highly suggest this film for people like me that purposely search for these movies, but for all others, beware! The humorous parts are unfunny and the rest is riddled with horrible clichés and plot holes. As one friend so humbly put it, this movie is aborted fetus of the industry. This movie appears to have been filmed with a spare camcorder normally used for birthday parties.",0

"First off Tanzania is a very large country and Lake Victoria is only a small portion of the country. Yes things are BAD within the town of Mwanza but they are far worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter. The film tries to link the introduction of the Perch fish with AIDS, Poverty and Pollution in Tanzania but never makes a direct connection. There are only two attempts to discus the environmental effects of the Nile Perch fish. The fact of the matter is that many of the people they interview say that the fish has provided jobs and opportunity for many. As any intelligent person well read with problems in Africa, the problems shown here are not unique to Tanzania but affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with the fish. The title of this documentary is very misleading.",0

The execution falls flat however, and to say that the movie has it's share of plot holes would be to imply that there actually is a plot.

"Here he is bombastic, petulant slimy, and unravelled. Three "" is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie. Dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the term, she is not. They end up being terrorised by Zane's adrift psycho - killer. The reason for this is it's not very good.",0
< br / > < br / > I have had enough. The Wife is the Einstein. Okay. Bad sitcom.,0
"But it still doesn't save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting. Additionally, when I don't find the movies "" hottie "" to be all that, even the wannabe - sexy love making scenes get dull. Really dull!",0

Yet Billy is probably the guy you want to punch in the face if you meet him. Wouldn't you be upset? They seem to have a great time. Kelly and Billy just lost some dear friends! What the heck is this about?",0

Disappointing.,0
"To see Besser say "" I can't see, I can't see! "" This short is so sloppy. Granted, this is not all Joe Besser's fault. "", filmed years before. Laughable or sad? Are these things not obvious?

"Maybe Besser was a nice guy, but he was all wrong as the third stooge. Do yourself a big favor and don't watch this. This short was released in 1959 and was the team's swan song with Columbia.",0
Don't waste your time on this one. Why oh why did Moe allow all this to happen?,0

They are treated with extreme sensitivity. Both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable. NEVER will a Jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples.,0

In'Kadosh'there are both too little cinema and too little human emotions. I am sorry that I did not postpone indefinitely seeing it.,0
It is TERRIBLE.,0
They then landed on a twenty yard long dock in Africa.,0
That is the high school that everyone else went to. I love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great American sitcom. Or did you go to the high school that had middle - aged people teaching in it? No.,0
The humor in this show seems like it is trying to target an audience with an I. Q. of 40 or below. This is just my opinion but i think these guys should stop now before they humiliate themselves anymore than they have already.,0

"< br / > < br / > Safety Medical Note. It is an old man's film with an excess of 40's plus people. Oh dear me. In truth their is no tenable plot at all.

Merci pour le chocolat "" is the latter of this genre.",0
The beginning of the film is promising.,0

"This movie is something for the lovers of "" real "" cineatique art. It really does not make ANY sense at all. Oh boy, oh boy.",0
"The real Karen Carpenter was much different. Also, Karen wasn't divorced from Tom, but only separated. The music was very good.",0
"Shouldn't she? Perhaps a true comeback would have worked had she returned home peacefully and waited a year or so after her often mocked ankle bracelet was removed. Before going any further, I have to admit that I only saw the first episode of this show. The letter bit was certainly not cliché but obnoxious in the least. Does she have to come off as cold and tough? Maybe America wants Stewart to make a comeback on her own rather than be the basis for it. Sure, she was compelling for a while, and this entire series poses the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business. The fact that Stewart never says, "" You're fired! """,0

"Okay, first I should say that I assume this was just made by a group of friends with a limited budget. With that in mind, it really shouldn't be compared to blockbuster features and my rating would be higher. There were just too many parts where nothing happened. SCARY.",0
"It even had two award mentions on the cover ( I don't remember what festival it won ) so I figured "" Hey this might be good "". So I bought it ( for five euros ) and I came here to IMDb to check out some reviews. The talking in between characters seemed... off. Not just bad, but far away from actual happenings in the movie. I think it was probably the aspect I most disliked in the whole movie. < br / > < br / > Man... The dialog was even worst...",0
"Chico must have been so disinterested that he forgot to use his Italian accent. < br / > < br / > A real mifire. Jumpin'Butterballs, this movie stinks!",0

"Where are the secrets revealed, the confessions and fantasies and regrets? < br / > < br / > First and foremost the film is adapted so faithfully from the Pulitzer - winning stage play that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. This is a fascinating premise that is drained of all vitality and excitement. This film fails in two.",0
"I've become a big fan of the Carpenters, and I didn't really enjoy this movie. The film was more poor - singer - with - anorexia than Karen Carpenter's story, in my opinion.",0
I love Anne Bancroft but she seemed too young for this role. The movie plot was true to the play.,0
Unfortunately he has little screen time.,0
"< br / > < br / > Yup! Yeah, right.",0
I'd not clever or original and it strikes me as being extremely pointless. What an lie.,0

"This film could have included longer, better interviews with the people themselves, letting them tell their stories.

"Apparently the film was keeping them afloat. Paxton's character has hijacked Hamill's prisoner, an android taking his name from the poet Byron ( Bob Peck ). The real question though is why didn't he just fire the device at Byron thereby cutting out the middleman. But you can't convince me that the film makes sense on any level.",0
Get rid of the stuffy museum people. The story and the characters really REALLY needed work. Just get people talking about something we care about.,0
"The cinematography is pretty awful. I realize this isn't going to get remixed for 5. 90 minutes of your life, you'll never get back. Also, the sound was bad.",0
Does this song have any relevance to movie? Don't think so.,0
"The cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone. This is a film that really makes me cringe. ! Unfortunately, Columbia Picture's cynical ploy worked!",0
Aside from that prepare for some sweet zzzzz's.,0
"His best friend as a boy was Pappas, a retarded adult played terribly by Robin Williams. That sounds about right. He has been pretending to be French all this time. That's just one of several huge plot holes in this movie. The script didn't give her much to work with.",0
"It's not. Don't be fooled, this movie blows chunks. What it does is bore you. When you do get an explanation, it doesn't fit the story that went before it. For all the acting talent in the film, it just isn't interesting.",0
"She's shocked when years later he reveals his "" secret "" to her! They weren't great, let me put it that way.",0
"So simple, that the movie is not evolving until the end. And I completely blew with my high expectations. And he didn't have to, because his less crazy behavior was creepy enough. If not her, i would give this movie 1 star. Now, Joseph Gordon - Levitt, is a good looking actor, but he played his character a little unnatural. < br / > < br / > In conclusion, I expected to see some well played movie and some interesting plot.",0
"While the story itself provides precious few twists and turns, sadly by the end of the film its appeal still remains a mystery. The characters, situations, and even resolutions in the film are all tired and unoriginal and only very randomly hint at something more.",0
"I pirated it and wish I never even wasted the hard drive space. If I spent 10 bucks to see this in theaters I would kill myself. Acting is OK at best, there's no action really and there is definitely no thrills. The whole movie I was waiting for something good to happen but it never came.",0
Mickey Rourke had a really annoying sidekick who did nothing but irritate you from the start.,0
"etc. ) Rosario Dawson had a horrible role, I can't believe would even accept it, it was such a misuse of her talent I can't even put into words. Killshot was a major disappointment on so many levels.",0
"The director should have recognized this and helped movie along. Combs was miscast in this, and did a poor job of it. Everything he did seemed fake or contrived. < br / > < br / > The script is poor.",0
He has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene. Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men. Killshot is no different. < br / > < br / > Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies. Yet Dawson does a good job with it.,0
! And it got better.,0
The FBI seems to work extra fast here. < br / > < br / > The acting was good. Everything was well done. Even the weather enhanced the mood of the movie.,0
"Oh and what "" characters "" they are. Truly appalling waste of space. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The police would be beating his door down in minutes. And the native American theme is just awful and pointless. The scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. No idea. Angry?",0
"The plot was thin. Ugh. And so much could have been done to make this a much better movie. But then, we would not have had a movie then, would we? He would have popped them right then and there. The acting was horrid, the entire movie predictable down to the minute, and even the ending. And why did the realtor even agree to the extortion?",0
"Why they even went into the witness protection program, I don't know. Okay I will take that one. It's starting to get real weak. Why he didn't shoot the woman on her porch, I don't know. Why the killer didn't just kill everyone at the real estate agency I don't know. Why the girlfriend was even in the movie, I don't know. For one, there are way too many coincidences.",0
This shows and confirms my dislike for him. Instead they made Killshot a complete and utter joke. ? Thomas Jane plays her protective husband. I think he'got action star in his blood. What in the Lord's name were they thinking? Rourke playing a Native Canadian / American hit - man?!?!,0
"After the first twenty minutes, you'll be yelling at the screen, "" Oh, come on! The movie has no detectable humor. Nobody's THAT stupid!! """,0
"That must be a good one "". I thought wrong. All in all, rather mediocre.",0

"< br / > < br / > Then there is the dialogue. These two actors have done some excellent work in their long careers and made some very fine films. Felony'is a B - movie. But honestly, why bother? It is at times silly, at times cliché, and at times unbelievable... everything you have come to expect from a B - movie. Silly... but I suppose if the bad guys were so logical there would be no movie. No doubt about it.",0
"The locales are often breathtaking. The script is horribly muddled. Gosling is, as always, pretty darn outstanding. I didn't miss much.",0
"Ok, so I saw this movie at this year's Sundance, and I was sorely unimpressed. I removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject.",0
This is melodrama at its peak. Big disappointment. Nuf said. I'm somebody who looks at details in films. 2.,0
"A final point, and a spoiler : Perhaps the Breen Office mandated it, but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second? But what's really surprising is how horribly overacted the triangle is, on all sides. Stanwyck may temporarily have regressed into being an obedient wifey, but I give the marriage a month.",0
< br / > < br / > The directing displayed this all perfectly. < br / > < br / > The acting and writing was a little to clichéd for my liking. Now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie. What exactly was won their. The director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in Vietnam. To me this movie was offensive. This movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects.,0
"If you watch WE WERE SOLDIERS you can ` t help but be reminded of these two films. It starred Mel Gibson who also directed and was scripted by Randall Wallace. They are, but very few Americans believed The film contains over 200 errors. I mean what ` s the connection between Scotland and ` Nam? Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART?",0
"Otherwise the two are incomparable. This film has been compared to the hilarious British comedy "" A Fish Called Wanda "", although I can't see why. When the getaway goes wrong, the two are forced to take refuge in a convent, as nuns. Once again there are the occasional high spots, but neither cast nor crew manage to inspire proceedings.",0
"Personally, I didn't care for Boyer's character for a minute, so the tension was utterly nonexistent. Meanwhile, he falls for Lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. Atmosphere and droll dialog don't redeem this overrated classic. It sounds exciting... too bad we didn't see it for ourselves. Sigrid Gurie is the wildly - overacting jealous girlfriend of Boyer.",0
0 to finally get the green light. And the editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty.,0
"Frankly, Algiers is cheap as far as imitations go.",0
"< br / > < br / > Boyer's performance was good, and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. First was the idea that the police wouldn't enter the Casbah. The movie itself, unfortunately, was quite a letdown. 3 / 10 I just found it impossible to believe that someone like le Moko would fall into such a trap.",0
"i don't mind anger fueled comedy, but george could have done so much better. and on top of that, it wasn't even funny. you are all diseased appeals to dumb people who can't handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct. let me first just say that in the past, i have been a huge carlin fan. i think george is one of the smartest people and best comedians on the planet.",0
Some of the acting is fair.,0
"God's Army "" abandons any pretext of universality and runs headlong into the stilted and myopic world of the orthodox. A little known fact is that Mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films. Of course the cast's sorry performances aren't helped any by Dutcher's pathetic script.",0
50. Utterly un - funny.,0
What a waste of talent and beauty it was? I consider this to be the worst ever movie I hv seen. Donno why actors agree on doin movie like this.,0
"All three of these travesties the makers of this film are guilty of. A score of'1'is too good for this waste of celluloid. This is, hands - down, the worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen thousands.",0
Rajpal Yadav's sequences. Poor and flawed story. Govinda. < br / > < br / > 2.,0
"I read somewhere, that this was supposed to be Govinda'comeback vehicle. Salman just overacted to the hilt. Please stay away form this one! This one was a complete bit y bit rip off Hitch. If thats true, then only God can save his career.",0
"< br / > < br / > It's a horrible, horrible, horrible copy of the movie'Hitch. If I could go lower, I would have given it a - 100 rating.",0
So it's just luck. But it was a really good movie. Overall Partner is a disposable film with disposable actress Katrina Kaif. Its better off that she is kicked out of Bollywood and never comes back again. She is completely crap.,0
Well this is what happened. But ultimately it finds only Salman Khan Bare Chested. According to the movie script it would chase anyone. < br / > < br / > And i heaved a sigh of relief. 001 to believe that.,0
"What was the director thinking? But it insults the original one. 1 "", "" Hero No. This is not a good movie. I ADVISE THE VIEWERS TO WATCH IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.",0
Her acting is weak... but she still shines. If I'm correct. Hitch... Lara Dutta is a plus...,0
He sucks. He does not know how to do comedy. ! Talk about over acting...!!!,0
"< br / > < br / > The "" special effects "" were awful. I couldn't. Avoid. < br / > < br / > "" But how what will they eat?",0
"Rajpal Yadav co - stars. F Then why would we need to see Salman Khan re - enact this? Therein lies the $ 64, 000 question.",0
Coming to Execution of the movie. What a pity! In the movie Govinda looks like Grandpa of Katrina Kaif.,0
He is not at his best doing roles like this. Govinda looks way past his prime. That movie was dull.,0
This movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together. He's just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 1 / 2 hours.,0
"At least watch "" Hit "" if you have watched Partner to be able to compare. The Hindi version fails to keep the viewers interested. The plot in the original is tightly executed.",0
I do know that I will never watch this disaster again.,0
And to think I paid £7 to see this! Yeah that'll please the masses. How can anyone watch this film and recommend it to others? No real substance to it all happy and shallow. What a trivial load of drive.,0

"< br / > < br / > Let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review. It is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation - - a natural extension where mere words fail. There, the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate, often delightful, plot lines.",0
But this film should have gone same way as their marriages and ended in divorce.,0
Lots. It just felt so good when stopped.,0
You've got to witness to understand!! < br / > < br / > I could keep going. For the whole mankind. Meryl did that before. She's also disastrous! And I love musicals! ).,0
"The entire cast seems to be on speed. Structure, please! I didn't quite get the director's intentions if any. This is one hell of a mess and I loved Abba.",0
"It isn't funny. Louis Aubinard, for example... played by... Bob Hoskins? < br / > < The movie also stars the equally French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson. Although all the situations are unbelievable, they are logical within the film's own bizarro world.",0
"Its pretty stupid, pretty annoying, and very poorly done. This movie is not that good at all.",0
"What shameless abandon the making of this "" film "" was. It firmly establishes the bottom of the barrel. He plays Deputy Jake Barker. Now filmmakers know what to aim above when making a movie. Other than that I regret watching this debacle. You might remember her from Gus Van Sant's'Elephant '.",0

The director'comments and reasons were weak.,0
"The most suspenseful parts were in the beginning of the movie, however. < br / > < br / > The story was dragged out for waaaay too long. Robert Redford has given much better performances.",0
The movie is just not worth it. I'm also a fan of her British detectives.,0
Wrong. What an unemotional film.,0
< br / > < br / > The plot is ludicrous. Give me a break!,0
perhaps... uh.. Oscar?,0
Truly a masterpiece.,0
"Boring, boring, boring.",0
"To me history and truth mean a lot. Here brother was a LOT younger. The movie is about the novels 1950s version. Some actors were GREAT but that doesn't cover the plot. Yes, Rome burned down. She was just an excuse. Well it's not. As if there was only ONE pyramid build. < br / > < br / > First we get the caveman story. Inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the movie. I'm an atheist.",0
"To paraphrase Robert Redford, the villain was a meaningless piece of crap!",0
"Only towards the climax of this movie does she get to show herself, but by then the viewer has quit caring. < br / > < br / > Fine actors are wasted here. Robert Redford does his best trying to engage and outwit Willem Dafoe. I agree, she's a great actress.",0
"Times. Who wrote this script..... Bill Clinton? Ha ha. Times says it's "" an intelligent thriller. """,0
Stay with it! Ten minutes at least. Say you're being kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun. Don't just strangle him for ten seconds. And I wanted to shoot him as well.,0
"Cause he was, once, fired? ? Why is this guy unemployed for... eight years??? I don't think so cause it is too melodramatic for that. < br / > < br / > Is it supposed to be an "" art "" film?? Totally unrealistic. What's so bad about Redford's character's life that he has to "" clear it ""??",0
It's so much funnier now that I know that. I'll admit it ; I had trouble breathing at points.,0
"Well, it's not! Cheerleader Massacre is entertaining, that's for sure. So how could this even be good? But since when did slasher films have to be good? This movie's all boobs, but unfortunately no blood, or not enough.",0

"And a bad one at that. I always thought him to be a true camp genius, with a winner almost every time. They are what they are : campy movies you watch when you want to have a good time. Then, the announcement of a title change. I had been waiting for a new installment for literally years. I was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see it. No longer would this new sequel be titled "" Slumber Party Massacre IV, "" but "" Cheerleader Massacre "" instead.",0
"The prosecutor is the devil, played with fiendish glee by Vincent Price. I can't understand why many seem to hate this. Most of the other performances are well done, though. There is something called "" The Great Clock of Outer Space, "" which, when striking midnight, may signal the end of the world. The Spririt of Man is incidentally played quite well by Ronald Coleman, in his last film.",0
"LOVE THEM! Wynorski utilized this deception, fourteen years earlier, in his horrible version of "" Not of This Earth. "" I am very forgiving of the horror genre. < br / > < br / And, that's bad.

! ANYTHING else!,0
"Ok. I'm a huge fan of b - movies. Skip this turkey and go rent "" Slumber Party Massacre. I'll admit it.",0
Yes it ends up all over them. This movie is very very bad. There is a spot with deleted scenes. Don't bother.,0

"Really lame. As for the actual murderer? We had a good larf at that. The only reason to bother with it is to laugh, a lot, at the badness. This movie was just plain bad.",0
"It looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the actors aren't all that good. There is no gore, no on screen murders and no chainsaw, as the box art would lead you to believe. This one certainly does not. The ending ends up being ridiculous mess. 2 out of 10. Again, this film could have been OK if the gore quotient was upped a bit.",0
"This film is terrible, really. Well, Mr. Wynorski gotta have an awful sense of humour then! The only good reason to watch this turkey are the girls : if this film were a porn, I think it would have worked really much better! < br / > < br / > Watch at your own risk. Some moments of slight thrilling can't save a nonexistent plot.",0
"The Plot. At the same time, the local sheriff's department is hunting down a dangerous killer. Boy was it cheap and horribly bad. It felt unnatural and it seemed as thought it was very scripted. Not even the tag line fit the movie.",0
"Like CURSE OF THE KOMODO was for the creature feature genre, Jim Wynorski's CHEERLEADER MASSACRE is a straight - faced parody of slasher movies, such as SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. Meanwhile the sheriff of the county and his deputy pursue the whereabouts of their psycho, while also trying to find the location of the missing cheerleader squad. Luckily the group find a cabin up ahead, but fall prey to a killer who attacks each victim one by one.",0
"The rest of the movie doesn't bear mentioning. I was really looking forward to seeing it. I can almost justify TV Guide's error, in that the Marx Brothers - - Groucho, Chico, and Harpo - - appear in both movies. < br / > < br / > TV Guide, I sent you a nice letter, I'm still waiting for an apology. What a disappointment.",0
Absolutely terrible...,0
"In Wynorski's "" Bare Wench 2, "" he didn't try to develop a plot. And that's what makes it the worst of all bad movies. Cheerleader Masscare "" is no fun. It was fun and it was titillating. "" But then again, it's a Jim Wynorski film. So it's not even worth enjoying on an erotic level. Unlike a lot of B - horror films, this one's actually boring.",0
"And a crazy killer who wants them all dead! < br / > < br / > Well, Cheerleader Massacre delivers on the former and definitely the latter, but unfortunately is a tad light when it comes to the splatter. < br / > < br / > I do care, however, about the movie's numerous lacklustre deaths. They make their way on foot to a deserted mountain retreat, where they find food and shelter.",0
This movie is utter garbage! < br / > < br / > Cheerleader Massacre is an exact polar opposite of the original Slumber Party Massacre. Stay away by all means!,0
"Though it wears out its welcome eventually, even at its short length.",0
I mean Come on now!! Sadly even my mediocre expectations were not met.,0
"The suspense is completely absent as is the gore and nudity. Zinda Laash "" almost put me to sleep. Tabani succeeds in putting the bite on Shabnam and once turned she tries to lure her young niece away. Aqil'brother races against time to put a stop to the vampire curse. """,0
"This was so poorly made, I was in disbelief.",0
"But these actors are much better then this "" movie "" deserves. They were Tripods and the aliens worked in threes. THE BLACK HOLE. The effects and the cast work fine.",0
Interesting. < br / > < br / > Gary Busey creepy as an army LT.,0
"Was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions? Then when the focus is on the individual stories, you want to scream in agony. If it was satire, it just doesn't get off the ground. Irwin Allen's first venture into all star spectacle was one all star disaster. The Story of Mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. Colman and Price plead their case before The Judge played by Cedric Hardwicke.",0
< br / > < br / > Script - Terrible. Production Values - I'll start with the good stuff. The look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest. Look at his performance in The Hitcher and compare it to this movie. The set - ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad. Also camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others. There is no comparison. Why does C Thomas Howell do these movies? Hysterical.,0
"One of my favorite "" bum "" actors, C. Tom Howell, stars in this tepid remake of WOTW. Have you seen any of those? Yikes! It also was one of The Asylum productions.",0
And overpriced at that. < br / > < br / > The acting from the entire ensemble struggled to rise above the risible and failed. Very good.,0
"The laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have tipped us off. One woman finally says "" it's gi - normous! "" The son asks, quietly worried "" will I ever see you again? "" The gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious.",0
Imagine that! It probably gives him nightmares. This movie is so bad they should burn the master.,0
"Oh, I remember him from The Outsiders! "" I said to myself. And nothing was really. So I thought, it might have been a try. The Spielberg version is coming out near the end of this month, buy that one! It couldn't have come onto DVD, that fast, could it? "" What the crap? But please, please, I beg of you! Something was going to disappoint me in this film and it did.",0
"In 2005 alone he produced 11 movies! It made no sense! The next time Latt wants to make a movie, someone needs to slap him. WHERE WERE THE TRIPODS?",0
"< br / > < br / > Where do I start? Ginormus "" and "" dick skinners "" just doesn't really cut it. Not a one. Sure I'll admit that I also mistakenly picked this up thinking it was the Spielberg version. He has a black back pack that randomly appears and disappears throughout the film. What the hell is that? None of the performances were any good. When he gets to New Hope he just happens to stumble onto his dying brother.",0
And so I must throw in with the more humble Latt / Howel version.,0
"Still you should, d see it for the sake of seeing how a low budget version of War of the Worlds CAN be made even with flaws. 4 out of 10.",0
"Probably a stereotypical English speaking point of view, at least if you take the side of the film.",0
"I was actually embarrassed for him. Thomas Howell's emoting would not be acceptable in most high school drama clubs. This Grade "" B "" ( "" C ""? )",0
There was no real plot.,0
"When it comes to characterization, the only bright spot is the friendship between Ayeka and Ryoko. < br / > < br / > This is not Tenchi. No!",0
Nothing new there. A past love of Yosho's is the bad guy. I gave this movie a vote 4.,0
It is a standard ex - cop flick. This film is a complete waste of time. All BIG surprises ( NOT!!! ).,0
The perfect 6 step recipe for a boring middle of the road movie : < br / > < br / > 1. ).,0
"The clichéd "" ladies man, "" the only one that didn't get his fortune told was just annoying. Yeah, I'm being harsh. He was funny, genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie. Honestly, it wasn't that bad, it was just blah. This one was literally 10 minutes of an idea stretched another 81 boring minutes. Then, nothing happens. On the way home, two decide to get their fortunes told by a "" gypsy, "" as they call her.",0
This movie is unbelievably bland. Where is their Bob Denver?,0
KK should stick to singing - this whole movie was a big bore. 00 to rent.,0
"Now this is a really bad crowd. I guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it isn't quite the same for a viewer. This is shown in gory detail. They don't just shoplift and smoke dope, nosireebib. < br / > < br / > The ending is about as unsatisfying as any movie you'll ever see. < br / > < br / > As it stands, it is just abysmal. The sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable, the little kid is detestable.",0
"If he's right, that's far more shocking than anything in "" Sailor "".",0
What about an interesting script and good performances? Aren't we smarter than that?,0
Basically a road movie.,0
The dramatic content is a token appendage - they hardly try to get you to take seriously.,0
Spa us.,0
feeling.,0
"Apart from that you are going to love some special effects, they are really cheesy and bad.",0
( Gasp! ) Pitiful.,0
"But like so many others, it's material isn't strong enough to successfully fill a couple of hours. Characters shouldn't laugh at their own gag. < br / > < br / > The real trouble is with the dialogue. They run into lots of trouble - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their pasts.",0
"< br / > < br / > So what's my problem? Priscilla, Queen of the Desert "" is always being trotted out as a masterpiece of Australian cinema. Tick's wife doesn't get much better treatment. I found it quite disappointing. First, there is not a sympathetic female character in the whole film. < br / > < br / > So, all in all, a waste of a good idea and a great cast. Well, three things.",0
* * from * * * ).,0
"but the story just wasn't very good or very interesting either. I must say I bought the guys as the performers ( the correct term? ) I think that was part of the point, I don't know.",0
"< br / > < br / > Another problem is the format. You can't get back the minutes of life you would waste on this film. I don't. Great Balls of Fire is the movie you show to someone you really, really hate. Talk about "" family values. "" I came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax dummy. Where was the director to reign in this guy? He struts and mugs as if on some incredibly bad acid trip. Thank you Dennis, you gave us a bad performance for the ages. But who really cares?",0
"And he's doing too much to prove it. Music is fine too, because Mr. Lewis himself is singing.",0
"The rest of the crew is almost as bad... save for Winona Ryder, who does her best with the crappy lines given to her. And it's a damn shame! The otherwise fine actor Dennis Quaid is putting on what must be one of the worst performances of an actor in many a moon! Everybody in this movie are like cartoon figures of the real people involved... from wild man himself to Sun Records Sam Philips! A charismatic and interesting artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves better and I hope he took the 500. Add to this a bunch of actors who doesn't know if they are participating in a drama, comedy or a little bit of both! 000 dollars he got from the deal and told the company to go f * * k themselves... twice!",0
"That is why this really can't be classified as a biopic, but more of a inaccurate news reel. Cut to a scene where he first meets his second cousin, Myra. 1 and so on. We can already guess that there had to be a lot more to Jerry Lee Lewis than what is depicted here. Absolutely, no basis in reality. Just re - saw this last night and to put it bluntly : "" Style instead of substance "".",0
"It's simply an Anglophobe'retort to the Anglophiles. The answer is that this isn't a deep or well - thought out film. That's as far as it goes. < br / > < br / > WRONG. Bravo. Off to an interesting start, eh?",0
"Terrible... Quaid's acting seems to imply that Jerry never acted like a human being. If people were like this, no one would bother to hang around them.",0
It's really just terrible. Quaid overacts more than Shatner.,0
"Baldwin never made me believe a single word. Wynona Ryder's part was best, and she was mediocre.",0
"This movie easily falls into the category of laughable, if not beyond that to actually insulting.",0
< br / > < br / > What is with the artist's drawing of feet? STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the imagination of the video game. Any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive. Spoilers abound. Guy?,0
"That is why this anime fails! Why? And there were not many of them! Isn't Streetfighter about fighting! I recognized Rose, Zanghief and Birdie! And what happened to the other characters from the video game! To me this is odd! In this movie it is all about Ryu!",0
!,0
"I'm not big on the genre. ) If you like westerns, this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in. 3 / 10 Ball's performance was OK - nothing really more than that ; she didn't blow me away.",0
And I love comedies!,0
"And Van Devere is pretty good also. But the script is against them. But his mother keeps scaring her away. The cast is the only thing that kept me watching. That was ( thankfully ) changed. THIS is a comedy? < br / > < br / > A real lousy, sick film. I give it a 1.",0
"On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands. The car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch. < br / > < br / > The scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious. The special effects are well, "" special "" - for example, the external train shots are very obviously a model train. The acting is generally pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie.",0
"Ruth Gordon's characterization is dreadful as the mother. By the end, it's clear she's just nuts. < br / > < br / > Segal's performance is about the only thing holding the picture together. ; where the film fails is in other areas. This is not the mode of a senile person.",0
"< br / > < br / > But alas, "" Where's Poppa "" drags. Why doesn't this work? Plot developments are also very slow.",0
This is one of the worst directed and edited films I have ever seen from so - called professionals.,0
"has some funny moments, but it also has a lot of flat ones and the overall product is amazingly bland. George Segal lives with his elderly and senile mother. The problem here, though, is that WHERE'S POPPA? Plus topics such as homosexual rape, incest and like are really difficult to make funny.",0
"I can't believe how many good reviews I read on here. After watching it I felt it was my duty to let the world know about this. Don't say I didn't warn you. Ok, where to start.",0
"Even the villain Toecutter feels modeled off Alex of "" Clockwork "" only uglier and completely unimposing. This first film was mostly a waste of time. Its a terribly cliché B - movie technique.",0
"Or My Mom Will Shoot? I mean, who wouldn't watch this before Stop! Whoever wrote the script had some wit definitely!",0
This movie involves little imagination whatsoever. ( note I have yet to give a movie a 1 star. I know her as Billie. They seem to exel at that. Rent before you buy on this one. And little else. 2 out of 10.,0
"So the end result is arousing nor entertaining. And yes, it's about as confused and silly as it sounds. If there is i don't want to know about it. I caught this movie on late - night TV. Well, there is one... Krista Allen is amazingly hot. < br / > < br / > To sum things up.",0
Ugh! I did my best to watch this two hour fiasco. Special effects are unbelievably bad.,0
The problem with the film is mainly the script. Except for De Kok the acting is OK. The characters are not believable.,0
"La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, or Terror Express! as it was called on the version I saw, starts as various passengers board a long distance train. The script by George Eastman as Luigi Montefiori could just as easily be described as a really boring porno as much as a horror / thriller.",0
"Since a lot of the film is taken up by these sex scenes, this becomes a massive problem.",0
"Pretty soon, they are revelling in their temporary control. < br / > < br / > La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto gets off to a decent start. Various intriguing characters are introduced, and the three hoodlums are shown to have a genuinely unsettling influence over the travellers.",0
"If you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets, this is your film. Terror Express "" should be in the porn - section of videostores. They provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females. On the night train from Rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok.",0
Never a good sign! Fox's generally respectable career.,0
This isn't a bad movie.,0
"* 1 / 2 from * * * * Slickly produced, but ultimatelytale.",0
"< br / > < br / > Please, don't waste your time. Please. < br / > < br / > The only smart thing they did was blur all of special effects to make them harder to see.",0
"However, this is a dreadful film. It is sad to have to say that a film is truly awful and one tries to find ways around saying this.",0
Directors fault?,0
Viet Nam I'm guessing was not like video game....,0
He's just about always reliable. Propaganda? The myth was real enough. Why would our former enemy refuse to return MIAs? To add labor supply? They need a hundred extra laborers in Vietnam and Laos? That's why Asian helpers appear in movies like this. < br / > < br / > But how about the movie itself?,0
I'd have to say that Pixel Perfect was a digrace.,0
"If the girl can't sing, have someone who can record music!",0
"Don't bother to watch it. Final remark, bad film. The story is bad. Yuck.",0
I give 0 stars!,0
"I gave it a 1 because I have never seen such a bad movie. Well, the pain started right from the beginning. Even nice guys can still be cool.",0
"The actors are all a bunch of stereotypical - genre characters. And what about exploding helicopter! * THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS... OR MAYBE NOT. Except Diamond Phillips. No comments there, but I think the guy was desperate to find a job. In this case, an alien in a train. Wow.",0
"I, myself, with no film making experience could do better.",0
I noticed some people gave it a 10. If the movie sucked give it a bad rating if it was good give it a good rating but don't lie.,0
This is entertaining and it then becomes a big laughing comedy.,0
"My God, how the HECK can anybody label these as "" movies ""?? The actors look like they'training with their gym buddy. ? I hadn't seen any of this guy's latter movies after Cyborg Cop. His final 3 movies have to frankly be the WORST I have ever had to sit through.",0
They must be. 1 screen - savers. < br / > < br / > - Floppy disks can be read even after they've been shot up.,0
Anyway. Clearly he was chosen to make Jala look good in comparison. Worst film I have seen for a long long time.,0
"! comparing this movie to the Matrix is easily the WORST comparison I have EVER seen. Wow, was it bad!! The camera shots make it so that you can't see whats going on. Why does EVERY single bad guy have to die in slow motion?",0
But geez! I don't think anyone in this film even hums. Or any of that music that fills elevators.,0
"It'a thrilling, exciting movie worth a watch. Sorry! Anyway they end up getting out and saved. The critters eat stuff in the kitchen ( Spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene???! ) * The first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is'Gremlins '. It's the only critters movie I have seen from the four movies, but I enjoyed it.",0
"Sadly, this movie is not very good. But does it really matter?",0
"The cop hero's sidekick must die, we all know that. Yeah, Lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym. Local law enforcement is summoned. < br / > < br / > The train stops. < br / > < br / > The train leaves. Oh, can it be?",0
"The script by David J. Schow is strictly by - the - numbers & very predictable. But will the group be able to defeat the Critters & prevent themselves from becoming dinner? are heading back home from a vacation. Suddenly the tyre on their van blows & they have to stop at a public rest area to fix it. Josh also makes an appearance as his Stepfather ( William Dennis Hunt ) owns the building. < br / > < br / > Directed Kristine Peterson I thought Critters 3 was an incredibly undistinguished film, but at least she can say she made a film staring Leonardo DiCaprio & not many people can say that! Charlie tells them the story of the Critters & the town of Grovers Bend but they don't believe him.",0
"I like watching this well known actors in their early roles. < br / > < br / > 4 / 10 < br / > < br / > Really a too silly and lame movie. It makes "" Critters 3 "" a real redundant sequel, you can easily do without. This movie is way more of a B - movie, that is silly but for all of the wrong reasons.",0
I chose to give it three. Why?,0
"< br / > < br / > Overall : Nothing new here, it's a generic and boring film. This would be dull even if it hadn't been done before. Especially when they have absolutely no connection to or use in the film ).",0
Nowhere but down!,0
But when I saw it was the biggest deception of my life.,0
"One of the better songs, but that's not saying much. It didn't deserve to win from my point of view. Animals singing? This year's Eurovision was to me a big disappointment.",0
Didn't impress my kids either.,0
I watched in amazement all the while saying no wonder they remade it. I must say that I was extremely disappointed!,0
The dialogue was so bad it was sickening.,0
"I was in 6th grade and this movie aired on PBS during a series called'Wonderworks. < br / > < br / > Last year, I finally tracked down a VHS copy of the show. I probably should have stuck with my memories.",0
"I have to agree with them, at times, it was pretty bad. My students were mimicking the lines and making fun off and on the whole way through. They laughed out loud!",0
"Rhodes is captured in a raid. Now for the bad... All this drags the movie down and it never picks up. So I was somewhat hopeful that this newest version would be good. On top of that they decided to do Iron Man and his opponents all in CGI. Boy was I wrong! Things go strangely, impeding progress in restoring the temple. And its not even the big fight at the end. Stark, shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady, is informed Bad CGI.",0
But the final film was unsatisfying. Even on it'own it seem stick - like and lifeless. I wasn't expecting them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to Iron Man gray armor. The red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together. This was something I had been looking forward to seeing.,0
"Where were we? First off, the plot was uninspired... at least. ).",0
"CG animation's okay, but far from impressive. But it's not directed exclusively at children. So I get a little peeved when he looks at comic book fans as an extension of that same market. How many lukewarm receptions do Marvel have to endure before they come up with a better strategy?",0
"That's a lie. First of all, the title "" DAILY "" is a LIE. However, its veracity is low.",0
"I do remember four years ago when he "" interviewed "" John Kerry. That Mancia guy makes me barf. He'll take Al Queda's side over Bush any day. It was like, "" Get room, you guys "". Call me shallow. I just don't like smirky little traitors who peddle their propaganda.",0
"Comedy works best when it relates to stuff that's true. Thr first years of Jon Stewart's reign were arguably golden, I though he was so funny, but then 2004 came along and it's where you start to notice a huge chance in the show from there on.",0
angelfire.,0
"He spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a box. Then it lands on the hood of a car, coming in horizontally. < br / > < br / > The special effects really deserve their own paragraph. And save the day. About 10 times too big. Later on Lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train.",0
The facts to back this up speak for themselves. Then the lame Palin jokes will become ratings grabbers.,0
"However, think about it : an outdated kids'movie? What's the point? All of us hated it with a passion.",0
"And if you don t want to waste your time. Stay away from this movie if you want to prevent going "" What? "" "", a lot. There were a few funny parts, but that's about it. Ignore the people who say this is a very funny movie... it isn't. Just stay away from it at all costs... please.",0
What was the movie about? Satire?,0
"A terrible low low budget backwood - flic of the worst kind, sort of AND... therefore quite charming and funny to watch... at least on my tv set!!! !",0
The only good thing I have to say about the film is with regards to the music ; which is good in places.,0
"Ultimately, it'a lot of talk and little else.",0
Even the outstanding cinematography left me uninspired.,0
The rest of the special effects goes downhill from there.,0
< br / > < br / > I recommend you listen to me if you still watch it come back and rate this comment as useful after wards to help people avoid this waste money. < br / > < br / > Half the people on the theater left including my 4 friends who waited outside since they were really bored so was I but I always wait till the end of the movie.,0
"This movie is horrible! Okay, I guess.",0
Michael Caine's character has problems. What's the poor fellow to do?,0
All topless.,0
This was distracting.,0
It's rather pathetic and grotesque. And then to throw herself at him shamelessly? Ugh! This movie should be called Blame it on the Script.,0
"Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper fall short. < br / > < br / > Michael Caine is pure class, as always.",0
"Michelle's acting prowess leaves a great deal to be desired. No wonder we haven't seen her in anything else. """,0
"What a disappointment! Maybe I am in a bad mood tonight. Then again, maybe not. I am a big fan of sci - fi movies. All in all, an awful movie.",0
It tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable.,0
There's the leather queen. This gets a 2 only for the frequent male nudity of some very nice bodies. this movie slides slowly into disaster. There's the young kid Danny who is there for his first time. A couple Peter ( Craig Dudley ) and Buddy ( J.,0
? Really painful. Scary!,0
The plot does not seem to develop.,0
It'just not worth watching. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.,0
"Ugh. A gimmick. A hook for unsuspecting audience. Half of the movie is narrated, for chrissakes. I guess.. if the movie wasn't dull, dull, dull. You aren't watching the movie, you are listening to Jim Carrey narrating the movie.",0
"Walter Sparrow ( Jim Carrey in a rare non - comical role ) is a bored animal trapper whose wife Agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday. The Number 23 "" is not suspenseful, in spite of several gloom Nothing helps, however, simply due to the sheer silliness of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired engagement of cast & crew. Well, that's just crazy! There was a time when Joel Schumacher was ranked quite high on my list of favorite directors. The book tells about all sorts of devilish theories and strange coincidences that are linked to the number 23.",0
Boring piece of... well. The number is killing him? I hope I never see this kid in another movie again. Totally unbelievable. < br / > < br / > 3 / 10. So what? About 1 / 3 into the movie things go downhill.,0
"No. Not just because of that theme in the movie. But it wasn't funny. I HATE numerology. Just exactly the dumb sort of "" Isn't this totally scary and yet amazingly cool?! But I hardly ever stop watching a movie I started. I enjoy the pain. dialog I was afraid of.",0
"Kinda like an old - man flick if you ask me. ! What the hell was this? I mean who are we kidding, they should have made someone else the killer of that girl. How would that have shaken our heads?",0
"I mean, come on really!",0
"No. This role is a sad and peculiar devolvement for Jimbo. And don't expect an embodiment of a character as he did with Andy Kaufman. Schumacher keeps his film dark and blood - red and gloomy and rainy and smoggy and gloomy and rainy and dank and on and on and on from beginning to end. I know, we don't need him. Oh yeah, 23 is also my record in Cuervo shots at my favorite dive on 23rd street in the 23rd state in the union. Assign the number any way you choose and ooh be very scared.",0
"Perhaps it works for game, but surely it doesn't in the cinema. No, but it looks good. What he did with Batman is just disaster, but probably Batman movies supposed to look good. No You can't. Private eye on the suicide? Why? But hey, what can an actor do without good story and proper directing. Is it natural? He can do "" Number 23 "". Who cares, let's go on with the story. Instead we get Moulder / Scully routine. Hardly believable. Well, they didn't.",0
"He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. He switches from reality to what's actually happening in book which quickly got annoying. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension.",0
The story is laughable. And that adds up to 23. This is the most stupid movie ever made. His wife and kid think he's insane. Then they don't.,0
"Didn't buy it for a second. Additionally, the casting of Jim Carrey was justwrong. We'll just say something like, ""... Or did the book find her?. "" The film opens with a group of giggling high schoolers mulling about on a subway train platform. Deeply disturbing?",0
The story is just weak. This movie has no respect for the viewer's time.,0
"Or Toppsy? ? Why did the wife dig up the body? But, there are so many I lost track of the story completely because of them. < br / > < br / > Of course, you expect plot holes in a film like this.",0
"< br / > < br / > This film is not for everyone and I can understand why it wasn't pushed by the suits. We never get to meet his wife, nor the rich philanthropist who is sponsoring the ill - fated mission, but, we do get a solid display from Lewis.",0
"Then this flick is for you. Was a college acting class exercise filmed and released as a movie? Yeah, most of us have. Do doors shutting terrify you?",0
Those movies made fun of how BAD they were. The old Japanese 60's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked. Beyond awful. < br / > < br / > But enough of that. Their reviews are TOO good. Calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shills. It's utter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain.,0
No one at all. Is Sara going crazy?,0
"But this movie didn't do it. It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly. Good lord! "".",0
There is no direction. But this is ridiculous. She is almost unwatchable.,0
This one simply stank.,0
She has one mean and ugly - looking expression.,0
< br / > < br / > Just bad.,0
"Could she be the culprit, or perhaps the explanation could be something of a more ethereal nature? Go back and get the correct one, short - sighted gimp. The film starts well enough. Hmm, I wonder who the police's main suspect will be? So yep, life is grand. This is quickly followed by more deaths, all linked by their relation to our heroine having been on bad terms with them before their passing. The young daughter only manages to escape with the aid of a mysterious spectre, who kills the two aggressors while she covers in a downstairs cupboard.",0

"The focus on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is nice, but way over used.

"Watch it on television. Well, it was, but still it was somewhat worth it.",0
horrible god awful.,0
Picking on this movie is like picking on a 5 year old for not knowing the alphabet. Was this movie anything special? People don't seem to agree with me that movies can be bad and good at the same time. Of course not. Is Carrot Top funny?,0
< br / > < br / > Funny comedy?,0

"Carrot Top is not an actor, and IS NOT funny in the slightest sense.",0
"Yes, the votes are in. This film may very well be the Plan 9 From Outer Space for our generation. None of it is, not even a nanosecond of it is funny. Obviously Mike was suffering a classic reaction to trauma. Viewing this atrocity was so soul numbing, Mike Nelson had to block it from his mind. Indeed, if one goes to Amazon.",0
He plays a surfing inventor who comes upon a man who has a flat tire. !,0
Carrot Top is so unfunny it's nauseating to watch. I'm not sure it's in the bottom 50 of all time but for the $ 10 million spent it'a disgrace.,0
There are many mysteries in life. Nuff said. Why did anyone pay money to see it?,0
I would not recommend this movie. Come on.,0
"< br / > < br / > And yet. If so, I envy you. This movie tests that theory. It's like watching the antics of very bad comedians.",0
This movie was a complete disaster for me.,0
This is a movie that should have been a mini - series as it tries to get too much information in too small a space. The production values are superb but resulting movie is a waste of time ; wash your socks instead. Each one comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer.,0
"The action sequences are handled pretty disappointingly, and the ending sucks pretty bad. Brian Cox is also wasted as Garcia's firm and frank superior. By the way, his name is'nt really Poo, I just feel like calling it him.",0
"Another movie with a star of a wrestling. The acting is horrible, possibly from the bad director. This movie is no exception. < br / > < br / > The action is dreadful.",0

I don't review movies. You people that actually got thrills off of this scare me. I couldn't stop laughing at how absolutely ridiculous it was. Exercise your brain America! I'm not quite sure how to even put it into words.,0
< br / > < br / > Even though Keatons character was a joke i routed for him all the way. Did the movie turn comedy right there? Exceptionally bad!,0

He's a secondary character in the grand scheme. Words can scarcely describe this movie. This is not a Michael Dorn movie.,0
"Why are they all in this? Dunno... but the movie was half - baked - - - not really "" finished. "" Yeah - - - for 1965. I suspect it was 1 ) The work, and some money, even if modest. Dorn appears to have a nice presence, and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career.",0
If you want a silent movie that captures that presence try ( Le Dernier Combat ). Absolute dbble!,0
"In the end, I was absolutely disappointed with this feature.",0
Let us not forget how weak the characters become. SHRINKING!! ( It's sad I know ). It doesn't even feel like Dragonball. Might've been better if Toriyama san worked on it.,0

I absolutely cannot recommend this movie.,0
They don't celebrate it again for many years. I wonder if any other viewers would recognize those comments.,0
"I think so anyway - at that point my mother hauled me out of the cinema. Believe me, you don't need to see Norman Wisdom's backside. I saw it again, many years later, and guess what, it was still dire. plays a swinger aiming to get off with as many'birds'as possible.",0
"The dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially, but as you get towards the end, it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly. Of course, a monstrous murderer ( played by Kane ) also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes. It's too generic to be scary. < br / > < br / > The movie's gory, no doubt, but it's only there for the effect. And that's sort of the main problem with "" See No Evil "".

The Pretty Things appear as themselves performing a number of good tunes in a nightclub and Norm himself sings catchy title track!,0
"It has no soul and no originality. But the script is lame, really lame. Nice cinematography. The thing is... Well acted, yes.",0
And take someone else's children to live in a devastated barn... that's too much. Why didn't Monika escort her boy to work abroad? Cramped sentimentality everywhere. Young Czech couples do it very often.,0
"So what is the point of staying with this drama? Beats the heck out of me. I kept thinking ( or hoping ) there would be some sort of plot twist or new revelation, but none was forthcoming.",0
< br / > < br / > And frankly I couldn't buy it. That's what were asked to believe here. A lot of good players get really wasted in this one. Unlike what one reviewer said this is NOT a ripoff of Magnum Force. Then it's open season. Just how far they sanction the exact methods used is open to question.,0
"Oh boy, was I to be DISAPPOINTED. I bought the region 3 DVD, which was cheap ( 7 bucks!!! ) < br / > < br / > According to the dull nature of this film, the following is gonna be a WARNING more than a REVIEW.",0
I honestly would just say STAY AWAY. Anyone who's watched enough of that series can see where its makers are coming from.,0
"But there's some cool action sequences here and there and the movie's unintentional laughs factor certainly keeps it alive with a pulse. But, then things get out of hand and getting out alive might be harder than he thought. The title doesn't make any sense either.",0
It will do little to change your opinion. Rating 6 / 10 < br / > < br / > The acting is pretty bland and unremarkable. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. See No Evil is a good example of this. There's really no suspense just some gory death scenes. It was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikable. The death scenes themselves are pretty good and gruesome.,0
!,0
Probably! Its that feeling right here.,0
First : The recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax. It definitely has that feeling. It seems to be about nothing.,0
It is so offensive in its clichéd depictions of obvious and easy targets it was fully rejected by the very audience it was intended. It is as if the producers thought teens would watch any ugly trash and just slung - together scenes and characters who were shallow and soul less. What a nasty cynical film. Well the were very wrong.,0
Only great character : Kirresha.,0
"sound. Seriously, I couldn't find anything that constituted a rational human thought in this movie. I also saw at least five actors with overactive terrets syndrome and stage 10 syphilis. I understand that this was about gymnastics, but seriously, what's with all the roaring and human bleating?",0
"She is constantly called "" white girl "" and other slurs based on her colour. All in all a charmless film that was a waste of time.",0
Please put this tired franchise to rest. Solange Knowles pretty much grimace through the entire movie.,0
"< br / > < br / > So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? 4 ) Tons and tons of gore. All right, let's be realistic about this. 2 ) A fairly non - existent, clichéd storyline.",0
Not. The first two Bring It On movies were both quite good in their own ways.,0
Stars : Hayden Pantierre.,0
I do think Olivia did a great job. I give it a 3 for poor acting by main male character.,0
"< br / > < br / > We're trying hard now to erase the memory. From all the rave reviews, we couldn't wait to see this show.",0
He's also the one that earned the show a one - star rating. < br / > < br / > And I found the characters were annoying.,0
"< br / > < br / > No better than a 2 / 10 in my opinion. Definitely a movie Gene Hackman would like to forget. In this case, however, I was sorely disappointed. Quite frankly, it just wasn't a very interesting movie.",0
No real sub - plots.,0
< br / > < br / > Gene Hackman plays a locker room Popey Doyle. The same can be said about Barbara Hershey. Maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy. No reason was ever given.,0
"In Hoosiers, there is not much content. There are different aspects a sports movie can take.",0
< br / > < br / > That being said.... < br / > < br / > This movie is one large steaming pile of cliché.,0
"I understand the director wants to try to do something artsy. Unfortunately, they FAIL at protecting themselves from embarrassment. Give me a break!",0
If you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers there are much better alternatives. I recommend going to your local library.,0
"But after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around her palm and one scene with a big band - aid, it was as if she'd never been cut. < br / > < br / > Sure, the script has Last night, I attended a screening of Badland with my cousin. My anger reached its peak - - I won't spoil this moment for you - - in Celina's final scene.",0
"And really, the ending? How dare you. Its a catastrophe. It foreshadows EVERYTHING you're supposed to feel, and sometimes gives you wrong clues entirely! Cannot! You cannot have sympathy for a character who does this.",0
"No offence to 10 year olds. But that is as far as it goes, he certainly will never have co's acting abilities.",0
Wire transfers? The sound editing? Like this one.,0
He truly represents a colossal casting failure. Alexis Karriker as Nina might have been the best except for the limitations expressed above. < br / > < br / > The actors playing the new cabin owners are worthy of truly bad acting nominations as well. A big thumbs down.,0
"Producer Richard Gordon lured Karloff away from Hollywood - where his movie career had become stalled in a B - movie rut ( VOODOO ISLAND, FRANKENSTEIN 1970, etc. ) ), but the narrative is motivated chiefly by Karloff's altruistic pursuit of an anaesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during surgery. CORRIDORS OF BLOOD < br / > < br / > Aspect ratio : 1. - for a couple of lurid shockers in which good men are thwarted by circumstances beyond their control.",0
"A lot. Simply put, I was amazingly disappointed. It's wholly predictable, but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant. And when it is not ripping - off other movies, it's boring, and hard to sit through. I'm a huge fan of Asian Horror, and I can watch unoriginality ( I myself enjoyed "" The Red Shoes "" and "" Phone "" ), but this was just poor.",0
It immediately sets the mood! But there is a main difference! Simply put : This isn't a scary movie! The twist is interesting but no real shocker!,0
"The mystery element is un - involving and handled with little grace. There are scenes taken directly from Ringu, Dark Water, Shutter, The Grudge series, and a smattering of Pulse for good measure. The amnesia gimmick is lazy. < br / > < br / > There is just nothing to grasp onto with this film. No! "" Even the score feels borrowed and cliché. Making matters worse, the half dozen female leads all dress and read their lines alike, making them impossible to tell apart. And The Ghost is a very boring film.",0
"My advice : buy the book from E - Bay, rent something more entertaining like Solomon and Sheba and then call it night! In comparison to other "" sand and sandal "" fare, The Egyptian leaves much to be desired.",0
So this movie has Nothing common with reality. Prisoners in Russia also don't work outside the prison.,0
I hope that Seagal will make some new good movies in future. Good luck for him! I am sorry but i don't have any respect for anyone who liked this movie.,0
Why on earth does five US keep repeating this one?,0
It was an amazing speech. He is done. Umm.... Every movie is the same.,0
( - ) Nothing here worth watching except for the most die - hard Seagal fans.,0

It only gets worse as movie progresses.,0

Why was this film made? Which ONE does the title refer to? The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time. ).,0
That's how much he liked it. If I forget the origins of the story I might consider it a reasonably good epic. I am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive.,0
"Even those Seagal groupies should shy away from this movie. No one should bother with this tripe. How stupid. The martial arts, the typical Aikido, are horrible. < br / > < br / > One word : Sucked! There are zero reasons to see this movie.",0
I am a fan of his... Everything! It just blew.,0
? Bad acting?,0
"In addition, Seagul looks fat and.",0
< br / > < br / > THE GOOD PARTS Mr Segal is a pro. Disecting a'Black - box'- recorder in a hotel room? Very strange and unbeliveable plot. First : I like S Segal! Wow.,0
"Even as straight to video fod, this is not worth a view even for Seagal fans. Even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow. Give it a wide berth!",0
"It's a shame it is no longer available on CD. The actors, however, never rise to the occasion. Tommy Rettig is jarringly American.",0
< br / > < br / > Honestly : Stay away!,0
"My wife still thinks he looks good in black jeans, however.",0
Can they possibly get any worse than this? Probably. Don't put all the blame on Seagal for this clunk.,0
Mr. < br / > < br / > Sver - - old fan with hurt feelings.,0
It looks very low budget ( even for Seagal ). Several totally pointless killings of innocent civilians. Its worse than awful. Its guaranteed to put you to sleep.,0
"This carries over to the directorial style, which relies on hackneyed'grainy shot / slow motion'shots every 10 seconds, along with wire work and hyperactive jump cuts. And bombings. And he's so chunky ( and vain about it ) that he never actually takes off his knee length duster on camera. Instead what we got is a glum, mean - spirited, nihilistic, cryptic mare's nest of muddled motives, tangled alliances and back - shootings. < br / > < br / > Segal himself is just awful in this.",0
"Is seagal being set up? I'll start with the good points..., It's got stylish direction for a DTV movie and has wonderful scenry... That's it! Why are bad guys after it? ).",0
"OK, I can live with a more complex story even though it's a Seagal movie. When you watch a Seagal movie, you expect good action. It's very, very confusing indeed. And I know I'm not the only one. And : you expect a rather simple story. Terrible.",0

"For me, it just didn't seem like GI Joe at all.",0
: ) I speak badly of G. I. J. : T. M. mostly because I think it lacked something that G. I. Joe had.,0
Which raises your question WHY DID I WATCH IT THROUGHOUT? YES.,0
"Who writes these scripts??????????? Oh yes, and then we get the Hollywood SUPERVILLAIN. ? I only watched it because Yuki Amami is so HOT.",0
I just don't know. But why was it in movie?,0
The script is just a revenge story and no surprises take place during the course of the film. He's a fine actor but here he seems to be in over his head. Roberts hairstyle is perfect for the 1980's but this is suppose to be 1890! We know Giannini is going to get it and it seemed just a matter of time. The cast is top notch and they do their best but the whole film comes across as uninspired. Berrigan grows impatient and hires a bunch of thugs to force everyone to vacate.,0
"Weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. Thank you.",0
It shows in every scene.,0
"this was pretty bad. dialogue sucked, relationships lacked chemistry. Why?",0
< br / > < br / > This movie is awful.,0
The actors cannot act. The wardrobe could have been much better. Maybe there is hope for it. There is no plot.,0
< br / > < br / > 3. This one was actually a surprise. Seeing a woman beaten isn't my idea of comedy.,0
Wow. The flats were bare and lacked personality. < br / > < br / > Thirdly the actors. Advice to the director?,0

"Otherwise, don't bother.",0
"First of all, Katherine Hepburn is badly miscast as Clara. Suicide?",0
"Hence the sorry lot of judges, photographers, associations. Bad, bad, Tyra and crew. But Hence the name of the show. < br / > < br / > This is the dream of some girls, and good for them. Heck, I'm trying to see what happened to the ones that DID win, actually. In watching this I hope other girls that see this and run like Hades the other way - like to college.",0
"And unfortunately, by the time the movie ends, the surroundings are suburbs of Los Angeles. This movie is standard goofy sci - fi fare from the 50s. Whoops! The end that the scientist - heroes plan for Kronos is based on nothing but pseudo - scientific gibberish. Low and behold, this causes our unwanted visitor to release its collected energy. Why wouldn't they just suck it out of a STAR!?!?",0
It is a classic. Well I finally resaw it on DVD.,0
"There's no need for questions afterwards. That is it. It is really, really, really boring. Is this the kind of science we are handing out? This movie is bad on all three fronts.",0
< br / > < br / > There's a problem with Kronos'locomotion too. But it's doubtful the writers could explain it either. The film doesn't make much of these squashed people. And now they're running out of energy on the other planet. Good. < br / > < br / > Maybe you'll be able to fill me in on some of scientific questions raised by Kronos'mission. Are you taking notes on this?,0
It's a perfect film for the Cold War. < br / > < br / > The players look like they're having grand old time mouthing as many clichéd lines the writers could put in the script. And Jeff Morrow assures us we'll be ready for them in the future. It would certainly take a lot of time for just this one Kronos to perform that task.,0
"It would have been better. First, it is not cute. What a waste of time and money! Santa and a snowman declaring war on each other is a movie about giving? Other times, he was simply a zombie.",0
This film is just the opposite. The wait was unbearable. Yes.,0
"I mean, Tim Mcintire as Wasco? Yet I could not put it down. Little Arv. Raunchy, crude, foul, lewd... you name it, it had it. Why even name credit this thing with THE RAP? < br / > < br / > Well, as for the flick... it was deplorable.",0
A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days.,0
"Given the choice I'd rent dvds of the show instead of this movie. Its not bad, but its not very good either. More than once I looked at the TV oddly because things didn't seem right.",0
I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season. It's called taste.,0
"< br / > < br / > Skip it, maybe find yourself a nice real documentary / Heres a hint, real people can't act, but actors can usually act real. I caught a screening of this at the True / False Documentary film festival in Columbia, Missouri, and I was pretty disappointed.",0
Those kinds of compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960's. I know we shouldn't expect much from a low - budget indie film.,0
"These people are few confused and each remind me of dog chasing its tail. and don't get me started on Dr. Gary. sad, very sad. < br / > < br / > He keeps making the same mistakes, and is no longer interesting to watch. C'mon pull yourselves together. Danny is beyond sorry.",0

Your enjoyment of this film will depend upon your tolerance for Rugggles and his nonsense. yes finale on the train was exciting but it didn't make up for everything that went before. Not worth searching out but if you stumble upon it give it a try.,0
"I should check new episodes to see if N'Sync make a special appearance. At least in old show Adam was not a spoiled brat! Ha! Anyway, let's leave the old stuff alone. Man, does this show remind me to the 1996 Flash Gordon stinkbomb cartoon! I found myself hating his guts.",0
"In the mountains of Japan, forlorn young artist Sessue Hayakawa ( as Tatsu aka "" The Dragon Painter "" ) paints magnificent landscapes. He prays "" Divinity "" will restore his fiancée, whom he believes was changed into a dragon, 1, 000 years ago. Fortunately, a print of this film found, in France, and restored.",0
"I found myself staring up at the ceiling, trying to forget that face. It didn't help in the slightest. It is far, FAR too scary.",0
"But that is in spite of, not thanks to acting. But it all falls down from poor performances from all the cast. Thank God he curses and smokes during it. This movie describes a truly horrific event, to be sure. < br / > < br / > His emotional "" NOOOO!!! """,0
This film sucks.,0
I couldn't laugh hard enough. As if modeling was doing great things for mankind. Please. < br / > < br / > And then there's the ubiquitous Ms. Banks ( as in laughing all the way to the... ).,0
To suicide?? Fox trapped by his feet on a VC tunnel.,0
"And movie betrays its conservative agenda in the manner in which this subplot is resolved. < br / > < br / > It's simply that the whole movie is too tame and well - mannered for its own good. I ask you! Is the ending of this film believable? There is precious little danger, dirt or drama.",0
"I'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful, though.",0
"And there are continuation discs that follow. I love bluegrass music, so I couldn't wait to see it. But besides that, it was an okay movie. If I were you, I would skip movie and just get the music. * SPOILERS!",0
I gave it a 4.,0
This has got to be the worst show I have ever seen.,0
"Stereotypes / Countertypes! But there are some elements that I hate in a show like this. Finally, Why is the Trivette the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the sidekick an equal ass - kicker? Again, this is what Middle Red State America sees of these people. Now!",0
The acting left me totally cold and uninvolved. Save your money for something worthwhile.,0
This series is formulaic and boring. Certainly not Norris's best work.,0
< br / > < br / > I cringe every time I see even a commercial for this show. I can't even watch his older movies without thinking of this show. Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. It's for the elderly. < br / > < br / > This show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. This show doesn't take place in this reality.,0
This TV show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on TV today.,0
Its all Norris.,0

"The fact that Alex Cahill loves him shows just how dumb blondes really are. And Trivett is the ultimate clown in black - face. But like those shows, in the same way as those shows, Walker TR is just as insulting and just plain silly. As if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at time. What a terrible series!",0
At least Knightride had the talking car.,0
What was up with that?,0
Poor Diane Arbus ( whoever she was ).,0
"In the movie, wolfman moves into the apartment above hers. She seemingly becomes obsessed with him and falls for him. Bizarre. I think you can find better films out there.",0
"The actors portraying the parents are fine. < br / > < br / > The story is modest to a fault. Tamara Anderson and her family are moving once again, as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape. The dialog is very natural and Boland can't quite pull it off. Fifteen years old, she is in her rebellious stage.",0
"There's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. A really very bad movie, with a very few good moments or qualities. < br / > < br / > People start getting killed, either in their dreams, or sucked into hell or something. The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie.",0
"A letdown from "" Secretary "". I could have liked this if I didn't like Diane Arbus.",0
I won't wait for sequel.,0
I wish I had not wasted my time to watch this movie.,0
"Independent of that, it is also just dopey and dull.",0
"Whoa. Had't really heard too much about this movie so I went and saw it. And then the movie went downhill. That scene, the dialouge, were all great.",0
"The mystery to me is why people of some talent and intelligence chose to be involved with this film in any way. Kidman portrays her as wan and vague, whereas she was someone who knocked people over with her charisma.",0
"Paradoxically, it's the very use of Diane Arbus'name and knowledge to her life and work, that sets this film up to fail on a grand scale. < br / > < br / > What follows is a kind of pretty and trivial Beauty & the Beast fantasy biopic with Robert Downey JR as Kidman's hairy fictional love interest.",0
"But I keep going back to McGoverns performance, because it's truly moving. If only he'd trust that it doesn't have to be tarted up with silly fantasy stuff. In a not totally successful attempt to be taken seriously, and move into'adult'films, Mr. Hughes gives us this film about a young married couple. Kevin Bacon ( and his hair ) is pretty good as her husband, but McGovern steals the movie with her quiet true moments of honesty.",0

The dialog? < br / > < br / > The editing was horrible. Please! It sounded like a white man was trying too hard to write this film.,0
"I recommend The Stations of Bach. Why not just make a documentary? The music, of course, is another story. Very stark, very drab, no real drama. Bach's life, of course, was not an Errol Flynn movie.",0
"I don't know of of any good movies about Bach. Someone will make one someday. I wouldn't even call it a movie. Until then just keepwatching _ Amadeus _. Like another reviewer, I really wanted to like this movie. As I recall, the camera never even moved. Truly pathetic.",0
"Yes. "" No way.",0
PDQ Bach did it better.,0
"Put a little effort into it, if you're going to this for a living. Uninteresting framing, unsteady, even static shots are done carelessly. I was bored with it. And that's OK, not everyone is pretty.",0

"Avoid. Some other questions are raised though, like why on earth would Mickey Rourke be in this film?",0
"This movie is poorly executed on many levels, the one bright spot being the ever consistent Sidney Poitier. Instead, he bumbles about in broad daylight, parading a mishmash of shoddy disguises.

Compare that with its predecessor's fight scenes that look like they took months and months to prepare. Skip it entirely.

Also, if you have not seen it yet, don't spoil it by seeing this version first. I never felt like I was into the movie yet I felt like I was watching people act.

"This would be bearable if there was the remotest possibility of him ending up in a concrete overcoat, but sadly he survives to irritate another day. Richard Donner shows off his liberal credentials with this ludicrously overcooked simplistic attack on the politics of South Africa.",0
As for the film itself it has at least three major flaws. The third flaw was in the ending.,0
But not entirely unpleasant.,0
"I guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great music and bad acting, and I did enjoy it, but I just expected more. Though it does have a fairy tale ending.",0

"How awful was it? In a sentence, the story strings together like an exposition of overused Hollywood clichés. For example almost every on - screen explosion is the same fire effect matted over the screen. The movie is basically Con Air meets Aliens done with the semblance of your average film school production. The Salena Incident is no different. The prisoners escape and run into the town of Salena where they encounter the aliens who...",0
If I was still 5 I might find it scary. It is ( I guess ) a low budget film.,0
"Look, the whole film sucks as it's badly written, thought out & made. They decide to head to the nearest town, Salena several miles away & take the cops with them as hostage. Funny stuff actually, unfortunately The Salena Incident is supposed to be a sci - fi horror film not a comedy. I can't really be bothered to go into why but trust me The Salena Incident is awful on every level.",0
Then again maybe they just couldn't get it together.,0
It's an absolute shocker. I totally concur with all your sentiments and add these. Surely no - one actually invested money to make this movie? Right on Colmyster.,0

"She reminded me of a earlier version of Sue Lyon as Lolita ( 1962 ), only a more innocent Lolita. I happened to have seen this movie this morning on TCM.

The rear guard takes up position from which they are clearly spotted by the enemy and exposed. Truly the most inept soldiers I've ever seen. Remember it is deep winter and the ground is frozen. Now that was funny. The soldiers take cover in a cave. Examples : at the start the 2 - star General is given strategic advice by a Lieutenant and accepts it unquestionably. Yeah right! They pound our heroes from high ground but this superior fire power makes little difference. Later the survivors wade pathetically slowly and chest high through a river to return to their unit.,0

"the plot of the movie is hardly original, even for its time. yes, there is some loud screaming, and yes people die, but who cares. the film didn't have a clear direction. anyway, this movie was painfully slow at times, while other times was chaotic and repetitive. much too slow getting to any sort of pay off, if you can call it that.",0

"University Professor Justin Thorne ( Jimmy Smits ) has got it made. The next day, he is being charged with her rape, and his perfect life could be forever ruined. The script is awkward and unconvincing ; the acting is, for most part, not much better.

But even viewed with low expectations, "" Gross Misconduct "" is a huge flop.",0
"A tedious mixture of puerile efforts at humour with romantic relationship melodrama fails to provide this weakly made film with any flavour of reality. Unfortunately, the rapacious team of Chad and Nicole, whose every action is ostensibly laced with lust, is likely to disrupt any future wedding intentions of Reno. Reno is bent upon patenting and merchandising a type of sporting travel bag and, as he has given an engagement ring to Holly, the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial significance if he intends to advance his marital plan.",0

Torture is illegal. And we agree with a previous post, we would give this 0 stars, if at all possible. They will watch it, and want to kill themselves. And I've seen a lot of movies.",0

Don't see this movie! Also how could this movie suck so bad? < br / > < br / > I later finished Puddle Cruiser.,0

"Maybe you gotta be high for it to really be funny? I dunno. ! I tell you what, if I had seen this movie before I saw Super Troopers ( which by the way, is a kick A $ $ movie!!! Club Dread was a pretty good movie, but this one, just wow. ), I never ever would have watched it!",0
That was funny. Susanna sucked. Felix Bean the main character sucked.,0
it was not well made at all. the acting was horrible.,0
I did and was still disappointed. And the Rugby game didn't even resemble rugby.,0
"A far cry from Super Troopers. All in all, I was very disappointed.",0
In fact it is so silly it is almost embarrassing.,0
Who parachuted in for this one bit?,0
"Catherine'imagination only runs away with her at Northanger, with Henry there to correct her gently. Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? 'All of these oddities and more simply are too strange to be overlooked To make the story more ` horrible? Why portray General Tilney as a drunk?

"For he is, like Vinterberg and S. K. Jacobsen a skilled and educated director. I have seen all of the Dogme films, and this TKIA, is by far the worst.",0

"< br / > < br / > Its story also isn't that interesting. It just was custom for an early'40's to have likable man characters in it. You can wonder though, why they shot this western in full color. Of course they were not as friendly in real life as portrayed in this movie. The story gets sillier and sillier as it heads toward its ending.",0
I generally love the BBC's productions but this one is horrid. The time it takes to watch this movie ( which is only 1. Honestly!! The addition of poorly done fantasy scenes make Catherine seem insufferably silly.,0
"An Italian / American co - production co - starring Linda Blair and David'The Hoff'Hasselhoff : how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat? One by one, victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex ( which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs ), before meeting a terrible fate.",0
Tech details : rubbish. What a bloody nuisance!,0
They'll tell you what war is like! Probably because that is the only thing German film - making is good at. I only saw the first part of this and concluded that I wouldn't miss anything if I didn't watch the second episode. My advice : Read Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegu instead.,0
"The Downfall was a very good example for a good TV - movie but there was probably some executive or producer who knew what he was doing. But why do they try to fulfill typical commercial Hollywood - rules? The next thing : It is also poorly directed. It's way below average. Dresden had great expectations because of its spectacular theme and its high budget. The actors are not bad but there is no performance that is touching in any way. it really feels like the screenwriter did a weekend - class with some American scriptwriting - guru and then delivered this mess. I was really looking forward to it and I really wanted it to be good... but it is not. The only good thing are the special effects that are very well done, but, like in a really bad Hollywood blockbuster, everything else is missing.",0
"It wasn't that the film is stripped of almost all context surrounding World War II. The makers of this movie believe so. Damned Americans! "", she screams, while watching as far off bombs fall. No It's really the Americans behind the inhumane targeting of German civilians. Well, not quite. Was the bombing of Dresden a war crime?",0
The story line is implausible and defies credulity.,0
Anyone understood what the last words were?,0

"The truth is it never builds any real suspense. Picture a cross between "" Swamp Thing "" and Chaka from "" Land of the Lost "" and you'll get the idea. Every time he appears on screen he looks plain bored. Nothing like the artwork on the cover box I assure you. The premise is interesting and sounded promising. Boy, was I wrong! I'm not sure what it is but there seems to be some curse when it comes to films about the elusive Bigfoot. As for the creature, where do I start? man with pitch black skin and patches of fur here and there.",0
"Its not her. And he's bald! These shots are from the point of view ( POV ) of the Sasquatch. Now, the nude scene with Andrea Roth.",0
"But, come on! Saxophone music for an early 19th century film? It totally didn't fit. I give it a 30 %.",0
"Ridiculous! Andrea undresses her jeans, and the guide says :'Nice butts, but the shot needs to be in your arm '. Further, they realize that a Sasquatch, a kind of Big Foot, is chasing them.",0
! It numb you to death.,0
"No, not really. Will they survive? This was apparently only the second movie he directed, so maybe he will learn and make really good stuff in the future. But he is overdoing it. At the end of the movie it gets a bit exciting too. Well, if he is good in the future, sure, watch this crap and wonder how he ever got to make a third one. < br / > < br / > So I actually liked this movie? Skipping the boring bits.",0
"Then ulterior motives for the expedition are revealed and that only adds to the already existing tension. A plane carrying a rich scientist's daughter goes down in thick wilderness. Of course the audience knows there is something stalking the characters, just read the title! They actually knock off'Predator'quite shamelessly. The low - budget horror film'Wendigo'did what this film tries to do much better.",0
"And when the creature is finally seen, the costume is not bad, though nothing great. The sasquatch is unseen, but sees the mountain climbers'body heat ( like the alien in "" Predator "" ), and I did wonder when it was going to strike. And their behavior become increasingly stupid. The acting is passable, as is the background music. And it actually generates some suspense at first. Bigfoot movies tend to be bad, so I'm not inclined to watch them. The dense wooded location is well - used.",0
I give it an F -. There's like fade out every two minutes. Don't watch this movie. Don't waste your time.,0
"< br / > < br / > Later Jeff Hey all, I just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie. com and check out some "" behind the scenes "" photos.",0

"You can watch it, if on TV. It has bizarre tempo that goes just... wrong. Kidding.",0
In fact it happens during every scene too. 1. Do you like it when the screen fades to black during a TVM? This is a really bad film that deserves far less than its rating of 5. We sure will. It could be a bear.,0
Starting at the top... poorly adapted. Poor Jane Austen.,0
"As far as good points, there are none, and therefore I gave this movie a 2 out of 10. < br / > < br / > Neither was the plot line all that great. I literally had to keep myself from falling asleep during this movie as it attempted to frighten me out of my wits. Unfortunately, for SASQUATCH, none of these things seem to take place.",0
Don't watch! The acting actually isn't so bad. Wrong.,0
"Not much else happens. Whatever Jonas Quastel's trick is, it worked. The French title for this movie says it all : "" Inexplicable "". < br / > < br / > There's really not much to say about this film. Avoid it like arsenic. How can you possibly make a movie this unbelievably bad in this day and age?",0
I didn't cry. Maybe we should start a support Lance fund or something. Why is he doing this? I wanted to send him money after this.,0
"< br / > < br / > The potential was there. The monster costume, once we actually get to see it, was more than sufficient for my tastes. < br / > < br / > Oy, what a mess this film was!",0
"In fact, this whole film is an exercise ( Get it? ROWWR!! They were tolerable in their own ways ( mostly, because they featured Rachel McLish. ).",0

"I cannot believe how utterly crappy this steaming pile of dog turd was. ! Movies you can make a laughter out of, like Island City, Battlefield Earth or Conan The Destroyer. NEMESIS 4?!?!?! And it just continues over and over.",0
I did not like the end scene. Mr Tilney appears dressed only in his waistcoat.,0

The language is also very tame.,0
Pretty poor! Also starring Pat Hingle as Vernon.,0
"Actors are prostitutes inter - bred with car salesmen. Go see it, it really is good!

"< br / > < br / > The supporting cast was anything but likable people. He was the worst. It's another Disney flop. Yecch! ( You have to see it, to appreciate it. )",0
"Only with this movie, it truly is a near miss. And that's a shame, since everything was in place to make this another classic. Too bad a hackneyed script and an incompetent director as good as neutralize their efforts.",0
"There are some hilarious moments throughout ; the opening'Magnavolt'commercial, for instance, but this is a poor follow - up to truly great original. A pointless cash - in with nothing to contribute except nastiness, this is a definite case of sloppy seconds for Robocop. The droll Tom Noonan has nothing to work with as the villain, while Nancy Allen is badly wasted as Robocop's partner.",0
What an awful adaptation. The only character that didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy.,0
? Why does Hollywood make such bad sequels? < br / > < br / > And what's with RoboCop?,0
"< br / > Following which, the touted update goes and shoots itself through the head. You might say. Robocop ( 7 ) was a witty, vibrant satire of bad action movies. Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie.",0
"Social commentary be damned. It seems that every sci - fi action adventure flick must endure a sad list of follow - up films, and Robocop is a tragic example. It'that simple.",0
"That said, it's not surprising a sequel was made - it's even less surprising that that sequel really pales compared to the original. After a brief glitch in his system, Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with Cain.",0
I really don't understand who this movie is aimed at.,0
"Peter Weller at least had the common sense not to return for the next one. Also the SFX is terrible even for 1990, say hello to bad stop motion. I don't mind a little violence, the first one was incredibly violent but this one is just plain nasty.",0
"< br / > < br / > Look at the first couple of scenes. Frankly, it pretty much sucks. It's not hard to see why. But as far as being a properly shot and executed film, it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos. It has few fans, and most people hate it for it's shameless commercial PG - 13 approach. But RoboCop 2, sir, ain't no such thing. He probably didn't by the way, neither Miller, nor Weller nor Allen did.",0
I was a huge fan of the original Robocop. Part of its character. It makes no sense. So it's bad enough but shame on Leonard Rosenman. < br / > < br / > Caine is a poor villain. < br / > < br / > And finally.,0
"How awful. The Great American Hero? ! But, they completely drop it after that. That is the best part of the film that is consistent with the first. It doesn't work as whole. In beginning we see Robo "" stalking "" his old wife.",0
Even Robert Hardy fans should give this one a wide berth. This movie doesn't.,0
Ernest Saves Christmas'is comedian Ernest's Christmas special film. It's a little bit sad that the film is a little dated now. ',0
That's the good news.,0
"But, if you are into great trash, "" Dragon Hunt "" is made for you. This movie is really awful, but then again, it is a great party tape!",0
But to my surprise I kept watching. This is by far the WORST MOVIE EVER! : ) It's so bad it's good.,0
And I hate chuck Norris. The man has a very cheap paper maché looking hand. There are scene changes at the drop of the hat.,0
"It just goes on and on. I caught Dragon Hunt on TV the other day and it was like a train wreck. Why is it that Canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre, other then action? The movie really has nothing to recommend it. I just could not change the channel, it's sheer stupidity sapped my willpower.",0
"I... < br / > < br / > The acting, if it can even be called that, is rough. Even Anus Magilicutty was better than this, as it was intentionally bad. Thankfully he's pretty much the only example of make - up no - nos in the film. It's that much of a travesty. Yeah, glued to his head. No, it had kitsch value and was technically a well made film.

Poor Miss Austen must be rolling in her grave.,0
I was wondering if I was watching a Playgirl video by mistake. There was a locker room scene involving over a dozen naked men. This film was nothing more than exploitative gay cheesecake. There are several scenes in this film showing penis after penis. Just cut to the chase and rent gay porn instead.,0
"I'm not offended by the sex. It's just repetitive and, before long, boring. Where's the Hays Office when you really need?",0
It was about manipulation. Who cares by this point? A film is the opposite most of the times.,0
"Seeing it now, my opinions have changed. One last thing... a truly repulsive twist ending suggests inces! Worthless. The brutal hammer murder is the opening scene and then it gets worse and worse.",0
"Predictably, Gloria ends up on a meat hook herself. 4 / 10 ... a recommendation!",0
"Having a script that worked might have helped, but this one seems to have been made up on the spot, working from Cliffs Notes. Here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks. When the opening shot is U. S. Marines seriously disrespecting the U. S. flag, a movie has a tough road ahead, but unfortunately it was downhill from there. The U. S. government is still finding the missing from WWII, and it takes months to identify the remains. Either way, this is an awful movie that should have never been made.",0
"Although no film should use Maguire for a voice over, because that belongs to Spiderman. So once more we're handed a loose end here. Now, how satisfying is that.",0
"Actually, some of Carson's montages have been quite entertaining, and the skits occasionally have their moments of decent comedy. The shows only redeeming quality is that it's so short. But, I wouldn't call it crap. < br / > < br / > On to the house band.",0
"The time between Conan and X - Files, on SciFi. He cuts off his guests. I couldn't have been more wrong. < br / > < br / > Zero interview skills. I can only imagine that is the reason it is still on None. Even still, Carson refuses to take the hint from NBC. He talks too much. And the only show on at that time was ( and curiously still is ) Carson Daly. < br / > < br / > He has no comedic timing.",0
I do like the Joe Firstman band. He seems to be a control freak.,0
Altogether an agonizing film that I had to force myself to watch to the end. Surely EVERY woman in Bath didn't have feathers in her headpiece in the early 19th century.,0
That event confirms Carson Daly is awful. He failed hard.,0
< br / > < br / > AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL show. < br / > < br / > It makes my soul cry. Don't watch it.,0
He's not funny! Any 3 year old could have come up with any of the jokes and sketches they put on this lame excuse for a show. What was NBC thinking! The writing is horrible to! The escalator interviews is just stupid and needless to say not funny at all. All of the sketches are painful to watch. Carson Daly has to be the only late night talk show host that isn't a comedian.,0
"It just creeps up on me after Conan. I find it hard just to sit through one of his jokes. < br / > < br / > I have watched the show, never in its entirety, but many times still.",0
I'm surprised it's not an Alan Smithee film. How do movies like this ever get made?,0
"Some of the dialogue she spo & his wife Sara ( Abigail Morgan ). Ha ha ha, only joking!",0

Hell... this should have had suspense, period. Though this isn't as great as I'd hoped, I would go for this over some infomercials. Sara's sexual outbursts got tiring - - fast.",0
Who knows? Was this guy coming back? The plot was so jumpy.,0
But isn't that what most Jess Franco movies are? Shots don't always cut together and the sound mixes can be horrific.,0
She was about the worst I've seen. It did not seem real to me.,0
It was gratingly incongruous. The striped waistcoat and coattails combo he wore was ghastly! It cast an oppressive pall over the entire movie. Saxaphone and electric guitars? Too dark for Austen. It certainly fit his character. The soundtrack was torturously bad. Perhaps I would give the film a 4 then.,0
"Just like Swarm did. < br / > < br / > The sad part is the blatant attempt of the filmmakers to inspire panic. ( Outside of wash your hands, what no duct tape? ) The acting and directing are competent for a TV movie but the script is all over the map. Fatal Contact : Bird Flu in America : 3 out of 10 : This movie is both funny and sad.",0
"This movie was rushed in hopes of being able to gain a few easy dollars. If you have not seen this movie, don't bother. Stay away! What garbage, is there actually no part II? Don't be fooled by hype! I really hope the production of this movie was only a couple of weeks. Movie is full of poorly developed characters and poor acting.",0
"You bet they do - - but that's no excuse for fiddling with reality to such a degree. < br / > < br / > GFT, Amazon Reviewer But there is a problem here. Do gays and lesbians living in rural Mississippi face major, sometimes frightening challenges? It isn't even in the same state. Bay Minette isn't near Tupelo, as the film implies.",0
"In addition, the young man who was murdered isn't even from this town. Instead, the focus is primarily on the outrageous bigotry ( big news! ) < br / > < br / > The whole movie works as a warning rather than a celebration, and it'very suspect.",0

Dead acting.,0

My mom, my cousins, and I are pretty big Jane Austen fans. < br / > < br / > Bad idea! Plus, they're completely affected and unbelievable.",0
"Certainly not an incompetent piece, "" Anywhere But Here "" does have moments that work, but it isn't an embraceable film, nor has it proved to be an important one.",0

Zombie Planet seems like an example of good ideas and laudable ambition overstepping budget. So probably most worth looking for the two of them. The problem was that it was too long and anti - climatic.,0

No sir.,0
Images still haunt me from the film. This didn't for me.,0
"The acting isn't even any good. It's message is good, but I have seen them been handled better in several other films. If you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. make any excuse you can to avoid this film. And if your not happy with my preview, seriously I'm an open minded guy and I like movies that protest through symbolism, but this movie was just awful.",0
This is a polarising film. Deliberately so. Allowing Kafka to concentrate and comment on the absurd / surreal situations and surroundings. America is a surreal story of a youth's travels through the country.,0
It offers nothing and serves no purpose. I'm still trying to get over how bad it was. This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.,0
"It seems like there is a point or a message or something in the film, but what that is remains completely obscure. By now countless significant things are happening without any explanation. At one point one wonders whether the main story in the film is the fate of the moon. It is as if by this point the director has simply given up bothering to put any meaning into the film. < br / > < br / > The effects were fantastic and very well judged. However, it was downhill from here.",0
"The book I didn't like though, but the movie yes. Hope the moon will exist not happen as in the movie.",0
This movie is a disgrace. That was an important part of the story.,0
While all three share the same basic story & ideas this remake adds subplot about Alexander's fiancé Emma being killed & that's the reason he invents a time machine rather than just because he is clever & he can. Alexander decides to stick around & save the Eloi.,0

"Ever. Movie. """,0
"As a hero, his character is a total wimp. In every scene that calls for courage, Pearce gets the short end of the stick. ! The scenes which take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere. Jeremy Irons as the King of the Morlocks is great. The original version of this movie was a lot better in this respect. This new version lacks substance and feeling. He really makes the movie a lot better than it was.",0
< br / > < br / > The general story? Ugh. He just shows up in time to be killed. A total misrepresentation of the novel. The Morlocks are too intelligent. I kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel.,0
Blowing up the Moon to destroy humanity is that made the 1960 version so endearing. The George Pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of'travel'though a 4th dimension.

But the cinematography was good.,0
"Normally BBC productions of Jane Austen are pretty good but Northanger Abbey is just odd. What were they thinking? Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned in one of his few terribly ham "" performances. Not only that, the "" gothic "" sequences are tacky, over - the - top, and frankly silly.",0
"Sorrowfully most indie films that don't make it suffer from just that mentality. It fails for many reasons - bad acting, bad script, no clear point. Simple as that. Saw the film at it's Lawrence, Kansas premiere.",0
Stop.,0
"Or clever? "" 7 on IMDb. I guess Kansas will have to wait.",0
"This is why I don't badmouth most mainstream actors. That sums up the flick in a nutshell. I must give credit where credit's due, though. But without good acting, a film has no redeeming value.",0
"Yet, for some reason, there is not a single scene I ever want to see again. This director is his own man. Very strange.",0
"Unfortunately, this is lame and laboured.",0
"However, they are miscast, because they have the wrong accent. < br / > < br / > Chris Beattie and Greg McLane give good performances in the two young leads.

Since many scenes are set in a school the PE teacher is a sadistic bully and that's the closest the film ever gets to reality. It's a grim stereotypical view of Geordie life and a very unfunny one at that.,0
And funny? '.,0

"In this film they are all stupid, violent, thieving, thugs.",0
"Nicely shot, not very well acted and ultimately fails on three crucial points : script, script, script. Quite simply, he comes up incredibly short here.",0
In fact it's quite the opposite. I found it even boring at times due to it's extreme predictability. If you also pay for it you should get serious brainscan done. But this has got to be the worst I've seen. < br / > < br / > It's not even funny.,0

"It was all passable. And HOTD 2 was... better? The script, even though subpar, was better than the first one. Instead, they have to get a sample of zombie blood, so they can create a cure to the deadly virus. The Resident Evil was alright, but its sequels are pure rubbish.",0

Where to begin? I bought the DVD to get Julia Ormond. Perhaps Julia's acting skills were great enough to carry off that impression.

The animation is not great quality, the actors have wasted their voices for a worthless piece of garbage. This was only the second version of the classic story by Charles Dickens I had seen, and sadly it turned out to be one of the worst.",0
That was the worst. Why did my eyes have to see?,0
"You do get the feeling that this wasn't marketed for a 1949 mainstream British audience. That's entertainment, the reason people go to cinemas. It didn't matter what the plot was or who was in it, if it was an American movie people would want to see it and if it was British people wouldn't want to see it. And they use words like "" Austere "". And the protagonists drink cocktails. < br / > < br / > Watching THE ATSONISHED HEART in 2005 I was astonished how dated everything was, in fact it's so dated I thought maybe it might be a spoof from THE HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW.",0
"It is her performance that saves this film from abject dullness. He should never have been allowed in front of a camera. I like Noel Coward, the wit. I like Noel Coward, the play write. With lovely films like these I suppose we can forgive him for this turkey.",0
The title is from a passage in the Bible ( Deut. ! The other reviewers cover the plot details so I wont rehash. I wanted to reach through the screen and throttle not just the adulterer but the dim - wit wife. Its interesting that Michael Redgrave was originally cast What's even more implausible is how the betrayed wife responds when she learns of the infidelity. He is saying this at the podium at the exact moment as he lays eyes on Leonora Vail in the audience - the woman who will become his mistress. Not very subtle for showing that this is indeed what will happen to this poor man. < br / > < br / > I think the whole premise of the movie is implausible and just didn't work. He and Leonora have absolutely no chemistry on screen whatsoever. 28 : 28 ).,0
"Furthermore, I found Chris and Leonora's relationship somewhat unconvincing. Coward's character was too austere and cynical to be the object of Leonora's affections. Oddly, there are many perfect opportunities in the story for conflict, and yet none of them are utilised. Taken at face value it's not a bad film, but there's nothing terribly good about it either.",0
Of course all of Woman are in tight fitting tops and tons of make up to make up for their lack of talent.,0
The movie plays like a rejected NYU student film.,0
Just leave it alone.,0
Not highly recommended.,0
"She was a Ford model and it shows. I just get the feeling that this girl truly believed this was gonna be her big break or something, instead of the near career killer that it was. When she sings her first song she really does act like she thinks she's flippin'Julie Andrews or something. Almost impossible to believe this is the same girl - but it is. So what the hell is she doing in this cheap, cheesy skin flick? It is also definitely not a body double at all.",0
"Screen writing 101 ). Ugh! Her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments just look at her when she draws an X in the air while stalked by the killer. Will Hollywood ever learn? OK, so he turns out to be a real cop. And, yes, in fact the movie turned out to be a comedy, albeit an unintentional one.",0

The police send a notorious gangster and cop killer ( along with a number of other prisoners ) on a bus with a grand total of two guards. Also, no one near the precinct happens to hear or see this major siege going on with flash grenades and heavy rifle fire going off? Right.

"Why "" assault "" the place at all? How could they possibly miss so badly so often? It's all just FUBAR. If veteran cop was in on it from the start, why the need for this whole movie? They want EVERYONE dead. How about those police snipers?",0
Simply awful.,0
The opening scene keeps me from rating at absolute zero. Based on stupidity I guess.,0
"NOT USING IT. There is the initial probe, then the laying of the siege, then the assault, then escape attempts.

"It does translate into a certain kind of laziness on a filmmaker's part - you have a stupidly large union crew, a studio and a marketing firm all doing your thinking for you. Los Angeles, 1976.

"Just wrong. The acting is bad. Even in a comedy, there is supposed to be some seriousness. The humor is disgusting and goes way too far. It lacks structure, consistency and taste.",0
"A wiser course of action would have been to stay with the teasing supernatural angle. In early scenes, Mr. Lugosi ( as Monsieur Colomb ) is effectively creepy. Black Dragons "" is an incredible, wildly inconsistent muddle.",0
"I'm sorry but I have to respectfully disagree with this opinion. By the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which I won't reveal here. It is "" classic "" only in that it is old, not in any sense pertaining to its quality.",0
"If not, you won't care. Fifth - oh, what's the use? They didn't have to predict the bombing.",0
AWFU picture!,0
"They looked absolutely NOTHING like Japanese men. Or, it could just behoddy production values and editing. Bela Lugosi is a real enigma. The bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull.",0

"There are comments like, "" A true patriot would do this or that. "" Just another day at work. A police force that doesn't know what is going on. Poor Bela Lugosi. There are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero. I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.",0
I wasn't sure where this was headed until the ending. What a load of right - wing crud!,0
OK. Continue with this movie and you are off to cloud coocoo land. Silly me.,0
"There could be some SPOILERS AHEAD but I doubt it. It wasn't. Whoever that person was, he or she should have been employed to rewrite this script. I've seen bits of "" Run Lola Run. "" I have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the shredder. It's horrible.",0

The kids are woefully unconvincing also.,0
"The characters in this film were just so over the top and unbelievable. Not to mention Malicai's over dramatic stick up his butt character. Like I said, for a good laugh, watch it, but I'm warning you, it's pretty pathetic.",0

"Isaac, Malachai and all the other "" Children of the Corn "" aren't really all that scary.",0

"If this plot is attractive to you, knock yourself out. I found the characters tiresome and the satire is old hat.",0
This thing is trash... and not in a fun way. That's how bad this movie is. Not a second of tension can be found. Where to start? I am not. It's been done before and a lot better.,0
"Been there, done that in just too many films. < br / > < br / > Wow. And, to do so, he's brought in hired guns to force people to sell or kill them.",0
"He does nothing with it. It's not a bad idea, but Cabot does not have the acting chops for it. The main problem that causes is that the acting is really, really bad. When sea faring Sterling Haden's pop is killed, how will Haden put an end to TERROR IN A Texas TOWN, armed only with a harpoon?",0

I really wish I had simply read my Sheldon Van Auken instead. I was totally the wrong audience.",0
Scenes dragged on far too long and points were ultimately beaten to death. It just left me empty despite what was trying to be said. I really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3.,0
"He wouldn't. Julien Hernandez is certainly an attractive and likable on screen persona. In fact, his character pretty much carries this whole film, or what's worthwhile about it.",0
"A perfect example of wasted footage is the fast forwarding montage in the first third of the movie. This is the type of plot that Sex In The City could handle in a half hour episode, so there was no reason for it to be even an 88 minute movie.",0
"As far as Demme goes, this is the daring director of Something Wild & Melvin And Howard? I walked into Heart Of Gold thinking I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young. What happened to the raunchy guitar of his earlier solo efforts?",0

"I give this one half star out of a possible ten. It's not even campy, just really bad.",0
"I didn't even see any bananas for a wedding gift. Oh, right he wasn t cursed yet. This movie was cheesy and it was more than that.",0
"Therefore, the film feels understandably rushed and disjointed if never less than campily enjoyable as it culminates in the gorilla's subjectively - shot chasing of Payton in the jungle, with the former being itself pursued by the gun - toting Chaney and Conway. Consequently, Burr takes to losing himself in the jungle for days on end even if the ape creature itself is barely glimpsed throughout the film.

"And the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true. < br / > < br / > But Jade has none of this. There was absolutely nothing in this that I found interesting at all.

It's just handles about a plantation manager who's jealous at his older colleague for having such a beautiful young wife and he kills him. fail miserably and it causes way too much talking and too few jungle - action.,0
It did not take me more than 5 minutes to figure that out. < br / > < br / > You've got to give the film - maker something though.,0
There was no incident or anything to make me buy into this. The plot as a whole isn't the worst. It's filmed a lot inside a building rather than a friend's basement. SPOILER ALERT!!!,0

My 3 - year - old cousin couldn't make a worse film. I wish I had never seen this movie.,0
The camera then pans across to reveal the actor we have just seen drive away. Comedy is more than things just falling over and everyone talking ( or shouting ) at once. This movie has one or two slightly interesting gags but they are NOT worth the wait.,0
"How did this awful film find any kind of distro? After seeing this, I'm really insulted by that.",0
"On 16mm film, however, it's awful. On paper.",0
Skip it. The rest of the movie is just tedious hard to watch filler. It could be considered a mercy. A friend of mine took the tape from an overflowing St. Vincent DePaul clothes bin. Basically the'money'scenes involving the bike actually doing stuff are few and lame and the rest is clunky filler material. Comedy of the sub Benny Hill horny old man can't stop staring at the female leads chest variety.,0

Knowing this, we spend the first hour of film in fearful expectation, wondering just what form that disaster will take when it does finally arrive.

They could not provide basic things to us when we were kids. I find this movie very resentful. I was made to work on streets along with my siblings. I am a victim of that. com Its very partial. It is highly partial towards parents.,0
This proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing Police drama to an average type of television soap. When i watch it i feel like I'm watching a police version of Coronation Street or something similar. I want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over.,0
It must have been slow year!,0
Then of course the many holes in the plot throughout. This may not be the worst movie to ever win best picture but its up there. That in fact though if questionable as well. This movie was consistently annoying and frustrating. Still though you would expect it to be a worth while film.,0
"But if you're an "" old - fashioned "" type, then don't bother.",0

"Anne Heche deserves special Hall of Shame recognition for her awkward portrayal of a scientist. She is about as convincing in this role as Pee Wee Herman, and even he would have at least done a better acting job. Although he makes a decent effort, the script is just so pathetic even he goes down in flames ( oops, sorry about that ). Most of the supporting cast is also choked by the hackneyed writing ; a few of the actors simply phone in their roles. The loser could be forced to listen to tapes of corny lines from movie like "" Everybody looks the same "" over and over. Riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. < br / > < br / > For fans of cheese and silliness only. This was Tommy Lee Jones's turn.

But what a damp squib.,0
I was wrong.,0
Isn't that by far passing good taste standards?,0
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie. The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles.,0
"& it constantly happens, helicopters flying is clouds of ash ( in reality it would be impossible ), one simple blockade at the end of a street will stop the flowing lava ( what about down the other streets & other directions?",0
It is amazing that films like this get commissioned. The acting makes Arnie look like a RSC thespian. It certainly made me laugh.,0
"Avoid this movie at all costs. Yea right. In this one, he is heading the emergency office.",0
I mean the acting is actually very good. You can't stand next to lava. The effects are above average. Look away and spend your time on more meaningful content. This movie is a disaster within a disaster film. Scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie.,0

"Don Cheadle gets to sit in a really coooool office and take Jones's phone calls, doing the job that in reality Roark would and should be doing. Gaby Hoffman goes from Field of Dreams and American President to a turn as a whimpering, needy, and victim - for - life daughter of Jones. Volcano'is a B - movie at best, and at worst is more of a disaster that what it's supposed to be depicting. Besides, K - rails are hardly watertight, but I guess lava wouldn't think to poke its head through the gaps, not when Tommy Lee Jones is glaring at it.

"It is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit. No light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in "" The United States of Depression. "" An excellent cast was wasted, especially in the earnest performance of Christina Ricci. The real - life Elizabeth Wurtzel obviously found within herself the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author. < br / > < br / > This film reminded me of a generic made - for - cable "" victim "" film on the Lifetime network. The film examines divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol, and prescription medication as possible reasons for Liz's unhappiness.

"< br / > < br / > Also, this is pedantic, but Wurtzel did not lose her virginity to Noah. Read'More, Now, Again'( by the same author ) instead.

"Unfortunately I think Lange peaked with Frances and it was all downhill from there. go on lizzie, sue!",0

This is a major problem. < br / > < br / > Unfortunately do to the flashback construction, Lizzy merely comes off as certainly more affected teenager than most, but not nearly as devastatingly ill as she comes off in the book. Congratulations to Christina Ricci for making this movie and putting her mojo behind this important subject and trying to make a great film. She is so talented, and such a vulnerable and disaffected spirit so early on, that one's heart can't help but reach out to her due to her victimization.",0
"Pure class. Lange apparently can not be brought down by terrible script, directing and dire co - actors.",0

Mena Suvari was delightfully repellent. < br / > < br / > Romantic? Hardly. Don Cheadle is sincere and magnetic - I always want to see more of him on screen. I didn't develop any connection with this character.,0
Out of the gate the dialogue was UNBEARABLE. 'Little did I know. Truly awful.,0
"Plus, it just isn't very good stuff as well. But, just at that moment, the army turns up and kills the traitor.... bummer. A strange banker, also is thrown into the mix. This clearly isn't the work of Ennio Morricone - - music master of the Spaghetti genre.",0
"Secondly, few women professors are sleeping with dorm cooks.",0

So annoyed I even complained to Blockbuster for stocking it.,0
Even with these scenes added it was very short.,0
"Over the course of the movie these three characters form shifting alliances in an attempt to get the money. This movie had all the elements of a decent western : a good story with talented actors and everything else. Lately, I've been watching a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present. These scenes practically derail the main story.",0

"Thanks Gus Van Sant... not. this is slow, plot less and boring. big waste of time and money.",0
"< br / > < br / > From there, the movie is about 50 per cent slow motion. A gratuitous slow motion shot of * nothing happening. Get back to work and think of something to say. Here's a guy sitting. It seemed to be there to test the limits of the audience's patience.",0
How any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me. These actors are horrible. I made an account on IMDb just to comment on this cr @ p film.,0

The writers lacked any imagination. But maybe I won't.,0
"Okay, when I was around 11 years old, I witnessed the masterpiece Rosemary's Baby and then read book sequel. The coven is now called the tribe ( as I said earlier ). In fact, it's a pretty poor film in general.",0
"However, when compared to this mess it looks a whole heck of a lot better. The first film is somewhat good to me, I enjoyed it for the most part, but I thought it was really nothing all that special. I do have to say it was a sequel that should have never seen light of day.",0
He's very off - kilter and looks really sinister without even doing anything. Gordon's the sole holdover from the original. Newcomer McHattie is the film's only real saving grace.,0
"He hides them in a bucket of "" two for a dollar "" items, and then runs from scene. I honestly don't know where to begin when reviewing a movie as pathetic as Ernest Goes to Africa. < br / > < br / > The first thing that really hit me about this movie is how bad the acting is.",0

"Watch out, it might put you in a deep trance! Also on show are some nice moments of blood and gore, but not overtly grand or distinguishable from most other films. What catches your eye is the faded colour scheme, but sometimes the actual screen would look real grainy, or snowy.

This movie starts out as if it were a comedy. I give this film 1 / 10.,0
"Cock it up in the opening shot and you are dead. Just one locked off camera ). Julie Corman said "" I've seen enough. "" Ten seconds. and left the room. Aha! Two men meet.

There is no story...!,0

unfortunately i waited until the end in my case.,0
"Vice and Angels Die Hard. Where's the piranha? Caribe now hunts humans, I guess. Anybody wanna race on motorcycles? Caution : film contains extreme dry look. Will you care? My advice is to rent a Jack Palance classic like Craze.",0

No redeeming factors at all. BORING!!! NO this film! Easily the worst movie of all time.,0

WARNING : I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment. They only show piranhas ONCE! I wish I wouldn't have. < br / > < br / > If you plan on watching this movie DON'T!,0
"Piranha "" is a case where less would have been more. Two wildlife photographers are traveling through the Amazon River basin on their latest assignment. And, there is far too much superfluous footage on display. "" An attraction between Brown Ms. Capri could have been played up, also. "" After they hook up with hunky big - game hunter William Smith ( as Caribe ), psychological dramatics surface.",0
There is no definite storyline. 00 on the DVD. Nice scenery.,0
There were lots of monkeys.,0

"Caribe Caribe ""! Terry is terrified of guns as we learn that as a young girl saw her father get his head blown off by a gun. What you do see is a travelogue of Venezuela and it's people and the Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon River basin. Instead you have to wait until the movie is almost over for you to get as much as a glimpse of the Piranahs.",0
"There were a few others. But there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to. There are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes. This movie was outright painful for me to watch. I don't mean to sound like a harsh critic who doesn't know a thing. I have been unable to discover this method used in this film. Secondly, the dialog. First off, jump cuts.",0
Just a sprawling mess. I caught this during a brief run in a Philadelphia theater.,0
"Forget about the dead models, we have a magazine to produce! No. So absurd. This movie just happened to be on HBO yesterday so I watched it.",0
"So you've got a number of models on an island, and one by one they're picked off Agatha Christie - style. The photographer is rather bad at framing! Nothing terribly graphic.",0

"But if you're a horror fan ( like me ) you'll probably be bored silly. I give it 3. Also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring. And, shown out of context, these bits aren't very scary at all. 00 for an 84 minute movie!",0
"Interest cinematography, great actors don't MAKE a film ; the story does.",0
What were they thinking? No cliche goes unexploited in this jaw - dropping bad movie.,0
The Disney Channel presents a lot of original TV - movies and most of them are better than this.,0
i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year. the movie was really predictable.,0
"It is more thrilling to show that bomb ticking. Such an affair is very rare in The Netherlands. I do. Any smart person can guess what it is. Go see Hard Candy. A nice twist now and then also helps. Five Fingers is so bad, that I hardly know where to begin.",0
The Dutch survivor is forced to play chess with a Morpheus - like Arab guy for so long that you'll learn how to play chess too! < br / > < br / > The movie is divided into two parts. The movie happens in a room supposed to be in Morocco but actually in some American city! DAMN!,0
Torture in and of itself is gruesome. This is a little bit of a twist of the normal Hollywood manipulation of time.,0
"Phillipe's accent btw, being far from anything near Dutch, sounded more like Eastern European. Why give the guy a wash if he's in for a torture? It made it being served like French fries at a drive - in and caused the build - up of suspense to flatline. Didn't make sense < br / > < br / > * * * * * * * * * Scenery aside, The way these flashbacks pushed plot didn't work for me at all. In fact, Five Fingers never gets anywhere near its level.",0
They have their own agenda!,0

Ray is lame. SHUT UP! ).,0
"Oh and yep.... they do full meals too. Add "" DE - LISH "" to my list of stupid tag words.",0
And have nothing more to do with anybody who loved it - they don't have a clue. Do not see this film.,0
"And, once finished, she bega putting on dancing performances for practically no one. < br / > < br / > What you think about this documentary depends on your perspectives.",0
"But no... though to be fair, having an all new cast is in keeping with the original comic ( in which the Mask went from owner to owner ). If only.",0

"Son of the Mask "" is a terrible excuse of a movie. 1 star out of 10 is generous to this awful mess.",0
Why was this sequel made?? That's it. Son of the Mask is a terrible movie. Actually that is just an insult to rehashes.,0
Then there'the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays. One day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life. I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash. Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap.,0
"! If you really MUST see this movie rent it when it comes out, don't go to the movies for this!",0
He's such a good actor that I cringed every time he spoke in this film. I actually was looking forward to this movie.,0
"I'm trying to keep calm, or IMDb probably won't let me post this. There was no need for this movie, plain and simple. Why is this man still allowed to breathe? So why make a sequel / prequel thing? HOW DID SOMEONE THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA? Bottom line : don't watch this piece of trash. The writing and story : terrible. But then they just make mistake after mistake. Don't waste even a second of your time on. ! Jamie Kennedy. The acting is despicable, in fact nearly everything about this movie is.",0
"The baby peing on his dad just lame! Uggg!!!!!!!!!!!! I Hate this Trash!! Probably just as stupid as "" Son of the Mask "". "" ! It's a really HORRIBLE and AWFUL movie!",0
WRONG!!!!!!!!!! !,0
Just one - tenth of the amount of money spent on Son of the Mask. etc. The producers should truly be ashamed of themselves. That's right.,0
"Like the nose woman. I've seen a lot of movies. Too bad this movie is horrible. This, basically is not. It all ends happy. There is also an Exorcist parody. Tim's wearing the mask.",0
Fu * kingh * t! This should be in'crappest films of sh * t in earth '. This is very crap so i'll give it a 1 out of 10. I cant believe it!,0
"Because if they did, they were completely out of their minds.",0
This movie should average at 1. Truly sad.,0
At least I was able to sit through this. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role. The CGI is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie.,0
"At some times, it is even laughable. I sort of liked this movie, not a good one, but not the worst ever made. The voice is HORRIBLE. It is a nice movie to watch if you have nothing else to watch, though. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor in here. There are a lot of immature jokes.",0
What a waste of time for everyone who watches this trash.,0
"! Give us the good stuff and send the rest to the DVD shelves, cause we are taking back the theaters once and for all!!",0
"Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this? Why? After the party Tim goes home, mask still on and conceives a child with his wife. Everyone knew how to spell party.

"< br / > < br / > I own the DVD of the original Mask, and quite enjoyed it. His exact words ; "" I hated it. They take something good and have to put all that gross stuff in.

"" Let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!",0
A comedy?,0
Simply awful. of craftspeople spent so much time working on what the writers and producers MUST have known would be a colossal failure. It's embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars went into this film and that hundreds ( thousands? ) This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen.,0
"Mr. Kennedy should stop ExPeRiMeNtIng with bad movie scripts. Kinda describes how I felt when this movie ended! ) ( Hey, I said "" hit and run ""! What WAS he thinking? If there was a ZERO rating, I'd give it, but I guess I'll settle for a generous 1.",0
Mask mode? A load of crap!! This film has made e mad. Thank you.,0
"Oh yeah, the graffiti sucks too. This movie is a gay love story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship.",0
"I want more from a film than this. Something happened. No dialog, just tagging and shoplifting.",0
The final twist is at best laughable. major turkey.,0
"And it is badly made. For me 3 out of 10. Sounds over familiar, doesn't it. Both titles are misleading, though.",0
"Wasting time! I don't mind a low budget.. Please go for some others. awful,, just awful. Even the Graffito, not artistic.",0
"No plot. 3. I understand it got into the Panorama section, but still. Horrible acting.",0
Then comes the unnecessary gay love scene.,0

"First off, I am a huge fan of Tolkien, and as one I will base most of my critic on his books.",0
"Great chunks of what makes The Lord Of The Rings what it is, is simply ignored. Even 2001 special effects can't do Tolkien's ( and your own ) imagination justice. Why? Thus for me the movie was a disappointment. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the character - gallery.",0

"In my opinion, this movie is not good. The story takes place on a cruise ship. Family fun?",0
No actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing. It was REALLY that bad. < br / > < br / > I must admit that there were a couple of chuckles. It isn't tipped or anything. It was.,0
"Crosby : You mean they missed my song? < br / > < br / > The movie wasn't what I expected. I was expecting waaaaay better. < br / > < br / > I didn't like the movie. There was only about 4 instances of that. I was expecting more "" Road, "" but there isn't much.",0
When played for laughs storyline works.,0
< br / > < br / > This movie is a wet dream for art film haters. This movie is Sokurov.,0
The song was totally stupid... Eddie Fischer was simply bad.,0
"His acting is completely bland and clueless. < br / > < br / > In Bundle of Joy Debbie Reynolds is her usual perky self. In Bachelor Mother, he is priceless as the desperate grandfather wannabe. This film is strictly for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. It is a 1930's wink at the Hays Office. Here he is way too wholesome for this story.",0
"His mistress, who if I understood correctly is also his cousin (? The Italians are undeniable masters in the questionable "" art "" of ripping off and imitating movies.",0
It is absolute torture to sit through this drive.,0
The film has got a big problem : it does not scare. I would not call The Messengers as a bad movie...,0
"Some scenes sea random. Waste of time, and money. Actor play is very poor.",0
Why did the father come back again? All the scary scenes were shown in the previews.,0
No pun intended. The creepy crawly boy... The Grudge did it and did it better.,0
"And what was with the black and white at the beginning? At least I was entertained. This movie was trying to something, but failed miserably. He just waltzes in from no where in a vast field. Makes no sense. Rent for entertainment not quality.",0
Of course her parents and the police are skeptical. 4 out of 10.,0
"I cannot believe I actually went to the theatres to see this! Then some more happens, the drifter guy goes nuts and the movie ends. Dumb stupid crap.",0
"The walls creak. The real horror in THE MESSENGERS is waiting for which horror movie it will savage next. Thinking she's some teenage girl who cried wolf, her parents don't believe her. Avoid it.",0
"Otherwise, watch it once, vomit, shower and never speak of it to anyone. On purpose?",0
"No matter what movie it is you are seeing, the theatre will always be packed by people who have been awaiting the film, like free stuff, thought it'd be something to do, or just got lost. Special sneak previews are always a good time. Either way, no matter how good or bad the film, the audience alone will make it enjoyable. Now when said movie is a PG - 13 pseudo - horror film ( can you really delve into horror when the MPAA is on your back censoring everything? ) you know there will be chatter, laughing, and breath holding. A family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try and rebuild their relationship with each other. < br / > < br / > The story is a common one.",0
"That's like killing two birds with one stone ; way to go guys! "" moments. Restless spirits of the previous inhabitants trapped in the walls of a remote countryside farm?",0
"Clue # 1 for all considering seeing this turkey : Sam Raimi didn't direct it. Didn't anyone think to maybe arrest him? It simply isn't there. In fact, everyone can see the ghosts. The teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them, even quite early in the movie. The whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the "" surprise ending "" long before it comes. All of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted.",0
The story concludes with disappointment. I cared about the story. This is best suited as a movie to rent. It does. The acting was decent.,0
"And just as a movie in general, is a big disappointment. Oh, and the first five minutes of the movie show something really horrible happened there.",0
"Wow, scary! I thought, for sure, that the old man was a ghost. < br / > < br / > The movie was so predictable. Because he's a man, duh! Yup, I was right. Nope, just a crappy movie.",0
"She was okay at acting scared and that's it. It was full of silly sequences and bland dialog. Also, I didn't like the close - ups of the actors.",0
( I'm glad they're not my parents! ) Alfred Hitchcock would be spinning in his grave. A good movie has at its roots an INTERESTING story! ).,0
"After his family is killed, the boy attempts to run and hide only to be snatched away as well. The opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film. < br / > < br / > Now, about the film.",0
"Just saw this movie on opening night. I must say, I was not impressed.",0
"And it certainly was memorable. And yes, they had Tomb Raider. Absolutely nothing in this movie amused me even slightly.",0
"Good old Jess Franco! And it wasn't even the first time, since the duo previously already made "" Linda "" together. Anyways, just in case you wondered : YES, "" Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro "" does have a plot, albeit a very imbecilic one. Jess once again really surpassed himself with this utterly trashy piece of jungle "" adventure "". This could have been a compelling and action - packed adventure movie, but Jess Franco obviously couldn't be bothered. I say vegetarian because they never at one point in the film so much even attempt to consume human flesh.",0
"< br / > < br / > Where the director does succeed, however, is in his casting of sexy young Katja Bienert as jungle jail - bait Diana.",0
"This film is often mentioned in the same vein as the classic Italian cannibal movies. < br / > < br / > Gore? Jess Franco makes exploitation films, and he has made tons of them. The acting is horrid, and the editing is confusing. The plot is paper thin, placing a nubile young girl in the jungle among cannibals. This film fails on most of those benchmarks. The sets are laughable. We really don't get information on why she and her father were there in the first place. What else is there?",0
It is certainly no gorefest.,0
"But overall this picture sizes up as barely watchable and hence instantly forgettable swill. The beautiful jungle scenery is very nice, too.",0
I really couldn't care what happened to any of the characters in this film - they were all so 2 dimensional. Terribly disappointed with CITY OF MEN after being swept away by CITY OF GOD. Boo!,0

"< br / > < br / > however, it never delivers. the plot is simply too illogical. don't waste your time on "" puckoon "".",0
"I certainly couldn't. Turns out she's a doctor and they have a whirlwind courtship and get married. She liked working with Henry Fonda right enough, but thought this film was ridiculous. As well she should have. In fact feminists would probably be aghast at it. And he's not understanding as to her professional obligations.",0
"The Exorcist "". < br / > < br / > Almost. Some, a handful.",0
It is.,0
"Blair is continually pawed at, punched, raped, humiliated and harassed.",0
"Viewing, the film now, though, makes me look at Stella Stevens character more closely. I honestly feel guilty laughing at this film considering it had to be career lows for all involved. Hmmm. As much of a Linda Blair fan I am, top ( or topless ) honors go to Sybil Danning.",0
Get the CD instead. Not worth the tape it's recorded on.,0
This film is ridiculous! They would not condemn her.,0
BORING.,0
"I didn't have much luck. Often, such cheap Hollywood back - lot productions use a combination of legit and porn actors. LORD PROTECTOR is kiddie fare, but for whose kids?",0
"< br / > < br / > Life, what a trip!",0
"Now, that's funny. < br / > < br / > The gentle pacing is a killer as well. Farce should accelerate towards the end. Ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film.",0
! I guess big producers make whatever they want.,0
"It is fair to recognize it. Please, be serious!",0
"Still, if you look past these there is some suspense and acting jewels.",0
I can't believe they even released such a movie.,0
"That'll throw the audience for a loop! "" What an original idea.",0
"And it was done by the supposedly smarter characters no less. Wow, did this film stink or what? At that moment I thought "" Well if he likes it then I gotta like it! "" Hello? Didn't feel it. Where do I begin with why it did so? The characters I hated a lot and from the beginning I could tell who would die and who wouldn't.",0
The only good thing of this movie is its final twist.,0
"Would have been better if it's written in Spanish. And don't get me started with the inside jokes and punchlines. First few minutes in the movie and you'll know what will happen next. The movie is nothing extraordinary. In fact, it makes it worse. As a matter of fact, it is an insult to the horror genre.",0
script. Too bad.,0
"And what makes this nun so mean and nasty ( and wet? ) Yeah whatever. For someone that did Darkness, the Nameless, Devil's Backbone, this is a pretty lame film.",0
"Why she is even there is beyond me - - I assume it's just to whine and yell. At the same time, she's NOT an integral part of the film but received top billing. As a result, I found the movie practically unwatchable and it was completely ruined. Why?",0
"Stay away from this garbage. I'm sure glad I rented it and didn't buy it, or I'd be furious beyond belief.",0
"Review : Nunsploitation films. Still, with all that mental preparation I was disappointed. Thats it. They've been around since forever. The movie has some nice cinematography. Need a reminder of the kind of movies that this company churns out? < br / > < br / > This movie was produced by Brian Yuznas Fantastic Factory. In this school there's a Nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls.",0
I'm also confused as to whether or not it's in English.,0
It turned out to be a teen slasher. It'like a horror parody in some points. Well I was totally wrong. They certainly faked it pretty well though.,0
I must admit that I was quite disappointed because the trailer promised so much more. < br / > < br / > But all is not bad. The final thirty minutes consists of some killings and a lot of running around in an abandoned convent. We even get some nice killings too! The major flaw in this Spanish slasher / shocker is within it's script. Real screen presence! It should have been so much better ( although the final scenes in the flooded room is quite okay )! ).,0
"The acting in this film are below average all around. In this movie, I will make an exception. Is all Spanish horror films this disappointing?",0
"What gives? < br / > < br / > The acting's pretty forgettable, with the cast speaking in perfect heavily accented English. heroine to uncover the truth and save the day. However, there are plot holes abound, so don't be looking into the storyline too deeply.",0
This is a stereotype plot. The fights are also shot poorly. Cheesy music and awkward moments are not what I call entertainment. The coach yells do this and do that with no success.,0
"It's a sad loss for one who loves a good sea story. Also, it would have been very simple to make.",0
"Regrettably, it seems that the bad luck of main character has rubbed off on picture in the worst possible way. I attended a screening of'The Cooler'at the Toronto Film Festival this year. Macy wisely ducked out the side door and didn't even stick around for the screening. I hope for their sakes they can all avoid similar humiliations in the future. Kramer couldn't have been crueler to these actors if he had himself taken a steel pipe to their knees.",0
"The cloyingly clever animals? Let me count the ways it is bad. The asinine script? That would just about cover everyone involved in its unfortunate production. If you have seen it already my condolences. The dizzy plot? I hope so. Yet were I to detail its merits, this space would remain blank. I might even find something worthwhile to watch in its stead.",0
Lazenby is too big and innocent looking to play Bond. The best portrayed characters of the movie are those of Tracy and her father. This movie is too long ( 140 mins. ),0
"Plus, her husband doesn't notice when $ 30, 000 goes missing from their bank accounts. Far fetched on all counts. A woman in love with her husband ( he's suicidal ) decides to have a baby to save his life.",0
I'll rate this mess one point out of 10. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story about the Emperor's New Clothes.,0
"( Not your fault, Cameron. Would you like to go to dinner? )",0
"Don't expect anything from this movie. The sound!! Zoomed in shots, that gives you no overview of the games.",0
"Yeah whatever. He needs to reinvent himself, showing how he can act without yelling. He even throws Cameron Diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons.",0
Shame on Al Pacino for doing this crap. And this one does. The acting was over the top. The script was just a joke. It just became a bad MTV video. Cameron Diaz?,0
"< br / > < br / > Though from the technical viewpoint, I dislike this film as I only watched upon discovering James Doohan's role. Though plot is good, elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured.",0

"It is like the precious silk of a tailor. So, a sad experience. In film is only Superman. A film who must impressive. Politicall shadows. Jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical America.",0

"And the dialog? So, how did this movie end up so poor?!?! !",0
"Surely firemen do other things, such as getting cats out of trees?",0
"LOVED it. The only real impact comes from the impressive firefighting sequences, and Hans Zimmer's majestic score, which remains one of my all - time favourites.",0
"Stephen "" Bull "" McCaffrey, the elder brother, is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights. Donald "" Shadow "" Rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession. < br / > < br / > The movie tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters, two brothers. 6 rating is beyond me.",0
It's the old class system that destroys English films. It is pathetic.,0
Failing normally.,0

The sound editing was horrible. I had to work the volume control the entire movie.,0
"Three blokes sit around a table talking and what - not. < br / > < br / > But that's what the film is, it's trash ; it's very brave and shameless trash but trash none - the - less.

The hero can't play. And scenes are not following themselves. Is that martial arts? Where? Nothing else. This movie is really bad.,0
I rented this film having heard nothing about it. I wasn't.,0
Well I watch tons of movies and this one really sucked... BIG TIME. !,0
The plot is simple : an American couple is in vacation in Thailand. The script is boring and the actors aren't too talented. And now the horror begins. This is OK till now. The girl's partner is left to search for her.,0
"Which brings me to my next point, which is that this seems a lot like Blade Lite. What we don't have is the budget and talent. This film could just as easily have been set in Los Angeles. Now that's a major drawback when that's the major thrust of the plot.",0
There's a good story well hidden and never really used! What is left is muddled and superficial.,0
"Oh, and did I mention the wardrobe?",0
"This is just forgettable. Attractive, but not believable. Because it doesn't even aspire to be a good vampire movie, VTT fails to deliver any punch that it may have been attempting to. Added to that, when she tells Connor he's "" a young soul, "" she doesn't deliver the line with much of the weight you would expect from an "" old "" soul. It's a cheap way to play your audience, folks.",0
Sylvester the cat stowaway upon a ship that Tweety bird happens to be on with his owner Granny.,0
My vote is four.,0
"Most American remakes of European films are pretty poor, but this is in a league of its own. Will the real George Sluizer please stand up? In fact this might even be the worst ( Sandra Bullock ) movie ever made.",0
"Here the ending is happy which seems forced and unbelievable, and completely wrecks the story. George Sluizer's remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time. Why was it even attempted?",0
DUH! This movie was so poorly acted. The script was lame.,0
They obviously did. < br / > < br / > Total Tosh.,0
I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. The plot is predictable. I can't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb. The dialog is cheesy.,0
I have seen in the last years.,0
"It's riddled with further annoyances and another blinding continuity blunder. Jeff Bridges'robot accent is another example. < br / > < br / > OK here we go. A couple are split apart during a vacation. Horah for that, but it really doesn't take much doing. The climactic sequence itself has essentially been done before only much, much better. What is that for? Starman is back and it seems after a decade on the planet, he's turned nasty.",0
The ending leaves you speechless in your chair.... The suspense is very well built - up.,0
'Tweety's S. O.,0
"Come on! Yet we are forced to buy into this nonsense. Many screenwriters are brilliant, inspired artists. Man, what an awful film. But the explanation itself lacks even the most elementary sense of logic. Personally, I find this completely insulting to even the dimmest of audience members.",0
Cry for the murdered children! < br / > < br / > If only I could give this a zero.,0
"I give this a 2 out of 10. I know about how good the original is supposed to be, it had better be better then this one.",0
* spoiler alert!,0
"What where they thinking? Really, avoid this and GET THE ORIGINAL.",0
"The script is particularly weak. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the His career never recovered from this disastrous misstep. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying "" Please. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Me.",0
That is a great film. This is a horrific mess.,0
Am still trying to figure out what the movie was all about and why there were no outdoor shootings. Total waste of time and money. I seriously fell asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either.,0
"However, DARK WORLD is just the latest in a string of disappointments. The first 90 minutes are very hard to watch. Well, for those audience members whose only other movie experiences are TV : THE MOVIE and SURFER, DUDE ; they might be bamboozled into nodding their heads in agreement. Once upon a time Theresa Russell made a few halfway decent movies, so I keep hoping that one of her efforts from the past decade or two will merit a rating of at least 6 or 7 ( out of 10 ). ).",0
I happened to catch this movie on late night TV. The script also felt very contrived. Well I was very wrong.,0
"Money can't buy everything, but it should in Hollywood! Now it sounds like Shutter Island is doing that. All it told me was "" low budget. "" This movie was bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. < br / > < br / > PS My 2 star rating is for Russell and Pare.",0
< br / > < br / > Sometimes it's good if celluloid degrade. More unrecoverable life time wasted! But maybe you'll need an antidepressant instead!,0
"Unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was "" not too good "". But its a decent movie to see once I guess.",0
"The movie itself is pretty poor. After his 5 minutes, it goes from looking cool to just nothing much. 2 out of 5 stars He has a range that allows him to play just about anything.",0
"However, I found this film completely unbearable. < br / > < br / > L. A.",0
"I saw this movie on the shelf at Blockbuster and thought it looked cool. Okay, the script is awful and full of one dimensional characters. However, under - appreciated yet talented actors must earn their money.",0
"It's almost as wrecked and puffy as Nolte'face. Foprget questioning anyone. Nolte's character lights a cigaret, gets mad, and beats interviewees to a pulp.",0
Unfortunately that is the only thing even remotely impressive about this film. Quite an impressive list of names. And not a moment too soon. Nothing dramatic really happens. The dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden. Hoover and crew set out to find out.,0
"By the way, I didn't like the film.",0
"This movie was produced by the biggest producer in Costa Rica. The script is nothing impressing, it is very simple and dialogs are not very thought. Never heard of "" Pi ""? Most of the actors are lousy, except for two or three. You can make way more interesting and better pictures with less cash.",0
"The movie is about equality of sexes. Basic plot is similar to DDLJ. It is certainly not a reflection of Indian society or even Canadian society. 5 hrs, thank god. Acting is below average.",0
"This movie is not worth anything. Buy CD, if you must. Never watch this movie.",0
"Yes, MY LIFE. < br / > < br / > Honestly, I expected more. I cringe for them, I really do.",0
cast was new. There is nothing worth watching in this movie.,0
"Seriously, I never enjoyed a Hindi flick that is a copycat.",0
I'd definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie. The point is clear. I'd give this film a 1 / 10.,0
"Its hard to believe the famous Chopra's have produced this lousy movie. He gives a total crap performance, that bores you to death.",0
There is no depth to either of their characters. But this is with a western touch. It is definitely not worth spending either money or time.,0
i don even see why you would go to see it on your own.,0
"Right away, a woman arrives and announces that she is the wife's half - sister. In fact, Central and South America dig soap operas as well, I know that much.",0
What a crappy movie! It's because of movies like this. Wonder why Bollywood is going through a slump?,0
"The best actor was Blake Ritson, who captured the wholesomeness of Edmund very well, and the Crawfords were effectively cast too.",0
The camera work was non pleasing itself. Perhaps I just don't like his way of speaking or his stature. It was called Hex and a show from BBC. I agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull.,0
"< br / > < br / > Well, I had hoped for better, but had feared worse.",0
Every else looked confused or out of place.,0
"I don't see how Austen purists can be any happier with this 2007 version from ITV ( and rebroadcast on Masterpiece Theatre / PBS ). The 1999 film is reviled by many Austen purists, but I admire the job Rozema did in making Mansfield Park her own. Rozema's 1999 adaptation of Mansfield Park is far superior to this ostensibly slightly more faithful film. and her talent simply wasn't suited to the material. Read the novel before or after and make up your own mind. Sir Thomas looked constipated the whole time.",0
"< br / > < br / > Here we have Billie Piper who looks like a pretty country wench. For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adaptation might be fine. But only for them. < br / > < br / > Why has it been so hard to do a good adaptation of this book?",0
Dull script matched by even duller acting.,0
"Why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation? I really want to forget it. The whole thing feels rather rushed. if you skipped this "" Mansfield Park "" production consider yourself lucky!",0
what a mess. I wouldn't recommend this movie at all.,0
"Mrs. Norris wasn't nearly as awful as she should have been. Why bother, ITV? It's beyond me...",0
"A. Given the scope of the novel, it should not have been condensed to 85 minutes. The camera is constantly doing ultra - closeups, and swirling around and around in circles. < br / > < br / > One major negative for me was the cinematography, which I thought was just awful, and quite literally sickening.",0
! I think one is better off using the time to either read a little bit of the actual novel or simply don'thing.,0
How disappointed was I!,0
I see I must wait for BBC to weave its magic once again. Oh dear! If some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern ('his life is one long party '????? ),0
"This "" Fanny Price "" is a complete enigma. A sweet, kind, compassionate girl with a timid personality and frail constitution. Unfortunately, the result is a rather lackluster, and schizophrenic, production.",0
"Fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and I would contend that she is not meant to be. It is a very different sort of novel than the others ; it is not meant to be a love story.",0
Fortunately Jane Austen had other ideas.,0
"Talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the crying wears thin.",0
"Mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere, at what looks like a wooden building in the desert. < br / > < br / > Edited, written & directed by Patrick Rand I thought Mom was a pretty awful film. Nestor then rips her top open, turns into a monster & starts to eat her innards.",0
"The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment. I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. The acting was extremely thin. I should add here that I'm a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment. And I wish it would have been great. I know no one who worked on this film. But here, nope. < br / > < br / > That's Tomas Take on this one.",0
"< br / > < br / > However it is a very poor piece of historical work. They didn't find any. The witnesses, though presented as credible, are few and unsupported. I would avoid this. It has no clear aim to it and the entire thing could be summed up as follows.",0
A real du even by the standards of bad UK TV.,0
"Mostly all I remember is that this movie was kind of like a movie from the 1970's called "" The Deep "". It was simply boring to watch, so much in fact I could just never really get into it. Bunch of looking for treasure, rival groups that sort of thing. Of course, it does not help this movie at all.",0
"Despite this the end product is usually enjoyable fun for the non - discerning. The wreck turns out to be that of the'El Diablo ', which went down centuries earlier.",0
"Again just another thing that leaves you high and dry. However there's a real lack of cohesion. Tatty, but watchable.",0
"The Evil Below starts on'The Straits of San Sebastian 1683'as the 17th century treasure ship the El Diablo sinks in a violent thunderstorm. ), she hires Max & his scantily clad assistant Tracy ( Sheri Able ) so she can try to locate the El Diablo & get rich.",0
Sadly it's closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements.,0
If worse comes to worse it will cure you insomnia. Yeah it's barely titillating but heh!,0
5 / 10.,0
"Well when I turned around the DVD and it showed the 3 stages of hell, well I had to buy it. Not a bad thing, but there is a narrator in this one. It was pretty raw, bare and unbiased. Which would of been nice to have, a message or reason for this doc. on that Attack of the Show show. < br / > < br / > Wrestling wise, this is pretty boring. the better bumps are at the beginning, and slowly become less amazing and shocking.",0
#NAME?,0
Just opinion.,0
"A perfect genre for Sci - Fi Channel. Not so, here.",0
Don't we have enough problems in this world already? Showing Moses as a murderer. I wanted to stone writers. I am not a religious person at all.,0
"I don't, just some of these corporate profit grubbers. Even the "" miracle "" scenes were contrived & un - believable.",0
It becomes boring. This film lacked both! You don't see this here. They became their roles.,0
fast fwd to mount sinai moses comes down the 2nd time with two sets of tablets First and for most lets start with the script and characters the skeleton that makes up the body of a movie. Moses's wife Tzipora was married to moses and she therefore covered herself and being as humble as they were did not cuddle or hold hands in public. Well it sucked.. way more then i thought it would.,0
"Everything in this movie was about Moses. NEVER!!!!!! ! God directed everything, he told them where to go and what to do. God worked directly with the people. How dare they say otherwise not even close to the passage. He was there the whole time.",0
"And, predictably, none of it is entertaining.",0
? Instead of re - hashing old films. I think I did.,0
The acting really wasn't that great. And um... God's voice / lines were kinda weird.,0
This movie was dreadful. Biblically very inaccurate.,0
"As excited as I was to see this film, I was greatly disappointed in the storyline. The movie, however, depicts a God who remains silent during the entire wandering through the desert. He never left them ; He always was visible to the Israelites. ( I'll leave out the videography, special effects, and artistic ability in this review. ) < br / > < br / > In addition, the depiction of Moses was just as wrong.",0
"Not just the story, but the acting as well. Not so here. The script is already written. See Revelation 22 : 18 - 19. This is standard procedure with any Biblical Hallmark - made film. Hallmark makes good movies "". Remember "" Noah ""?? That might be so, but they butcher the Bible.",0
"Those who know the book of Exodus well will see not only inconsistencies in the movie, but outright glaring changes to events. Far from being alone as portrayed in the movie, Moses is guided by God with detailed and direct communication. God is largely removed from the movie, and instead viewers are given the impression that Moses had to figure things out for himself. For instance, after the golden calf God plagues the people and they must look upon a symbol of a serpent to live. Read Exodus for yourself, there is no substitute. To compensate, Hallmark has actually changed some things. The twisted events and changes make this danger to anyone who doesn't know their Bible. Moses side wins of course. Nothing could be further from the truth.",0
I will not waste my time again watching this movie. This movie deviated from the Bible and fell so below the bar of the 1956 movie.,0
"I doubt this one will make it to the realm of yearly classic, as the other one has.",0
This story falls completely flat in this area.,0
"Obviously, they didn't want to leave a LASTING impression of "" faith and sacrifice "", which is much needed in these trouble times. Of course, I was let down.",0
"And big surprise, there are no favorable deviations! < br / > < br / > What was the whole Joshua thing? This rendition had some HUGE problems with deviation from scripture. ( Chapter 19 ). This was a good rendition of the story. Yes there were violent aspects of this story. But the second half was horrible!!!",0
"< br / > < br / > Otherwise, this movie just seems to go on forever. After a heated affair, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate ways. He seems to be living life like a ghost. Of a boring story that seems to go on forever, it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks.",0
"Waste two hours. Very little music or anything to speak of. The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning...",0
"It was good. Superb edition? It'a flaw. To me, more form than essence. Don't think so : the film is weak.",0
"And believe me, it does seem endless.",0
It doesn't age well. But even caricatures need a plausible plot line.,0
"Arthur MacArthur, for god's sake. did they actually pay the writers of this show?",0
"A for effort. Actually, that is virtually the only positive praise one can offer. The best one can say about the Sci Fi channel's attempt to make Dune into a miniseries is that it's ambitious.",0
Avoid this movie at all costs.,0
Including horses and beaches. This movie is the final straw. Save yourself.,0
The acting is average to bad.,0
"Time. < br / > < br / > But at least he has charisma, right? Paul Atreides? The actor's only 25? Wrong. Alec Newman is a stumbling, mumbling buffoon.",0
"What can I say? The effects in general were pretty second rate. It should have been called "" Frank Herbert's Dune - For Dummies "". The worms! I felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most.",0
"Paul the stand - up comedian. 3. with matching silly hat, together with a couple of guys with silly balloon hats. It is a lot more but This is the "" Battlefield Earth "" of mini series. Baron Harkonnen in over acting overdrive, screaming "" I, m alive "". Every scene with the Fremen's fake religious cermonies, specially the "" water of life "" cermony.",0
Nothing was happening. In my first attempt at watching it I fell asleep. The DVD came with a second disk which contained bonus material.,0
"< br / > < br / > Without prophecy, what is the point of Dune? Rather than complete a text - to - celluloid transfer of the novel, the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines, absent from the original novel. Gone. Now this story shall probably never be translated to film again, and this I find heartrending. How sad that this is all we are provided with. It is simply a more educated and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. I agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries, and agree that it does have its pros, not only its cons. Lynch'film was flawed, yes.",0
We did. Not even watchable. It was overdone.,0
"Rock Hudson looks pretty fit here. He never quite makes it in this role, however. I suppose I'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt. There is always something they didn't anticipate.",0
"Hudson looks like he lost interest in project about halfway through the film. The special effects as they are, are pretty second rate. What she doesn't do is develop emotionally. < br / > < br / > What he gets is Barbara Carrera.",0
"< br / > < br / > Predictably, things go very wrong. I guess he needed the work. Much of the action takes place in a poorly lighted laboratory. He raises Victoria ( the beautiful Barbara Carrera ) from a fetus the same way.",0
"His experiment works too well, with some decidedly unpleasant side effects.",0
"Simple. The embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase. Something must have gone wrong during the production of Ralph Nelson's "" Embryo "". The basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving, as we're all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies.",0

It isn't worth a second look that'for sure. A buddy and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. It was so bad that we laughed all the way through it. Sorry.,0
"He does wear the full regalia Nazi uniform at some points. MASTER PLAN : have the winning team in a deadly tournament. I thought he would be some secret government agent here but apparently not. There are a few good fights during the tournament towards the climax, but none really stand out. The sound FX are also amped up and exaggerated in an attempt to add more impact to the blows. ).",0

I personally I'm glad the studio lost big money after the way the real Lone ranger was treated. Maybe even a cameo in the new movie. Also the story and acting were weak. You don't treat an American icon that way. To many Americans Clayton Moore was just that the ; the one and only lone ranger.,0

I love Umberto Lenzi's cop movies - - ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite - - and his DESERT COMMANDOS pretty much legitimized the Italian Euro War phenomenon by managing to actually be a pretty good movie. < br / > < br / > What a shame it is then to encounter his EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX.

And they withheld information. You see that Kantor has an injury, and you just assume it's from all her training, but then several scenes later they finally clue you in that it's because she tripped over a pine cone in her yard. The timing was also hard to follow, because it was semi chronological, but the filmmakers rarely gave you any good clues as to what point in time you were looking at. Yeah, real inspiring.",0

In'64, we have John Milner ( Paul Le Mat ) who is now a professional drag racer. It's a chore to watch! It was her going to a concert... not much of anything happened. Why was this sequel made?",0
"This film wasn't necessary either as I was glad to see that neither Lucas or Dreyfuss moved on to bigger and better projects. < br / > < br / > Somehow without those two, the magic died off.

He doesn't even look like Harrison Ford, who was way too big a star by 1979 to even bother with this garbage. This movie isn't even amusing. John Milner ( Paul LeMat ) is a loser race car driver whose fortune was foretold at the end of the original.",0
"The first one belongs up there with the rest of the greats. I gave it a 4. The film doesn't have humor that the original had, and we were expecting to laugh. What little humor is there is dark. This one just doesn't cut it.",0

Surely someone involved ( Steven Soderbergh, executive producer? )",0

"Perhaps this insularity reflects the ongoing "" War on Terror "". The makers missed the point that globalisation does not mean Americanisation.

"Hence Sefeld's leaving the sitcom while right up there, instead of sticking around for the inevitable decline. Leaving us fans with better memories of far better films they had done earlier. Always leave them laughing is the motto for comedy and always quit while you're on top.",0
"We were far from the only country doing that however. Watching Barricade is like eating a badly cooked meal. Why Alice's song was cut out, God and Zanuck only know. The accent intrigues Warner Baxter who's pretty plastered.",0
"It fared modestly OK at the box - office. Instead, it is entirely missing and what could have been an exciting sequence ( including a complete song number by Faye ) was never filmed. However, the rest of the story is pretty much intact and made release of the film possible at a running time of 71 minutes. < br / > < br / > A tired looking WARNER BAXTER is too old to be believable as Faye's romantic interest and is merely perfunctory as the broken down reporter. Originally, Joseph Schildkraut had a role in the film but his part was eventually edited out.",0
It deserved better telling than that!! There was not enough depth displayed of this situation. I rented this from the library.,0

"< br / > < br / > It gets worse. At the end of the film, Frank celebrates one year of sobriety. The viewer starts to root for him as they notice positive changes in his life. It alternates between Italian, Russian, and Hispanic. If you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you're not alone. The movie plunges headlong into idiocy with the introduction of the Tea Leoni character. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hit man for some Russian mobsters based out of Buffalo.",0

Anyways, apart from that the movie was finalized. ).",0
"It wasn't a great film by any means, but it was nowhere near the garbage I had prepared myself for, well in advance, sight unseen. In fact, HARDCORE ( 1979 ) is one of my very favorite films. It was relentlessly talky, uninteresting, and insipid. Remember the silly ending in Harlin's rendition ( which I'll also agree tainted the rest of that movie )? I have nothing at all against Paul Schrader. They're here in DOMINION as well.",0

"There are so many reasons to hate the film but the worst is how incredibly ponderous the whole thing was! However, part - way through the film he died unexpectedly. Tyrone Power was cast in the lead as Solomon.",0

It wasn't until I looked at the trivia section that I found out that the original producer / star of this movie Tyrone Power died during its making. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon or God when you've got an idiotic enemy who can't see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall? You can't really blame them since there's few things more beautiful in the world than those Israeli moteks, though the Israeli women here all seem to look like Cherie Blair! Isn't this somewhat illogical?",0
"After that Adonijah gets to plotting. For that matter neither was Solomon. I was in the 5th grade and well remember the huge news for days when that tragedy happened. That is the heart of this film. He was the unnamed producer of this as well. I didn't know who Tyrone Power was then, but I learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work.",0

The Lifetime channel aired this in October but I only got around to watching it now.,0
It comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties. This movie bored me. It was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots.,0

This film is plain crap. He seems to be always sermonizing. Anybody could do that.,0
Until now.,0
"His character was just too much of a tool, as Brandon or Jonathan. The accent, his shirt off, corny pick up lines, weak sales pitches. I just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly. Needless to say I was very disappointed. Just finished watching 2FTM. 1. Pacino and Assante were great, but that'no surprise. Enough about that, let's get into his role. Cool story that appeals to the male man 2.",0
"Another entry in the Pacino - As - Mentor sub - genre. is discovered by glamorous and delightfully corrupt father figure ( Pacino, natch ). * Two for Like his contemporary De Niro, Pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels.

The meeting and the airport. Including this one. Utter.,0
"Hopefully his next role will be in the company of more talented people. In other words when he could act, he didn't have to talk like some street junkie. Probably the worse thing that McConaughey has played in. Oh yes, the movie... Rene Russo as always was hot.",0
Ski this!!,0
"I wasn't so impressed with this film, finding it quite tiresome and plain. This ACCEPTED failed to raise a smile!",0
We were not disappointed in the least. I don't see you wearing any pants in this equation.,0
Only the poster may be appealing. Very poor script and acting. The colours are very impersonal and light.,0
"Plus, I am a big Pacino fan. < br / > < br / > Don't waste your money. You are in shape Matt. OK, we get it.",0

The main problem is that the movie is so unbelievably inert. In all regards Solo is a very weak film.,0
Solo is a poor film - that cannot be ignored.,0
"He looks like he is doing the Robot Dance most of time. Guess which category SOLO falls into. It is horribly written and acted, and the big fight at the end if downright comical.",0
"Calling it "" pathetic "" is a gross understate.",0
"Truth is that this jerk has been rejected by every school he has applied to. After viewing this junk, you will see why.",0
Enough said really. My TV guide described Solo as a'dire sci - fi action starring Mario Van Peebels'which when I think about it is a perfect description of Solo.,0
There is NOTHING worthwhile about this film.,0
It lacks the substance that most movies possess. The special effects were decent as well.,0
Plus he looks nothing like Michael Jackson?! Terrible acting and terrible storyline. Van Peebles is a joke in this film. This is probably the worst film I have EVER seen.,0
Good night!,0

"The song "" crazy "" was such a cliché. I love Patsy Cline but she her songs appear quite frequently in films. The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves. Sorry.",0
"Megan meets a lost little girl ( Channing Nichols ) and a wounded WWII soldier. Kresler is impressive to a degree and writer / director James makes good use of Patsy Cline tunes. All in all, moderately interesting Sci - Fi. The nightmarish journey doesn't end there.",0

I am getting sick of all these new stupid straight to DVD horror movies. The rest got weird and then got confusing.,0

I own this movie. Overall 6 / 10 on the go chart. And it is terribly hard to find.,0
this movie was downright awful. the plot itself is so shallow and easy to predict.,0
"Anathema. Go Rent "" Circle of Iron "" or "" The Killer Shrews instead.",0
It sucked also. No independent horror films were being made in NC. Patterson died in the late 70's.,0
"Does that sound familiar? BOTH WERE TERRIBLE!! ENNNNNNNNNDDDDDD!!! "" He talked about how this movie was lost, and then found years after the director's death. But, I made it through the movie, and came out stronger. I want to know where half of the 15 gallons went.",0
"The girl Anitra is real attractive, but yet that is not a good enough reason to enjoy this movie.",0
"I can't believe I even tried to watch this filth. I laughed for the better part of 10 minutes. If you like movies that are bad, watch this one. I almost want to puke at the very thought of this movie.",0
At one point you can actually see a movie slateboard quite obviously. Skip it.,0

"Also, Timothy Dalton would have been better than Roger Moore in this, so there wouldn't have been so much of an age difference between Bond and Octopussy.",0
This only accentuated the differences between Moore and his stunt double. And the Russian General was total goof. This only made his fight scenes more comedic. OCTOPUSSY works better as a comedy spoof similar to SPIES LIKE US. Even the hair color did not match.,0
"Firstly there was absolutely no plot to begin with, just an excuse for Moore to tell his corny jokes. Firstly let me get this of my chest I hate Octopussy with an absolute passion.",0

"i cant really remember what he was, so who really cares? ( F F - ) the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie. the girls were lame and pathetic, i mean, how can they own their own clothing line, dolls, movies, producing studios, and not smell this bomb from far away?",0
"This is why people think Americans have no culture. A stupid movie, with a stupid plot. Kyoto, anyone??",0
"I was left speechless. I guess the two boys were okay, fake French accents aside.",0
"Blah blah blah. So it had to be somewhat entertaining. Yep. This movie was alright. I mean, can I really identify at all with two girls who are devastated upon hearing that they're going to Paris? The fact that was set in Paris was what probably kept me watching.",0
That is all. Therefore I will not bother the France trip no matter what. Germany and the United Kingdom are the nations I tolerate.,0
"the plaaaain! "" Same as in SS. ( However, in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot. ) Why does Khan hold a knife against McCoy's throat? Is the Starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots? That's one of several ST plot - devices that undermine Kirk's intelligence. One of the more prominent / popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst.",0
"Well, she can have it. It happened not once, not twice, but THREE times! It's uncanny how quickly a woman can accept having her eyesight taken away from her.",0
"Except in this case it doesn't. Daft potboilers don't come much dafter than this, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie which makes everything alright. To make amends he takes up medicine, becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it. In between times, they fall in love.",0
"Rock Hudson can be forgiven. I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed. This must have been a period when she was well liked by her Academy peers. As for the movie itself, it is truly amazing that Jane Wyman was even nominated for an Academy Award.",0
"Hippocrates might have had something to say about that! Rock Hudson, in the role that catapulted him to stardom, plays Bob Merrick, a drunken playboy worth untold millions who is more interested in chasing skirts and racing speedboats than in finishing his medical degree. In the first scene, he wrecks his boat on a sumptuously photographed lake. ( Why don't we see any of this amazing art? )",0
What? Fans of Gimli ( John Rhys - Davies ) might be interested in seeing him in a different role as Inspector Marais.,0
As I said : life is cruel. I don't think so. This is no Disney film. The lesson learned? Family entertainment? Please don't!,0
"Nope. But those aren't kid movies and don't advertise themselves as such. 5 year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room. Heck, I love the ultra violent Battle Royale. Lots of blood, not just a little. And the photography is quiet nice. We put the film on for our 3.",0
The writing was patronizing and convoluted. This is not entirely the actors fault.,0
His family shouldn't have to relive that horror. I don't know where to begin. Please don't watch this if you have any self respect. ).,0
I don't recommend.,0
A disappointment if you have seen Ice - T in other roles.,0
Yah. Otherwise it's just a stupid film. It's not.,0
IMD Rating : 5.,0
"It's quite unprofessional, and adds nothing. The drama is forced, and the humor makes no sense. "", none of it is believable.",0
That was true to life. The only piece I enjoyed was the conversation with the drunk. There is no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens. One gets out of theater unsure of why these two got together or want to split.,0
I can't recommend work. I don't know if this story would have suited a Japanese couple. We don't even know who took the initiative of asking the divorce.,0
Sadly this film falls into the later category. I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. From then on things go down hill.,0
< br / > < br / > But wait! This film just doesn't come close. I highly suspect that Hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture.,0
"Perhaps I'm too much a purist. All the same, he plays a better Hamlet than Gibson.",0
I found no attachment or real interest in any of the characters. I saw this movie a while ago and I was looking forward to it.,0
"She was too dull and unreal, whereas",0
"For God's sake that is what makes the play last as long as it does. And lets face it, Hamlet without the prince really doesn't work. 2. His sexual disgust. You could not get further from the character of Hamlet if you tried. So, what does Mel Gibson give us? At the slightest hint of sex, Hamlet throws up.",0
etc.,0
"To be frank, even Disney'Hamlet is better. Casting is another issue.",0
I wish I had listened.,0
NO WONDER THIS WAS NEVER RELEASED IN THE USA.,0
'.,0
This screams of a low budget high school production.,0
The DVD is out at the moment in the UK.,0
org.,0
"However, the tone is either so self - pitying or so arch, that it's impossible to engage with either characters or plot. What a self - indulgent mess!",0
I'm a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising A. K. A. A missed opportunity.,0
"And a rather poor outfit, too. The film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of Upstairs and Downstairs. The audience is beaten into submission by chiche upon chiche about the British class system.",0
"AKA < br / > < br / > Aspect ratio : 3 x 1. 78 : 1 within 2. Also starring Diana Quick ( as an outrageous snob who believes working class people are "" embarrassed to be alive ""!",0
Actually it sort of stinks. Diana Quick must be cringing with embarrassment.,0
Nothing of that would happen like this on a real sailing vessel. But regarding the story and dialogs I only can call it big crap.,0
"But why go on? The dialog offends the ear. There's a lot of tearing up, and considerable crying. ( The dolphin business. ) Who WROTE this thing? Well, it IS that, in a way. The kids start out as kids and end up as an organic group.",0
"The priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the "" naked "" truth. I enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it. In the end, failing to gain any followers, he must enter into the gates of heaven alone.",0
"The whole "" hitting the road to find meaning in life "" theme is still kind of interesting though. I wasn t so sure. Does it all really lead back to family?",0
Not any more. The direction is gli at best and at worst film - making by numbers.,0
"And when you see hero's wife's attitude, you may think she must never have heard about woman's lib. But you can enjoy them without this tedious pretentious work.",0
( I actually thought some interesting plot elements might develop. ),0
But this film fails on either level in that regard. It captures the absolute essence of the Cal character.,0
"I can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to end. One of these twin boys - Niles - is supposed to be "" good "". THE OTHER is a supposed "" horror "" movie made during the 1970s. Almost every single scene takes place in daytime! Believe me, it isn't. < br / > < br / > The direction is as bland as you could possibly find. Does it sound scary or atmospheric?",0
"It's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about. Watch the first 5 minutes and you'll see what I mean. And where did they find these "" actresses ""? I have seen some bad acting, but this takes the cake. Wow! The film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm.",0
Want a real synopsis? A disjointed plot made worse by hideous acting. Ad this one to the trash heap. The on - location sets weren't even passable.,0
AND FAILED. < br / > < br / > STAY AWAY from. Good God they left the date and time counter on during some of it. OK - say some college in southern California has an movie making class.,0
I used to be one of them. Guys with hairy chests show up and girls with fangs who are out in the sunlight.,0
"On a channel like HBO or Cinemax, things like that are expected. < br / > < br / > Too bad, really. On G4, it's tragic.",0
It should be used to torture prisoners. No wait.,0
"As it stands though, I live, but I am forever scarred by experience. 3. If a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. < br / > < br / > It is hard to say what is more disturbing :.",0
Even then... Are all of those images necessary? Wow - - this movie was really bad!,0
What next?,0
"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, except cinema - goers who like to laugh at a film, not with it. < br / > < br / > The direction of the storyline borrows heavily from Se7en, but here it is executed far more simplistically, and far too obviously. I laughed out loud and shook my head. < br / > < br / > Quite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film.",0
"Now that was a bright idea eh? By the time he returns ( still no senior cops, SOCOs or other assistance for the lovely Jolie - this is New York isn't it?? ) The horror continues : - not in the film itself ( pretty ordinary I'm afraid ) but in the Lincoln Rhyme character as played by Mr Washington. it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence, only after she'd stood in front of an Amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene.",0
"The character's are truly awful & I didn't believe any of them were actual human beings. First we have Lincoln Rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down & there's just not a lot the script can do with him, in fact he quite literally can't do anything but lie in bed for the whole film. Why is he so impressed with her? The script by Jeremy Iacone was based on book by Jeffery Deaver & is so poor on so many levels I hardly know where to begin.",0
"I wrote better stories than this when I was in Junior High. The characters are two - dimensional. Who cares?! "" People like serial killer stuff. 4. I can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script : < br / > < br / > 1. I know ; he'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel.",0
"This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. Anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window ). This movie stinks, and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp.",0
The plot is lame.,0
"Shyeah, right. No the woman steps out of the corner, she has just shot him in the back. < br / > < br / > In the meantime, he helps out on a serial killer case.",0
The music is terrible.,0
But now?,0
"( One just concludes our clever hero is an idiot - - deadly for a film like this. ) < br / > < br / > This one is not worth the time. For well plotted episode of this series, see Alias Boston Blackie.",0
It's totally forgettable.,0
"I wish I could have fallen asleep. Don't waste your time. The two don't make a good pair on the big screen. < br / > < br / > There are tons of great movies that should be seen before one. I can not say anything bad about Andie, I always enjoy her acting.",0
"My girlfriend wanted to see this ( lol this is the case a lot )... so I rented it. I just didn't feel a completeness with Bugsy. Then I saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 Oscars. How'd he get in with the likes of Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano anyway?? ? I just didn't see the big deal with this, and it was a big disappointment. There just didn't seem to be much of a real story here. I'm guessing that's how Siegel really was.... but it was just too much of that. this should be good ol'drama.",0
"You never once believe that Mantegna came from the streets. Bugsy Siegel was 31 when he went out to the West Coast. < br / > < br / > The other big annoying miscast is Mantegna as George Raft. In addition to his dreams about Las Vegas, he toyed with the idea of acting.",0
< br / > < br / > I really wouldn't bother with this turgid drama unless you're a Benning devote. A tedious gangster film that leaves you wishing someone had edited it farce more ruthlessly.,0
"The other actors don't fare as well either. Try as he might, Warren Beatty just could not be believed as Bugsy. Either way, I don't like it. Not as bad as "" Billy Bathgate "" but close.",0
Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulin?,0
"But of course he's the hero of the movie, so naturally the idea had to be his. < br / > < br / > Not until much later Benny warmed to the idea. < br / > < br / > The whole Greenberg subplot was nonsense. He even met Goebbels and Goering during his sojourn in Italy.",0
Gawd only knows I deserve it. Maybe I ` m psychic? MILD SPOILERS!!!! Nevertheless I just knew JUDGE AND JURY was going to be crap and it was.,0
I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case.,0
"What good is there? Another horror movie you ask? Well, that's perfectly explainable.",0
"But why stop there? The plot is just poor. Cinematography... oh, dear. Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas? ).",0
"But that is the film's main flaw, since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together.",0
"This movie tries hard, but ultimately fails. A. "" I laughed my head off when this happened.",0
The film is quite boring.,0
Let's have a look at what the Brits were producing 1995 - 2005 : < br / > < br / > Funky gangster thrillers. Perhaps the greatest irony is the title of film.,0
This movie was dreadful. The acting atrocious.,0
It's mess. That pretty much sums up Satanik. The drug works and she becomes beautiful. The camera lingers on shots too long after the scene is over.,0
Bull! There are only a few stills of Magda and that's it. Coincidence??,0
"But, as it is, it's just a lacklustre and boring crime film that isn't really worth looking for. The experiments were successful, but the animals became aggressive. Rating : 3 out of 10.",0
"< br / > < br One of the cops sweats a lot and pats his face with a cloth. Anyone with a lick of sense, seeing the fake old age, knows what's coming next. Trash? The film makes no attempt to explain how cornflakes got there. The other smokes a pipe. Zounds! What does it all mean?! They're never developed beyond the level of finger puppets.",0
"Oh the tension, you could cut it with a spoon. Too bad that couldn't have become more of the plot. Dennis would have to take me kicking and screaming. The assumed off - screen drama leading up to this tragedy. Oh.",0
"99 I've been ripped off. 99, thinking I'd lucked into some documentary pearl that would actually show extensive footage of the Karakoram mountains, and K2 in particular. At $ 4.",0
"K2 "" is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering. Rounding off the main Biehn as a foul - mouthed, pushy, adventurous type is especially hard to like, as is Barry as the hard - nosed mountaineering millionaire. Taylor and Harold put themselves forward as potential replacements.",0
""", I was encouraged to hope that this might be a gritty and accurate man - vs - nature odyssey. There is some good climbing footage at the start ; and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the film "" How much experience above 8000 metres do you have? I can't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic. Also, you would sound like a bit of a tit if you said "" welcome to the death zone "" at 200000 feet. Only near the summit is a little fatigue suggested, to dramatically accentuate the physical feat of climbing such a monstrous peak, almost as an afterthought.",0
This isn't even a dark comedy. I think not. < br / > < br / > This movie has borderline insanity. No memorial was made.,0
"I wouldn't hire the screenwriter to write my grocery list. The others are forgettable. It shows the total lack of imagination of the office suits... The plot limps along, with a predictable ending. And a genre that has been done so much better before.",0
"That was the moment when I switched OFF this programme, never to return. < br / > < br / > P. P. S. Good news for those who liked it! They are cold bores. There will be a second series in Autumn 2007 - though without the male lead.",0
"And, like almost all dramedies, "" Straight - Jacket "" fails miserably. This film tries to skewer the studio era in Hollywood and the morals of the 1950s. Cartwright is very good, but the director doesn't quite know what to do with her. As written, Preston's Sally is good for a laugh but little else. He cannot act, and seems to have been cast for his hot body and good looks. Newcomer Adam Greer is lost in this movie.",0
The movie seems not to know - - or care. Marry him off to an unsuspecting woman in order to quell the gossips ( and keep him working ). ).,0
"'continues as if this was just a normal revelation like any other you might usually encounter in a thriller. This review contains a partial spoiler. O.

Another negative feature is the ugly 80s soundtrack.",0
How bad is that? And she's always exciting to see. My wife concurred. It looked like a wonderful story. < br / > < br / > I never walked out of a movie faster.,0
"< br / > < br / > First of all Terence Stamp is 10 years in hiding because he testified against some of his former partners in crime. The Hit, however suffers from everything that made silly crime pictures silly. Stephen Frears often tried to emulate French new wave in English style film making and the two don't match. He hides in Spain, of all places. First of all, the 80's were not a good decade for crime and thriller genre. This film holds 7. What a waste of 100 minutes.",0
This is just stupid. The bog woman is talking Swedish not Danish.,0
And the filmmakers are like 60 years old. This one was worse than Scarecrow Slayer ( we didn't think that was even POSSIBLE ). None found. Who are these people? ).?,0
"It really made the acting and drama look ridiculous in my eyes. Really bad research, considering the director is from Denmark. Strange things happens : something is in the forest, and people start disappearing. Its feels like a mini - Hollywood in Denmark, and it takes away the credibility of the movie. < br / > < br / > The bog creatures are cheap, but they had the potential to be scary. Nomatter where you are, there is never more than 50 km to the sea, and 500 meters to civilization. I saw this movie yesterday on a public service channel.",0
"Thankfully, I found it in a discount bin somewhere. This is like a bad Nickelodeon movie ( as apposed to a more decent one I guess ). First, I would recommend that they watch the special feature MAKING OF thing included on the disc. < br / > < br / > The only people I would recommend this move to is aspiring guerrilla filmmakers. They knew enough to have fun, but in long run, without necessary skills, this interprets to : They knew enough to be dangerous. Even more so now in this day and age.

"it does hold weight to fact why Corrupt wants to kill MJ but is still makes u scratch your head. it was OK tho. the movie was similar to the film Urban Menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team. but me being from poverty i love hood films, however if u don't love em like i do Don't WATCH IT. < br / > < br / > Nathaniel Pure but this movie was something different.",0

If you fall into the tar you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds. There is a reason for where the sex scene is at. The motive for the murders was incredibly stupid.,0

Not for a second. The drama. They weren't funny unless you were five. This film shouldn't have been made. It sets you up for the laugh. But not this film. The jokes reminded one of the recent Star Wars films. But the emotions.,0

I watched it and was very disappointed.,0
"You're a poser. The monsters don't menace because they're not foreshadowed, simply thrown at the screen. < br / > < br / > But this movie? Really, Gaiman, get over yourself. Well, that was sure a waste of Dave McKean's talents, wasn't it? Pity.",0
"It just required the need for the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist. The ill mother theme is never fully explained and certainly not something that you care about while lapping up eye candy. Who would this engage? Wow, what exciting visual effects.",0
"I live in hope but last night was no exception. Read the rest of the comments and all his faults are eloquently described. I saw "" Mirrormask "" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.

"< br / > < br / > Well - I wasted my money. I admit - I was lured to this one from the hype - and I didn't stop to consider the sources. "" There is even a storyline ( kinda ) and that is about it. But not all was bad in this movie. We get gay sex - sorta.",0
The acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street. It's like a ninth grade audio - visual class project.,0
"A lot, a lot! < br / > < br / > This is a very, very gory movie. Turn down the volume if you value your eardrums and your nerves!",0
"The acting in this was Atrocious, really, it blew. And that gay sex scene was just thrown in there for no reason.",0
"Many a viewer of a 1980s music video will find theloppy direction somewhat nostalgic. It's almost as if this song was made for the sole reason of padding out the album's running time. Unfortunately, this opening voice - over hits the nail right on the head. < br / > < br / > Where it all goes downhill is the second number, I'm Not Home Right Now. Cheech's conception of British punk is also incredibly funny.",0
"This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish, one of the most well - known serial - killers in the world. Visually, this film is interesting.",0
The story line was so loose that it really never came together.,0
Laughable special effects.,0
And who might the salty sea - captain be? Maybe 84 Lumber is really an agent for God????? At least I think it was God.,0
This was the worst Bible movie I have ever seen.,0
"? Absolutely inaccurate, I mean, they've put Sodom and Gomora BEFORE the great flood. They've described Lot as a friend of Noah although he lived after Noah.",0
My kids stood astonished because even THEY know that Lot was not even thought of when Noah was building the ark. I love John Voight but I have no idea what possessed him to be a part of this travesty. ! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!,0
NBC should be ashamed. The ark had NO deck.,0
What were the scriptwriters thinking?,0
"It's just a feature to list on the packaging. That's another comment in the making. It is the same game with the same locations of the same animals each time. < br / > < br / > And, oh yeah, the game never changes.",0
Poetic rape.,0
! But still it was 20 times better than Showtime. The movie had its funny parts but wasn't that great.,0
EVERYONE else was dead except for Noah and his family according to scripture. Hello?,0
This is the worst movie I have EVER seen! It too was destroyed at the same time Sodom was. The producers probably did not even read the Bible.,0
"Kids flying kites. frying pan. )... that is, those video stores that dare to stock it.",0
"Where are they getting this from? What the director's saying in this, I don't claim to know. God is portrayed as a petty, incomprehesible being who changes his mind at slightest whim. but at least it's a step up from Voight's hilarious overacting in Anaconda. You were kissing! "" Oh boy. ( "" I'm one eternal perfect, but I can be wrong "" ) What?",0
How offensive! I only gave this movie a 1 because I couldn't give it a 0.,0
Everything is bad. So if you value your time and sanity stay away from this horror.,0
This is the most inacurrate adaptation of any story ever!,0
A loose interpretation? Are you kidding!,0
Do not see movie. This move is terrible.,0
"I don't understand jokes. Either way, they both doomed the entire hour and a half spent on the Hollywood nightmare "" Showtime "". There was the idea that Murphy was an actor, but outside of that one opening monologue, nobody would have understood that. There weren't the overbearing physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this debacle of a film. This just didn't compute even for Hollywood standards. Where was the television show in this? Russo had to get permission from this random guy at the beginning, but there were no consequences. It became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns. This falls to either two problems the director really doesn't have a sense of comedy or the editor didn't understand the value of the film. ), but that was dropped and never developed.",0
I think the makers have a lot to answer for. There are no words strong enough to describe exactly how i feel about this. I would like to know why anybody on earth could enjoy viewing this.,0
"Everything about it is bad, from the cheap sets to the phony backdrops, a bunch of paintings enlarged.",0
Dramatic?,0
God help the NBC executives come judgement day. But I thought that EVERYONE was wiped out. Sorry.,0
"imdb. I'll dispense with the obvious review of factual inaccuracies. http : / / www. Possibly the worst movie ever made. Dude named Noah. 2. By then, they have read almost half of Genesis, so they might want to finish.",0
"The result is blasphemous and annoying. Even God Himself is not spared in this movie, in that His words are drenched with childish jokes.",0
"? If they were intentionally trying to offend, why not advertise it that way and at least reel in the right audience? This was possibly the worst marketing decision in history.",0
"The script is so dumb, so pointless, and yes, TOTALLY INACCURATE! I've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film. And what was up with Noah's sons acting like Indiana Jones, saving girls in distress? Give me a break! This film is the most tasteless and disgraceful Biblical film ever made. Newsflash NBC, GOD CAN NOT BE WRONG!",0
"Actually, it's more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screentime. < br / > < br / > With little on screen to keep my attention, my mind began to wander, and that's dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes. Funny thing is, as the movie progresses, his character and Murphy's begin to act more and more like the clichés they supposedly clash so strongly with. This film doesn't just have its cake and eat it too ; it has the whole bakery. Bubbling just beneath the surface of Showtime is a good idea. In the first of many errors and oddities in the movie, that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the film. Russo's character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye, but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress'enthusiasm.",0
How many methamphetamines was Bogdonovitch on during the filming of this movie?,0
"Scenes are re - set from the novel, and lest we forget, Jane Austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. Judy Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. Austen has been Bronteized! The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear, it de It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester!",0
"Later, you see Charlotte kowtow to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, which was not at all in her character as described in the book. She only wants "" a comfortable home. "" Charlotte's explanation of why she accepted Mr. Collins'proposal begins beautifully. However, the beautiful dialogue is ruined when she blubbers, "" Don't you judge me, Elizabeth. < br / > < br / > There are some really stellar moments in this movie - - perhaps a total of 10 minutes are truly excellent. I actually appreciated that scene, simply because I like to see a happy ending, rather than just know that it took place. Don't you dare judge me! "" and runs off in tears. Very nice. However, this film scarcely resembles the original book. Let me begin by saying that I adore the book and loved the A & E miniseries.",0
"I also laughed more at the Bollywood version. However, for me, it also made a travesty of the true spirit of Austen's most beloved work. < br / > < br / > Ugh, the script. Stick to Austen's words ; she did it better than you! "". and "" Leave me alone for once in your lives!",0
"Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased. < br / > < br / > It was so obviously trying to be a * serious * film. It's about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society.",0
"Wait for the DVD and use to keep a table from wobbling. It has the directorial and scripting skill of Shoreditch. < br / > < br / > Quotes from book are thrown in out of context. Bingley likewise acts the fool and it is imcomrepnsible that he my be a friend of Darcy. Huge chunks are missing, the important episode with Wickham is glossed over.",0
"Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. He looks also too young to play Mr Darcy. As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all. He is just bizarre! Where are corsets? 1 / 3 of the way through I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. < br / > < br / > Not only that, this movie is Boring.",0
"Were everyone else sees Darcy as a sex god the writer of this saw him as sexually frustrated and inadequate. It is Historically inaccurate and even the ending is unsatisfying. As if! I went to see suspecting I would hate it, I did. They had servants.",0
"I cannot think of anything good to say about film apart from that it eventually ended! Absolutely abysmal - even the too few minutes of Judi Dench cannot save this rubbish. Keira Knightley grimaces and grins through every scene, and came across as being so obnoxious that no - one would want to marry her!",0
"If he wants bucolic, he should try Tess. Completely over top with excessive shrieking and skipping. The latter should set up the prejudice side of things. And in her role you see Wright's major error - there is NO PREJUDICE. < br / > < br / > And Elizabeth. If it doesn't - don't include it. And the pigs wandering through!",0
"< br / > < br / > As for the acting, the best is done by Judi Dench, who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy. It is also a commentary on the class structure of Regency Britain. The gentry would not have been dancing as if they were at a peasant barn dance. The juxtaposition of the two styles is jarring. This is an unforgivable liberty with the novel. Her portrayal is interesting and seems to work. There are costume and hair problems, too. Donald Sutherland is miscast. Austen's dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he / she can write like Austen. Brenda Blethyn takes some liberties in making Mrs. Bennet less awful than Austen's portrayal. < br / > < br / > There are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film.",0
Logic is not a great component of this movie.,0
Adults? This is not what you spend your Saturday night on. This movie is simply bad. Hardly. There was a nice score. There was no drive in it. It leaves you with questions when you're finished. Never quite figured who this movie was about. Mickey or Pete. < br / > < br / > The story was just weird. Nothing to really move the story forward.,0
It was not even worth the price of rental.,0
If there was any good scenic shots of Ireland then it would give it another reason to see it.,0
"Unfortunately it had to be this movie. Hugh has romance problems because his girlfriend can't get past his cosmic fascination. Not much. Pete's Meteor. Micky blames him for the death of his parents, though we're never really told what happened or why. Young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother. But like I said before, they don't really go anywhere. < br / > < br / > So the'plot'is disjointed and half of it is pointless.",0
It doesn't work. And the worst is that it is a drama with so much ridiculous and even totally implausible plot. The same thing with other characters.,0
It's totally weird and impossible to string together. This would be a good film for a film class to analyze.,0
"The zero plot or story?... $ $ $ # @ % @! Or the VERY bad acted, teen angst innuendo? the garden - variety college / frat boy - esquire scenes of towel slapping? And where do I begin? This movie was Flippin Awful.... My god, It NEVER ended!.....",0
This new guy wants everyone's power for himself. A very mediocre action movie.,0
! Or better yet download it so you don't waste your money.,0
3. Guys - don't go to see it. Expression number one : sad. Wooden acting. There is no plot. Must be awful to go on a date sweating like that. The main character only has two expressions on his face. THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!,0
< br / > < br / > And to Mr. DeNiro. You used to make serious films. It's dead on the screen.,0
Very disappointing for me. Whatever it was that made The Lost boys so likable was obviously absent here. Altho it tried hard. More of a serial pilot than an actual movie. I wanted to like this movie but just could not find anything to like about it.,0
"For sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job. They also happen to be a part of the secret sect called "" The Covenant "". < br / > < br / > The movie has it's moments, but overall was a little disappointing.",0
"In any public school, these kids would be beaten up every day. The predictable stuff happens. < br / > < br / > So what was the movie all about? But if they use their powers too often, they become prematurely old and feeble. Three teenagers acting out with each other and their girlfriends.",0
1 its like saying that that movie was close which it isn't.,0
"Oh yeah Case in point, don't bother with this movie, really, don't. At least I hope that was the intention and their taste isn't that bad! The story was so basic that it could have been summed up in about 15 minutes, maximum. I watched it all the way to the bitter end, hoping it would eventually offer me more enjoyment.",0
"< br / > < br / > Hollywood : "" Now that sounds original. This was a movie best left on the cutting room floor. Oooh, rich kids and their problems... let me pretend to care.",0
"God this movie sucks... where was I? < br / > < br / > Not since Uwe Boll's Alone in the Dark did i ever feel that the special effects in a movie were totally wasted. Oh and if something needs explaining, don't worry, someone will explain it all in one large piece of dialog. Yeah there's girls in it who sit on their beds in their panties or whatever, but how come they don't take their shirts off? oh yeah, the ascension part. That explains why they got people in their late 20'to play 17 year old's.",0
"The Backstreet Boys, perhaps? Seriously now. Or was it N'Synch? No one really knows how the Power came to be. I couldn't. "" Is this a horror movie or a film for teenie - boppers? And this is one of the teeniest I've seen so far.",0
Wow! The characters are all gross underdeveloped. The acting really was that bad.,0
That was a fine film.,0
Some movies go directly to DVD. This is a disaster movie in the real meaning of that term.,0
"Then there was a girl talk PJ party. then it could be worth it. or go see it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. - who farted? I believe it would have, had there been more than 20 people in the theater. but don't expect anything breathtaking. it was a ford commercial for around 1 / 4th of the movie. your just normal after, right?",0
"Life's hard when you're a fifteen year old who likes art house. ! It bored me to tears. Even my friend, who usually laps us crap films, hated it.",0
"If you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects, and / or mindlessly fun plots, this movie is for you. 5 for the opening sequence - - I'm a sucker for stylish compositing and flashy title design. 5 for the stupid sound track, + 0. < br / > < br / > Story / Script : + 1 for decent main idea, - 0. Lots of boys fighting in the style of DBZ and Street Fighter. < br / > < br / > Conclusion : This is not a "" film, "" this is a MOVIE. There's really nothing to analyze, it'just good, ( relatively ) clean fun. Lots of really attractive actors and actresses.",0
"Oh boy. He made his choices and we have to feel bad for him? In the movie, Rommel mentions how Hitler had changed from before. Films like this really bother me.",0
"What made him so successful? I hoped to learn something from this movie, but I was disappointed. There is some good action here and there, but not much.",0
"< br / > < br / > Mason is fine as Rommel, but it's hardly a memorable performance along the lines of, say, George C. Scott as Patton. And that's probably true. Of course, Rommel wasn't as colorful as Patton, but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting. < br / > < br / > But this film goes out of its way to portray him as a near - saint. If only Hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in Africa, the argument goes, things would have gone very differently. Rommel was, in fact, a military genius, and by all accounts an upstanding, honest man.",0
"Such real life people just don't make good movie material. Rommel, for example, is perceived here not just as a German but as a typical Southerner "" from Baden - Württemberg. The open holster and the revolver with the mother of pearl grips are clearly visible! For me this movie was a disappointment.",0
"Perhaps it's just me, but this movie seemed more like sequel or follow - up than the separate project. Why?",0
This is a stupid movie. To show fortitude? I stayed to the bitter end.,0
"Will they bumble their way through their problems? But, it is all for naught, as plot is wandering and weak. He goes off in roller blades after the garbage truck.",0
It's just a sad stupid mess.,0
I vaguely remember this film. !,0
Even kids hate this movie.,0
"Look for something else... It turned out to be quite a pig. The plot line - such as it is - was disjointed, inconsistent and predictable.",0
"There are better movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I actually had to leave. Probably. Anyway, this film is awful. There is nothing to like about it.",0
Nuff said. This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie I have ever seen.,0
"< br / > < br / > It works with good movies too. And that's what makes it great. The point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. < br / > < br / > The defenders and haters of this film are right : It's STUPID, and that's the point.",0
Nothing new in this movie. LOL. I just saw this movie.,0
"Whatever. And what's with the Channing Tatum "" hotness "" that all the girls talk about? I was actually laughing because I was so embarrassed watching it. It's a bunch of junk! The movie was pathetic.",0
This God awful movie custom made for dull - normal adolescents. The plot very closely follows'You've Got Served. ',0
"THERE WERE ONLY 3 DANCE SEQUENCES IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE AND 2 OF THEM WERE TAKEN STRAIGHT FROM THE COMMERCIAL. all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character. the actors cannot act. Channing Tatum is NOT by any means a b - boy. EVER. perhaps i'm being overly critical because i am a dancer, but maybe thats what needs to be heard.",0
"LOL! 5 rating, I bet it's those Channing lovers! < br / > < br / > Well, you know those movies I just mentioned up top? Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead, and Save the Last Dance?",0
It is worth watch if you like that kind of film.,0
"Then again, that doesn't say much, does it? = Going into the movie with the right expectations, I somewhat liked this movie.",0
"This film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver. Again, not a bad film to waste a little time that involves NO thinking on. Indeed, it was not. Well, not much here in way of horror or suspense. Some of the lines and situations are funny. Michael Berryman, from The Hills Have Eyes, also has a brief but interesting cameo in the film.",0
Let'get real here. This is an awful movie.,0
It feels like especially De Niro doesn't enjoy being in Showtime.,0
"It's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. """,0
Some are re - hashed from other movies. < br / > < br / > The comedic timing is terrible. Some jokes are telegraphed.,0
"It is. I'd love to see someone remake this one. < br / > < br / > The "" Mysteries "" evoked by the book are not well - translated onto screen.",0
The mysteries in the book seemed to be chopped up or left out in the movie.,0
"She's not very good at that type of thing. Bergen, although stunning, should NOT put on a British accent EVER. After seeing her in the likes of A WOMAN IS A WOMAN and A BAND APART, her presence here is quite jarring.",0
What on earth were they doing making the American president relatively sane? Forget this abysmal film and get hold of the TV series instead. What an utter disappointment.,0
Apocalypse.,0
I know. I'm not saying that anything Yes! It was a bad film. Why they had to fool him? the film stars Billy Dee Williams as Gabrielle's Union's brother. He didn't want anything to do with that.,0
This movie is absolutely horrible!,0
"It's just a mess. That said, this movie was pretty bad.",0
< br / > < br / > The thing that really got me was Eddie Murphy's character. So these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras around. Other than that I can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. < br / > < br / > Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. He's undercover and Murphy is part of his backup.,0
A whole new meaning! I's a big struggle.,0
"It's a guarantee you'll forget it, not too long after watching it. Huh. Everything else is below - par and almost comes off grating. Such pain!",0
"What a skunker. I bought this movie based on some other reviews I'd read. There were no scenes that were horrifying, even remotely. I wish I had my money back. The plot is boring and stupid.",0
"I was disappointed. Then the ending made no sense. The reason for this black ooze as we find out was pretty bad, ants? Unbelieveable!",0
"it is just a joke. ! anyway, the script IS terrible. and the ending... the ending!?!?",0
This horror tale takes place in the Namib Desert of Africa. During a long cold desert night a shape - shifting monster makes its appearance.,0
"The other two dimwits are not seen alive again. The main lunatic in the group, Karl, decides that they must find the killer. The dumbest guy in this group had picked up a bunch of bones using his jacket to carry them around. something eats him. Spoilers : The dumbest one starts hitting the mound with a pick, and cracks it open. Bairstow is supposed to join Camp C and help them find diamonds. ).",0
It is not even worth seeing.,0
This movie made me dumber. ) < br / > < br / > ( SPOILER ALERT!!!! Pretty cliche eh? Give me break.,0
But it still didn't surprise me. The chick of the movie is such a cliché.,0
"You got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous. One line says it all : "" Who doesn't want to be on TV? "" Murphy was a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleeting. You can say that De Niro is actually playing himself asking : "" Why would I do another movie playing a cop? "" Early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks : "" How is this different from Cops? That's when I saw it in a new light that I hadn't previously noticed. The action sequences are nothing special, except the end which required a lot of effort both from cast and crew. < br / > < br / > As for Murphy.",0
In conclusion i found this film about as exciting as watching paint dry. This is another Alien imitation and not a very good one at that. Their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilisation while being stalked by the monster.,0
I gave it a 4 / 10. So I cannot recommend this movie.,0
"However, it gets rather boring rather quick at the end. The acting is fairly good, as is the location and the story starts out rather well too. Still it wasn't all bad, it just needed more horror less hunting and more chomping.",0
"The ant - creature has infrared - vision and crumbles when shot at, yawn! Wulfsohn tries too hard to make his monster look like the outer space menaces of "" Alien "" and "" Predator "". Avoid. The characters all are insufferable stereotypes that act and say exactly what you predict several minutes in advance. This could have been a modest gem, but instead it'less than mediocre. The movie actually just benefits from its unique setting and the handful of nasty images of decomposed bodies.",0
"But they don't. That's it. Unfortunately, the very cool concept becomes Alien in the Desert very quickly. And we get every monster movie cliché ever made. How about almost non - existent?",0
"No - one should ever have to see this abomination. It's really not worth the plastic it's made of. Please, for good of humanity. "".",0
This movie has no redeeming factors.,0
"Being a former MST3k watcher, even I found this movie unwatchable. The awful attempts at humor - heck the awful attempts at acting. Nobody needs to read a harangue on this piece of junk. Watch at your own risk.",0
I doubt this movie is in a very wide - distribution. I would think you could get that from the title. I can't even remember why I saw this film or when.,0
"Simply because he has a goal? < br / > < br / > But this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic. Alas, it was not to be. I watched "" Deadly Voyage "" because David Suchet was in it, after enjoying him in the "" Poirot "" series. Why should the audience be expected to care about Kingsley?",0
This is one odd film.,0
"Sadly, the rest of the movie is something of a comedy. or as a dancer on DICK CLARK'S AMERICAN BANDSTAND. Strange movie.",0
"< br / > < br / > The worst part of the film was the ending. I'm sorry! Afterwards they sent him to Siberia. Well, let's think of the book. In the end we have the "" guilty "" Dimitrij Karamazov. It never should be film in two hours that's impossible.",0
The score here is bland too. Who really cares whether or not the show goes on?,0
"After building a fire, he decides to kiss her. To make matters worse, the Douglas brothers have a "" dark history "" which is revealed before any mystery is built up regarding the matter. < br / > < br / > The "" romance "" is played too innocently for as obvious an attracted man and woman as Burlinson and Ms. Thornton. Observe, for example, the "" Jessica is lost "" sequence of events. Hero Burlinson discovers damsel. The main attraction, herein, is the Australian scenery.",0
< br / > < br / > It's bobbins. Dreadful! Less funny than global warming.,0
"Yes, it's quaint, and certainly a product of its time, but as a film it's only two notches above worthless. Then there's John Carpenter's Dark Star.",0
"With audience sympathy skewed, the film loses its narrative progression. The plot here is simple.",0
"What I can not forgive, though, is extreme boredom. Also, don't get fooled by the title, the film is not gory at all. Bad performances, however, are something I can easily forgive in films like this one. * * * BIG SPOILERS! This has the wide reputation of being an awful stinker, and rightly so, I must say.",0
"The character's are one dimensional idiots & have no personality, I didn't like anyone in this film.",0
"Can't miss, right? What interested hippies? Asia, philosophy, pacifism, and wild sets and costumes.",0

"It just meandered along to the end. It was a waste of talent, film, their time, and mine.",0
It's slower than watching grass grow!,0
Hate it.,0
Hate it. I've seen more life in a wooden spoon. It was like she was reading from an autocue.,0
"Overall I would pass, but I guess it's worth a watch if you have nothing absolutely better to do. Rest of cast are OK as well. It's well made and decently written, and it started out really interesting, but it just couldn't keep up the pace, plus I found the ending to be disappointing.",0
"< br / > < br / > Now I also mentioned the songs - - egad, those terrible songs! After all, the plot is lovely and is still hidden beneath all the goo. So why did they decide to add a bazillion songs that did nothing to help the film? Now Van was not the only bad casting decision in the film - - he was just the most obvious. ! Why did I hate Van so much?",0
"Oh, yes, and he's a runaway. Hmm. """,0
Slaughter Trail is a B western with some grand pretensions. But it's come down in Hollywood history for a most ignominious reason. Needless to say Terry never got to be a singing cowboy. < br / > < br / > It's a great act Grey and Young pull off.,0

"Surprising for Fritz Lang is the unevenness of tone. Hitchcock totally reversed the ratio, using comic relief to occasionally pace suspense.

"Just turn the big crank, and out comes the product. The idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money at a movie and hire enough big names, then a good story and good writing aren't necessary.

"Household's little novel is one of the all - time great suspense classics, taut and spare, with only a bare handful of characters to propel the action. Which brings me to my bitterest complaint : Household's hunter is so quintessentially British, he would bleed a Union Jack if you cut him. Remake soon with subtlety and with, please! Thorndyke? "" He looked about right in the role, and was a fine actor for the 1940s, but as Rogue Male's reluctant hero? But Walter Pigeon, who plays him, is Canadian! I'll assume you've already read a synopsis of the story, and proceed to my complaints.",0
I nearly said film but that would be going a step too far. Where do we start with an offering like this?,0
He has no motives. The film is absent of all tension or any major conflict. Turns up unexpectedly and inexplicably. He escapes death by the slimmest of margins. The villain is featured in maybe three scenes. The threat and tension is constant.,0
"Too bad! The spin simply continues in flashback mode to Paris.

"This film was not it. Her constant whining voice grated the nerves! Nolte's accent made Jefferson sound like an ignorant man, rather than a genius.",0
"This is the way he was, the film seems to say. To her credit, Maria sees through his brazen lies immediately. I've not changed toward you, he insists, offering weak excuses for not writing. Jefferson in Paris "" is a truly confounding film. Jefferson damns himself further when Maria, tired of waiting for his letters, travels from England to see him. < br / > < br / > If her behavior is an attempt to excuse Jefferson's, it doesn't work.",0

If you have ever wanted to know more about cab drivers, then this is an excellent movie to watch, for informational purposes only. < br / > < br / > I'll admit, there were a couple of funny bits here and there. Paul Dillon plays the cab driver in Chicago who is working all day. Some of Jim Carrey's movies have stuff added as they go along and they always do well at the box offices. At least with no planning whatsoever, there is always the element of surprise to be found. I can just hear it now, "" Wait, just wait a second!",0

"( There are so many homosexual undertones between Danny and Bix. ) Now, this film's basic premise seemed promising enough. Because Carrie gets murdered by the town creep, because Bix is too gay to commit. All I can say is, thank God for Joel and the Bots. ! Because they turned this horse hockey into one of my favorite MST3K episodes.",0
Carrie is killed and Bix is immediately blamed? The Girl in Lovers Lane is one strange little low - budget film. Elam had creepy down pat!,0
"The riffing is dead - on, all the time. Bix starts seeing Carrie but he plans on leaving soon ( because he's a drifter, see? He's no good! Eventually, Bix and Danny decide to leave town but trouble is a - brewing, due to Jesse the creep. ).",0

The idea is trite. The rest left me cold.,0
"In the next scene, the girls are about 15. and start a new life. < br / > < br I guess that's enough of the plot to scare most people away. And what a military base it is. They're driving with their parents and hit a deer. The story is not cohesive AT ALL.",0

I found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic. I found myself asking'Would a normal adult do that?,0

"'Game Over'did have a couple of interesting ideas though. Also, this film tries to bring in a bizarre theory. Boy was I wrong and misguided by a mile. Kasparov had suspicions about this, but still to this day there is no evidence. After watching it, I am sad to say, I felt like I wasted my time.",0
"The most generic, surface - level biography you could hope for.",0
"i also found it very dry and slow. this is just my opinion, of course. who cares? ultimately this movie was unsatisfying. i am a chess fan, and i only stuck it out because of that.",0
"Kasparov thought then, and still does, that IBM cheated. That game psyched him out so much that he was unable to recover, and after playing games 3, 4, and 5 to draws, lost game 6 horribly.",0
"I watched the 1997 Kasparov - Deep Blue games on the Internet. Not only does Kasparov believe this, but the filmmakers seem to believe it too. I'm writing this note as a chess player as well as as a movie viewer. I know something about the issues that were raised. There was a man inside it.",0
That's where focus should have been. Could / would IBM let Kasparov see'inside'the machine? This just looked like filler. What was the final score? The nub of the film was the play in game two.,0
Good luck. I even liked the theme music.,0
Yes!,0

"< br / > < br / > As for rest... it's a dirty, dirty mess. The result was such pure schlock that it was never given a release. He doesn't get many decent lines, but when he does he hits them.

I'm not a huge fan of the Fantastic Four, but I'm fairly familiar with them. < br / > < br / > First, I'd just like to mention that despite everything that went bad in this movie, I actually sort of liked the guy that played Doom. For one thing they have no reason for Sue and Johnny to go into space. I am almost a two decade old human who's been reading comics most of my life. He's not overacting, he's ultracting. It only stands to make their eventual romantic pairing a helluva lot creepier. Still, copies exist, mostly on the net and at conventions. The armor looks pretty good too.",0
"The dialog is so lame and tired it sounds like it was written by a junior high drama class. Let me rephrase that. Then there's poor Ben Grimm ( Michael Bailey Smith ), the lovable lug whose body morphs into a mass of craggy, orange rock. To be fair, THE FANTASTIC FOUR is not as bad as everyone says. He's left with the ability to stretch and contort his body to outrageous lengths. Can our heroes save the day?",0
"Imagine ballerina's, a bright light, then a wolf. And I was correct. I never read the book. < br / > < br / > Just avoid this movie. Now I don't really want to. Period.",0

"At first I was like, okay, so both of her parents are dead... maybe it'll be okay. But then came the rest of the movie.",0
"A devastatingly boring disappointment. All this really consists of is a big leap before they light up and land as a wolf. Very cheezy effects. From the makers of Underworld, we have, by far, the worst werewolf movie I have ever seen. ).",0
"If I'm going to watch a movie for two hours, I'd like to care about somebody or something. Why didn't I care about them? I needed these types of details to better appreciate what they were going through. or what her plans were upon reaching New York. < br / > < br / > And why was Lucy even in this movie? Who were these characters?",0
"Awww. OK, to start with, this movie was not at all like the book. He doesn't die. Astrid and Vivian hate each other. hope helped. What was that about?",0
"My first impression when I read the synopsis for the upcoming movie was that it was going to be very, very different from the book. I pushed that aside and ventured forth into movie, weary and slightly annoyed. She meets Aiden, an aspiring graphic novelist.",0

"The wolves were beautiful animals and well managed in their roles. Even then you'll barely recognize the characterizations. Oh yes, the way the loup garou bow to their leader is pure hoke. Unfortunately, they did not.",0
"Very much like Underworld, only even less interesting. This movie was boring.",0
And movie also shows that ASTRID is VIVIAN'S aunt. And she also dated AIDEN after they broke up. In the book she was 16. That is indeed what it is. I have never seen a hotter man.,0
Then this is the movie to see. Vivian was the one that chased Aden. He is old looking.,0
"In the movie they've become decadent twenty - something clubgoers. This is a wonderful metaphor for the heroine's state : torn between her human and wolf sides, savoring each but equally fearful of both. In the book the characters are in high school - - or in and out, as with the Five, a teen gang who favor black jeans and T - shirts, and fall somewhere between being the heroine's nemeses and her pet peeves. The movie dispenses with the epigraph, and instead introduces the character working in her aunt's chocolate shop!",0
Anyone over that age may suffer and want their hour and a half back. I think I'll just read book and see how I get on. < br / > < br / > PROS : ~ they turn into wolves rather than plastic / cartoony monsters.,0
"totally emotionless. If she was so scared why didn't she get up, turn the knob and leave?! ) Get out! "" This straight to video cheap flick is based on a true story. They don't leave.

A young woman named Angela buys a great, big old country home really really cheap.",0
"It's a shame that this wasn't what it could have been. Unfortunately, the movie falls flat.",0
The nudity in the movie went a bit far.,0
The sexual innuendos he used were juvenile and unnecessary. Hah! This show was an embarrassment to Hollywood. Or can those clowns be embarrassed?,0
"On the second tape. I loved the book, and I knew it couldn't be as bad as people said.",0
"Combined with short low - budget battle scenes, such as the Alamao and San Jacinto, this film is recommended only for real history buffs who who don't come from Mexico. To its credit, the Mexican uniforms look accurate and the romantic subplot ( another love triangle ) doesn't take up too much screen time.",0
"The 75 minute feature CRYSTAL VOYAGER is the result. As a result it was teamed with fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a trippy run through the UK and Europe as a double feature. This created this myth that the film was a huge crowd puller and the reputation spread. In 1974 when the Sydney Opera house opened, it also contained a cinema.",0
But it never ended.,0
The screenplay is horrible.,0
"Category 6 : Day of Destruction will not be remembered for advancing the cause of made - for - TV movies. All in all, I really really dislikes this "" TV event. "" There have been some great television movies in that past.

"Leave this bore alone. Boy, was I wrong.",0
< br / > < br / >,0
"I hope everyone in this "" movie "" dies in the second half. The only problem is it isn't very well done. She is so helpless, in fact, I want to put her out of her and my misery. You got me. This made for TV film is about every cliché you can come up with for a disaster movie.",0
"What a mess - - and I'm not referring to the "" destruction "" in the title.",0
? What were they thinking when they made this movie???? This is just an insult to intelligent viewers everywhere.,0
The digital effects where like a children's cartoon. < br / > < br / > Please keep the special effects real.,0
Well thats what I think of the film. What is this!! A girl got shot?! its so bad.,0
"If you have to see a made - for - TV disaster film, see "" The Day After "", "" Asteroid "", or "" Special Bulletin instead - - you'll get better plots, acting, and effects. You can predict what will happen next, and come close to predicting the dialog, word for word. The special effects are unbelievably bad. Still, some character relationships don't become clear until the second part.",0
This one was truly awful. How could the network of Ed Murrow and Walter Cronkite do such a thing? In prime time?,0
"Combine that with terrible lighting & cinematography & you have a real disaster of a film. ! When I searched her name, up came this relatively new TV movie. In summary - I want those 3 hours of my life back!!",0
"These guys must actually live by this motto, and I am so fed up of it. But wait, there was even a bigger one. Well, Category 6 is worse than that because it assumes to be different and "" original "". With that allure we sat down to watch some mayhem and destruction. What a let down! But we knew this before right?! The script itself was the bigger disaster!",0
"Barf. So he caused a bazillion deathshe meant well. Surebut we watched it, didn't we? It was everything I expected from the commercials, and I'm glad I wasted my time watching it. The real disaster of this movie was the script, especially the ending. Did you count many ads there were for home backup generators during this pig? For example : will they make it to the airport in time?",0
"HELLO. "" I have a hard time buying that. But I guess they also had the money for it.",0
I was laughing all the time. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into one tornado. This movie is something horrible.,0

In this case, the even is the joining of two huge storm systems.",0
"Sadly, no. A wasted effort. Even Sesame Street didn't explain the origins of Mr Snuffleupagus or how Mr Hooper died : we can work it out. < br / > < br / > But maybe there are the special effects to watch.

It's like watching a religious propaganda movie.,0

This was a sordid and dreary mess.,0
This is a terrible movie.,0
"< br / > < br / > Damian is a bad writer and a bad director. And the lame dialogue is fit to put one to sleep. Furthermore, he couldn't get Ellen Barkin to give 110 %.",0
As much as I love Ellen Barkin ( who is really underrated ) I have to boo this movie.,0
What was the motive?,0
I started fast forwarding to see how it ended. It was just flat out boring and completely unrealistic.,0
"We left halfway through because we were bored, frustrated and our ears hurt. I got all the little in - jokes... too bad they weren't funny. My opinion had changed - - it's even WORSE! I give this 1. at a Saturday matinee in my home town.",0
"Both would be a better rental than "" Mercy "" which has next to nothing. It tried to hard to be "" sexy. "" This film tried, but ultimately it was a waste of talent.",0

It could have been a great film if done properly and with careful casting. Not to mention dialogs! Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The editing, photography / camera focus and just about everything about this movie was SAD.",0
D. C. Fontana really blew this one. Still am.,0

"Plus, she puts up a GREAT fight against the killer at the end.",0

"There is not a stitch of humor or meaning to the whole thing ; it just drones on with colored lights.

It was Johnny's and it comes from the original TV series so let me help to set the facts straight.",0
Answer : To can hide the deficiencies of the actors. Everyone overacts to the point of stupidity. Even Conan the Barbarian had some civility. What I saw was one of the worst displays of movie making I've ever seen.,0
Ugh! She's awful.,0
"watch something like'the sword of doom'instead, i hear its much better than this confusing mess of a film. everything she does or says is stupid, and she generally just seems to mess peoples lives up. i've heard a lot about the inventive camera - work and direction in this movie. i thought both were a mess < br / > < br / > also some truly terrible acting.",0
"And Cassell wasn't bad, he was just in a bad movie. < br / > < br / > California Dreaming is just a big old mess. As Jennifer Denuccio used to say on Square Pegs, "" Gag me out the door.

Duke plays a wonderful game of volleyball, the best he's played in over ten years. What he gets is lame surf hijinks. Duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman.",0
"Those reviewers probably have a point. It merely drags on. It is boring. On and on the movie drags with the pointless interaction between the two little girls, with many a dramatic cut away as they pose "" shocking "" questions. Oooh... creepy. Two little girls strike a friendship. One tries to convince the other she's a witch.",0
"Another commenter wrote, "" Watch it if you wanna get scared. "" Based on the plot description, reviews on IMDb, and the 7. That's really about it.",0
"It isn't exactly heroics, but she's suddenly smitten. Please! This is a poor excuse for a movie. So what turns her from despising him to loving him? Yechh. How he ever got talked into taking this job I'll never understand.",0
This was probably clichéd even back in 1942!,0
"Still, Zucco is always fun to watch, even in undemanding piffle such as this. It is a very simple plot, really, and an extremely low - budget production. If you can spare 72 minutes of your life, I suppose you could do worse than "" The Mad Monster "" ( not TOO much worse, of course! You've been warned! ).",0
"We also get the revenge motif from the Devil Bat worked in, in itself a borrowing from Son Of Frankenstein! Pedro is obviously based on Lennie from Of Mice And Men, and you almost keep expecting him to say "" Duh, okay, George! "" Experimenting on Pedro the handyman ( Glenn Strange ) Zucco creates a werewolf that looks rather like the ones Dave Allen used to play in his comedy sketches! However even he couldn't save this dull and flat - footed B flick. George Zucco was a fine actor, often playing gimlet - eyed villains with a lascivious intensity. < br / > < br / > Not one of the better 40s B movies. A few atmospheric swamp scenes are all it has to offer, really.",0
"But beyond Zucco, there's nothing here to recommend. His Dr. Cameron is a regular loony. There are far better examples of Poverty Row horror from the 1940s than The Mad Monster. There's really only one positive I can come up with to write about in The Mad Monster.",0
"If it were not for Zucco and Strange's presence, along with the cute Anne Nagel, this would be completely unwatchable.",0
"Obviously, he has been cast as the loving father, mad scientist, vampire guy. I don't know much about George Zucco, but I've seen him in two movies. This is the typical, "" I will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army. "" I'm surprised that he ended up in the genre. It's not a very good movie. He looks so ordinary. She wants to leave but her father, the doctor, won't allow that.",0
"It's not that I don't like them, just that I don't like them a lot. The story seems to borrow many elements from other big pictures that came before it. But I had this one on one of those 50 movie sets so I thought I'd give it a watch and see how it was. There are reminders of Frankenstein ( 1931, James Whale ) in the creation of a monster which runs amok, and the creature killing an innocent child. First of all, I have to say that I am not generally a big fan of werewolf movies in general.",0
"God "" ( uncredited ) strikes up well - done ending, too. The scientist's daughter Lenora grows wary of her father's actions and shares her suspicions with a newspaper reporter.

After an eyewitness sees the beast and a little girl is killed, the locals grab their rifles and organize a posse to hunt it down. This results in a time - lapse change of man turning into a werewolf. Cameron, who has set up shop deep in the swamp lands of what I'm presuming is the Louisiana bayou, is plotting revenge against four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job.",0
"There are some moody B & W shots here and there that don't completely suck. < br / > < br / > It's not a total waste. He wasn't Karloff, but PRC was lucky to have him. That's the case here.

"Mad Monster "" lacks a cult following more because it is not delightfully bad, just has dull pacing in more than a few spots. There is some good dialogue on how man should not mess with nature ( still prevalent today ) and play God. He uses a simpleton gardener ( Glenn Strange ) to experiment on by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Zucco's motives may be honorable, but his methods are most questionable.",0
"( 4 / 10 ) Usually they looked like this. The Mad Monster "" is no exception to that rule.",0
"However, even good acting couldn't save THE MAD MONSTER. < br / > < br / > The werewolf transformations are classic Hollywood stop - action / makeup effects. His goal is to create an invincible army, which he can control through the antidote.",0
"Like most mad scientist films, this is a weak warning against fooling around with Mother Nature. It doesn't have the power or intellectual challenges of Frankenstein, but it doesn't ever extend its reach anyway.",0
"The casting is deplorable. It makes Mel Brooks movies Oscar - worthy by comparison. Patricia Krenwinkel never sported a "" Dorothy Hamill "" hair style.",0
"I heard legends about this "" film "" ( quotes used so as not to insult films ) for a while, so when I finally got the DVD with it, I impatiently started watching it. Manson Family "" makes the bottom of Troma's entries look like daring and groundbreaking art - house filmwork.",0
"But this "" Manson "" doesn't even look right. The performances were terrible, too. It's symbolic! There's your Manson.",0
"It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time. < br / > < br / > In short, don't bother with this movie.",0
"So I had second dibs on questions, I asked if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock'n roll version and not necessarily the true story. All those other movies are bullsh * *! "" Here's what I have to say about it.",0
"), cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters. The ending comes out of nowhere. Skip it... unless you're experimental 1960s films. HOW is this funny? The movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along. That's about as original as this gets.",0
"Why fourteen years? < br / > < br / > Mais je divage. Later it develops that he was putting it into her coffee as well. Many people have tried nicotine patch and failed. Strikes me as routine, as far as TV movies go. And her eyes become as painful as boils when she applies makeup?",0
I was left feeling shut out.,0
"However, the dialogs sound too composed and awkward. < br / > < br / > This film is great disappointment.",0
). Akerman's direction is both heavy handed and cliched ( how much more cliched can you get than Paris at night? What is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish. The only advantage with this sort of film is that it makes you realise how good Goddard Truffaut really are.,0
"All he wants is his old girlfriend Lacy, played by a young Marcia Gay Harden, back. Almost. Ray and Elliot team up, despite mutual dislike.",0
"I was expecting "" Born to Kill "" to be an exciting, high - tension film noir.",0
"Then, there's also Ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls. Are there any normal characters in the story? Wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex. Well no, of course not!",0
The script is sub - standard ( it's easy to see why Vidal tried to disown it ). The movie should've looked a whole lot better. The problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. The direction is worse.,0
"The climactic (? ) John Gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from Hamlet. Okay Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the guy who played Macro was handsome. The scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part is terrible. I rated this movie a 3 and that was generous.",0
"As it is, they are little more than cyphers. "" His performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing.",0
"Putney Swope "" stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture. Swope decides to alter the face of American advertising. Like most Marx Brothers movies, the plot is thin, providing an excuse for Downey's anecdotal gags, most of which are terrible. < br / > < br / > The chairman of a prestigious Madison Avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting. Everything about this movie reeks with improvisation. "" Each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself.",0
"Well anyway this is really poor film, I doubt if I ` ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film. < br / > < br / > Trivia point. Yes you read that right, a film set in Roman times has a scene with a head chopping giant lawnmower! Well that ` s what you get for renting pirate videos.",0
"as you'd say in splatter - slasher - movie. At least those movies don't pretend to be some artistic masterpiece. Real birth scenes, how hilarious! What? Fine, but why bother us with it? You can say "" Cool! "" Or castration, yeah right, that was fun! Who really wants to see that? And they are shorter. The story of an emperor who can't deal with his power "". Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for such a long time. There's nothing special about it, just cruelty. But here everything is dark, dull and boring.",0
"The argument for this movie from those who like it seems that it is the only film that honestly portrays pagan Rome and it's excesses. What struck me was that it was a porno movie yet it had great thespians like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren in it!!? ? Even the porn in this movie stinks, and through much of this when I wasn't gagging I was just incredibly bored. < br / > < br / > What were these great actors thinking when they got into this. As a semi - film buff, I had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago. This is not a historic film, it isleaze.",0
"< br / > < br / > What an awful movie. ), and I can see why. Both are terribly awful, of course. < br / > < br / > How true.",0
"( That style of movie - making was out of favour in the late seventies ). Both'The Fall of the Roman Empire'and'Gladiator'were set during the reign of Commodus, an Emperor quite as cruel and licentious as Caligula. I do, however, question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in Roman history.",0
I know I was. The book of Mark no less.,0
"I hate this film due to many reasons, but particularly one. I sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch. I am aware that a movie may be controversial but I had never expected that CALIGULA would go that far in removing all limits of taste. CALIGULA shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked, decadent manner. However, it was not that horrific to the middle. Yes, it is true. Some say that the Rome under Caligula'reign was so brutal.",0
"There, I've wasted enough lines on one of truly worst films of all time - period! Are they in - or outside? complete with a grainy, cheapish photo quality. Have they changed scenes?",0
"Not the least practitioner of these was Caligula. I have also been fascinated by the mad excesses of many of these princes of Rome. He does have Macro killed and many others who were his originally supporters. His perversities with his sisters do begin here, if not before. This brings me to reviewing this film. Him seen talking to the statue of Jupiter as an equal doomed him.",0
"After a while, all the nudity, hip thrusting and nipple sucking becomes tedious due to sheer repetition. O'Toole seems to be treating the script with the contempt it deserves ( surely he's in it purely for the money?! The performances are totally undisciplined, particularly McDowell who throws caution to the wind and gives a performance that is all wild - eyed posturing. The sex in the film isn't used as one aspect in a multi - layered story - the sex IS the story. ).",0
Lots of questions asked... and then dropped.,0
"In it, sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination. We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. The sex, after the initial shock and astonishment fades, only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture. < br / > < br / > Caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick. Rarely has a film proved so boring.",0
"And then there's the violence.... < br / > < br / > If you are about to see the film be prepared. But don't be fooled, these scenes don't ease or take focus away from the hideousness of this film. This is only objective this movie achieved.",0
"And no doubt John Gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen. Some describe CALIGULIA as "" the "" most controversial film of its era. What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.",0
"The way Cooper kept shouting "" Alvin! < br / > < br / > I was totally underwhelmed by the "" acting "". Keener doesn't even try to sound like an Alabama native. ), they turn Perry Smith into this oh - so - sensitive victim, even as he's shown dispatching the Clutters.",0
"Drear beyond belief. What was the point of making the film, then? Hardly.",0
there is no there there. he is committed to the performance. i am sure others will have other interpretations. < br / > < br / > Hoffman does go all out. and again?,0
"This is one dreary, inert, self - important bore. Why he is this way is never explained and we get scant background information. The difference, however, is that Smith was fun to watch while Capote is not.",0
Probably not. Does anyone care?,0

"Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves. There's also a very prosaic, dare I say it British feel to the filming. < br / > < br / > It's really rather messy though.",0
