Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. What a pity that it isn't!,1
Bolt isn't.,1
His character is more malevolent than usual. The take on lawyers is also superb. Brilliant over - acting by Lesley Ann Warren. Three funny words.,1
"Sure, its flawed.",1
"< br / > < br / > It rates a 7. But this isn't a thriller, per se.",1
"The direction is good. However, the core plot is very engaging.",1
"She is that good. It's overkill. Ms. Oh is correct saying Collette might be, "" you know, like that guy from'Psycho '. "" The film would benefit from a re - editing - how about a "" director's cut ""?",1
< br / > < br / > What is it about celebrities and fans? ( Dir : Patrick Stettner ) < br / > < br / > Hitchcockian suspenser gives Williams a stand - out low - key performance.,1
"< br / > < br / > This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend. It's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it's scary too. Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like "" Little Miss Sunshine "".",1
< br / > < br / > S ~ PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE! Robin Williams touches darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people. He has the 1940's leading man looks and screen presence.,1
I liked the film.,1
"It is here, a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help. * * * Perhaps its because his show is losing it's authentic veneer which causes Noon to admit he is no longer himself. Instead, this may prove to be one of William's more serious performances.",1
"It is not a Hitchcockian thriller. Everyone is very believable. In fact, the entire cast was very good.",1
Neither is it a predictable movie. This is no americanized movie. I can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before.,1
"This movie needs to have a Director's cut that tries to fix these problems. Not cheap, just hokey. Also, it needed a little more suspense.",1
Sandra Oh also starred as Williams'friend. 8 / 10 Recommended. Toni Collette also stars.,1
"It's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn't sew - up any of plot openings or back - story. That's good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear. < br / > < br / > He also acquaints himself with Pete's guardian, a woman named Donna ( Toni Collette, brilliant! )",1
The book is probably better. The production felt rushed and holes are apparent.,1
I absolutely LOVED this film!,1
"So there are no flashy endings or earth - shattering revelations, no "" showdown "" scenes. This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying. Thank Heaven.",1
"This is a thriller, not a horror, and it should be approached as such. Excellent direction? Great plot? Oh Yes.",1
"What the two films have in common is the action sequences, which are flat - out excellent.",1
This is the token moody period Gothic horror entry from the bunch. A real campy hoot.,1
"Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life - size dolls that terrorize the guests. He dies early in the film ( or does he? ) I won't go into too much detail here, but it is definitely a must - see for fans old dark house mysteries.",1
Aro Tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a Mission in Guatemala in the 70's.,1
"That is why, though having good critics, his movies never caught the broad audience attention. < br / > < br / > Recommended.",1
An act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced. The one we are witness of - the movie. There's so many things to fall for in Aro Tolbukhin.,1
The acting was wonderful. I give THE FALLEN ONES 9 OUT OF 10.,1
Without Kirsten Miller this project needn't have been completed.,1
"Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. Out of a possible 100 % I give this film a mere 71 %. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film.",1
You won't regret it. < br / > < br / > The acting is superb.,1
There is nothing wrong with this movie. Apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time. Titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st Century.,1
< br / > < br / > Having picked the DVD up for a mere $ 3. SEVEN years apart? $ 10. More a case of intrigue! Hardly evidence of the film's relentless pulling - power!,1
"Is a single one of them bad? I usually enjoy movies that stimulate mind, or give me a visual thrill. This movie isn't exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral at all. Not that Titanic has none of that. It's a damn good movie. The melodrama was quite heavy - handed at times. What's inexplicable? But that might be it, the appeal of it.",1
"0. They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in "" Titanic "". 2 % 10 ratings and 9. Big Top Pee - wee "" ( 1988 ) got 4. com users. 0 rating by imdb. Everyone has, and is entitled to, his / her own taste. While 29.",1
It was so touching and beautiful.,1
"Could it get better? A landmark. Guaranteed! The acting was the real effect. Why so criticised? It will be almost impossible. Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. The movie Titanic makes it much more then just a "" night to remember. """,1
"Bethany Cox. 5 / 10. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. Overall, I give Titanic 8.",1
We get a love story on a sinking boat. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. The story is simple and it works. com / ojhoyn ). Oh yes! She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic.,1
The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on - screen couple.,1
"Go see it twice if you want, Its worth it!! ! It was a good risk. Good story, good flow, good actors!!!",1
"Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie. It has its problems ( what movies don't ) but still, it's enjoyable. The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Titanic has to be one of my all - time favorite movies.",1
They trusted each other. Titanic is a classic. When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. Titanic is a great film down to it's very core.,1
Highly recommended.,1
My heart won't go on from this one. No exceptions. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The music has become iconic and legendary.,1
"Was it worth the hype? Was that Leonardo's real nose? 101 - year - old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the Heart of Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re - watch the film. 99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now.",1
One for ages.,1
"She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic. Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal ( Billy Zane ). The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.",1
"< br / > < br / > Personally, I LOVE this film. The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! ha! PEOPLE make the film a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was in awe.",1
"It was so great, "" she said. "" Then - the details. I never watched it in the theatre. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. "" I loved it! Nonsense, "" I thought. First - the directing.",1
It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. The rest of us who deeply love this movie don't care what you think. How lame is that?,1
"Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. I was utterly transfixed. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film. < br / > < br / > This film is one memorable scene after another. How anyone can say effects were bad is beyond me. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. I cried again.... in all the same places. Rose and Jack at the bow, "" flying "". "" Iceberg, right ahead! """,1
"I am not a parent, neither am I a male. Because it portrays values that are important in life. He should be offered more serious roles.",1
But Morphe It just may be haunted. A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film. The tracking and the cuts need to be slow.,1
"Yes it touched my heart. Warning, get the Kleenex ready. Daniell Steel's Daddy, what a refreshing story. Movie's. How disappointing to have it end.",1
"A must see for those who care about their families. One man, Daddy, has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity.",1
"< br / > < br / > Boy, was I wrong! Steamy ""? It's 1968. Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much. I was prepared for disappointment.",1
"Fine acting and directing. A beautiful piece of work!!! Excellent!!! This is a film.., not porn. A romantic.",1
The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone. This is a movie I will show to my children.,1
lol. She was such a great actor for being so little. < br / > < br / > The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble.,1
"Even after he reluctantly takes her back, he's not too upset when she's kidnapped. Wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status, though, that I did, too. < br / > < br / > The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context. What held my attention in The King of Masks was the grimness of the setting : small - town China in the 1930's.",1
The acting is inspired. They were not conventional in real.,1
Watch it 9 / 10. Very impressive. It just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face. Actors are brilliant. The whole film is in loops. 'Kolya'was just OK and about'English patient'lesser said the better.,1
< br / > < br / > Loved the music.,1
Wow.,1
Casting is great. Images are memorable.,1
"Soon, Wang discovers a fact about Doggie that threatens rare and dying art. The story is absorbing.",1
"< br / > < br / > Maybe I'm reading too much into this film ; but I don't think so! Even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war, this could still be any time in the past 150 years. < br / > < br / > But don't get me started on that...",1
"King of Masks ( Bian Lian in China ) is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film. < br / > < br / > The film was so astonishingly good, the acting was amazing, and the issues were so weighty and well - addressed. Wang Bianlian's story goes on from there.",1
This movie was excellent.,1
< br / > < br / > A welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies.,1
"But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. If you can find this series, give it a look. Heinlein's political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is present. < br / > < br / > Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein. And I think they did pretty well with this. ), but it's far superior to the film.",1
"Thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama, and few will leave this DVD behind with a dry eye. Highly recommended : - ) 9 / 10 stars.",1
< br / > < br / > Solidly acted by the principals.,1
"Fans of Farewell My Concubine should look carefully at Master Liang's portrayal of a male playing female role in Chinese Opera. < br / > < br / > In this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the King of Masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art. All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art. Farewell, my Concubine, The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples. But the son eventually is found out to be a girl. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader.",1
dvdbeaver.,1
"Kudos all around. "" Masks "" is a moving film that works on many levels.",1
"Highly recommended. It's a tale that could have taken place anywhere really, given the right circumstances. What a shame. Despite the times and the influences, the man is kind and good. It was weak, cliche and about as subtle as aledgehammer. The aging entertainer finds / buys a male child to pass his art to.",1
The faces of the actors are marvelous to see. The story is simple.,1
"It might sound like your usual sci - fi - series, but it's not! OK, let's get this clear. A round device that creates a wormhole. I find that great.",1
< br / > < br / > The director used this film to criticize the problem of re - embracing tradition by contemporary China and this is the deeper meaning behind movie.,1
"As a result, the film evokes strong empathy for, and feelings about, the characters. < br / > < br / > The story is fun, emotional, and complex. There is also humour, sometimes quite subtle, at appropriate points.",1
"The rest of the story is how the two manage after that. Until it comes out on widescreen, rent it. This deserves a lot better treatment.",1
It may just change you forever once you have seen it. You truly see depths and heigths of human existence in this film.,1
< br / > < br / > Cheers. 5 ) at the 3rd Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival.,1
One of my favorite guilty pleasures. In color too!,1
"... or type on a computer keyboard, they'd probably give this eponymous film a rating of "" 10. """,1
Atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons. 10 / 10,1
"Her shape and way she moves is distinct from Taylor's. All the supporting players round it out, and I do wonder who trained all those elephants. < br / > < br / > Speaking of the stone - Buddha sequence, you really can discern that it's Vivien Leigh in the long shots.",1
"Dana Andrews - - a favorite in "" Laura "" and "" The Best Year of Our Lives "" - - is wasted as Elizabeth's frustrated admirer. The real star is the bungalow, one of most beautiful interior sets in movie history.",1
This is the nexus of the film : what will animals do to get water ; what will humans do to get power or love? To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film : the hubris of man.,1
I have never forgotten it. My parents took me to this movie when I was nine years old.,1
"Most, if not all, of these cops are borderline (? ) The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. psychopaths and neurotics, giving new meaning to the phrase "" loose cannons "". Highly recommended.",1
Buaku rules. The subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant. I do have some complaints though.,1
"Seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them, they're not very well liked by the people. Oh the insanity! the Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence.",1
< br / > < br / > Stargate SG - 1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly. Or couch for that matter either. Stick with it and you'll see what I'm talking about. Fact : Stargate SG - 1 is a cheesy sci - fi TV series. < br / > < br / > There's no escaping facts.,1
"Scott Bartlett's'OffOn'is nine minutes of pure craziness. In a sense, the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology. < br / > < br / > There appears to be some confusion about the film's release date. Either way, the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time, occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video, and some brisk techno music wouldn't have gone amiss, either!",1
It amazed me. That is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of time. This was'nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned. It shocked me.,1
A must - see movie for anyone who likes anime.,1
Kay Kyser's mysteries would be a good example. Hope it is not lost Don't know if that was true.,1
They had to be that good to play that demented.,1
You cannot not be impressed by this movie. He is also the'guru'of Om Puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble. The dialogues by Vijay Tendulkar is also great.,1
"My God what a natural expressions she carried!!! Directed by Govind Nihalani, this is definite cop film of Indian cinema. A man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father.",1
It was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released. Each one played their part par excellence. He played as an inspector - turned - alcoholic character.,1
"< br / > < br / > The film tells the Real - life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. His father is a harsh Police Constable. At many scenes, the film has Hair - raising moments. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's Atrocities on his mother. Finally he gets suspended. This leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired Job - satisfaction. Ardh Satya "" is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema. < br / > < br / > The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch.",1
"An absolute classic! The direction is flawless, the acting is just superb. The most definitive movie on Mumbai Police. ! This movie has stood the test of times. Words fall short for this great work.",1
This is a very good and a classic film. This was Sadashiv Amrapurkars acting debut.,1
I love this show! Its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other. There are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion. < br / > < br / > I say though that it turned out just fine. Maybe even better. show in the history of film / TV.,1
"< br / > < br / > The film tries mighty hard to do a one - up on the poem. "". Is the needle on the center a half - truth? "" Any story comprises a premise, characters and conflict.",1
Expect a documentary made after Wood's own heart.,1
Still it's of interest if you're a Wood fan. Do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker? It is interesting ( somewhat ) but was this really needed?,1
"Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr. fan, I prefer to appreciate his "" boundless enthusiasm "" and acknowledge his shortcomings. His movies are fun, but his personal story is one racked with pain. < br / > < br / > Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies, and new comers will be amazed that this man was real. The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background. We get insight into Ed's personal and professional life : from his romances, to his drinking, to his sexuality, to his friends, to his enemies, and even to his film making.",1
Best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater.,1
A great film!,1
"The story of a drifter, his sheep ranch boss, and the boss's daughter is not for all tastes, but it's still very intriguing. The cast also contains Bruno Lawrence, who is probably best remembered by American audiences from the film "" Smash Palace "". < br / > < br / > Sharply acted, with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads.",1
"Never before seen such a sick and twisted thing. I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza, this one I saw about 2 years ago and it really fu * * ed my head. ! The Story is good and the actors do their thing very well.",1
"And this isn't that nice cool, clean violence so beloved of US cinema - this stuff is nasty, painful and HURTS! Anyone new to the incredibly prolific Takashi Miike's work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director.",1
He is just hilarious! ! Daniel's starting to catch up on him to!,1
"Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, later moved back into Japan, and alienated for it. And Tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he's forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother.",1
"If thats not your cup of tea, proceed with caution. There are also semi - graphic depictions of gay sex. < br / > < br / > 7 or 8 out of 10.",1
Another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences. One of the problems is the cultural / language one.,1
< br / > < br / > Should you see this film? YES It is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of Asian cinema. Why?,1
"Shinjuku Triad Society, albeit from perfect, is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber - conventional realm.",1
"The kid brother is a lawyer, and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one, as the movie progresses. The movie takes place in a very harsh environment, and is therefore pretty violent and tough. If you've only seen Miikes far - out movies ( Ichi the killer, Fudoh etc. )",1
"I don't want to give away too much. < br / > < br / > I cannot sing Shinjuku's praises enough. But, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. Shinjuku is however, one of Miike's most perfectly formed films. ( Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that. )",1
"Nevertheless, the point is this a fine start to a great show. Keep watching, first season is a blast! ! This was the beginning of it all!",1
"I hope we see the Friends reunite! The acting in this episode isn't great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters ( apart from Kudrow and Perry - who shine ). < br / > < br / > The Episode is better than most people give credit for, like any new sitcom the first episode isn't always fantastic. he cannot speak normally! but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons, but he isn't confident.",1
"Because that's where "" Friends "" is based : on quotes. And that's how the greatest comedy of TV started! ENJOY FRIENDS!",1
"This, in turn means even more on - world episodes, which is perfectly understandable. Stargate SG - 1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie "" Stargate. "" I am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject. But still, top notch science fiction! Some episodes are on - world, meaning that they don't go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on Earth. < br / > < br / > My rating : 8. Any Gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a "" System Lord. """,1
The pilot is extremely well done. It displays remarkable creativity on the writers part. < br / > < br / > Bravo.,1
Thanks for the assistance.,1
"< br / > < br / > Ps : I just loooove Joey's and Chandler's haircuts in this first season! = ) But in reality, he was just deceiving her. < br / > < br / > Ross, for the other hand, discovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for Susan, her partner.",1
Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film. Why did it sound like the husband kept calling her Appy? It ruined a great episode and so I can only give it a 6.,1
"Abby's life is saved, just.",1
Corbin Bernsen also chews up scenery playing a not - so - good - guy who gets his just desserts. < br / > < br / > End of Spoiler.,1
"I think he enjoys to watch women been burn, torture, mutilated and I don't know.",1
Cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife Abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially. It's violent and gory with a sick & twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences.,1
"Well its about time. In "" Right To Die "" we are treated to the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation.",1
"Then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of "" Hellraiser 2 "". A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident. Great acting, great plot, great dialogue, great suspense.",1
"In ninth season a new villain emerges, the Ori. Col. Jack O'Neill ( Anderson ), Dr. Daniel Jackson ( Shanks ), Capt. Stargate SG - 1 follows and expands upon the Egyptian mythologies presented in Stargate. For millennia, the Goa'uld harvested humanity, heavily influencing and spreading human cultures. Throughout the first eight seasons, the Goa'uld are the primary antagonists.",1
"If anything, the ramped - up quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere. In the case of RIGHT TO DIE, he takes the latter approach, and it definitely works. Fans of the HBO series "" Tales From the Crypt "" are going to love this MOH episode.",1
"< br / > < br / > Really good effort. I don't know how he wrangled it, but we've got some real talent in this episode!",1
"Do NOT watch whilst eating pudding. Some parts are very reminiscant of "" Hellraiser "", but come off as tribute rather than imitation. I liked this one a lot. This piece brings it and doesn't appologize.",1
"What more could you ask for, you might ask? His airbag worked, her's didn't. Excellent episode, this is one I'm buying for sure.",1
"But the fun is in the journey. < br / > < br / > Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliché romantic comedy.",1
"I know... sounds kooky... but it is. He was in Rounders, too. The rest of the cast is fun.",1
"Also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it. It's a postcard of NY. It's a simple hook, but it works.",1
Thanks! Great love story for the soul! This was a great movie. He was talking to Charlie and Annna in the church as they were leaving? < br / > < br / > Don't EVER GET COMPLACENT AND TAKE TRUE LOVE FOR GRANTED! IT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST LESSON OF MY LIFE.,1

Most on this channel, whether "" set "" there, in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, L. A. And, while the two leads have done enough to be known to most, they were completely unknown to me.",1
"Not anything heavy, but it made me smile.",1
"SG1 also excels in humour, from O'Neill's wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd! Christopher Judge is excellent as the aloof Teal'c, who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety. < br / > < br / > The top - notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life.",1
"To be entertained. The two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure the women love him. It is no more unrealistic than any of dramas that are screened every hour on the tube. I think you'll like it.",1
My teenagers liked it too. It never did.,1
"Finally found it yesterday 2 / 13 / 02 on Lifetime Movie Channel. < br / > < br / > God Bless her, her family and future endeavors.",1
Fresher. Well acted. Very funny film.,1
"However, i enjoyed this movie. If you are expecting to see a great romance, this is not it.",1
"I just can't understand the negative comments about this film. and Vartan holds his own. is as magnetic and alluring as ever ( who says the golden age of cinema is dead? ) If you are already happy, then you will be euphoric.",1
Thanks Fox for producing it. Why not! This great movie has failed to register a higher rating than 5!,1
"If you like Johnny Cash, this film is quite enjoyable.",1

Besides I am a Johnny Cash fan and it was brave venture. The Gospel road was one of them.,1
Season # 9 should be a thrill in itself.,1
She had amazing comedic timing.,1
"Lake Bell is excellent, too, and this is the first time I have seen her. It's too bad. Ah, what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie. I took a flyer in renting this movie but I gotta say, it was very, very good. Some of us save our praise for the truly worthy, however. Never before has a movie made L. A. look so good.",1
"Ah, I loved this movie. 2 in rating. It was awesome.",1

This is a great film.,1
I think that not exactly but who cares? 5.,1
Sadly the actual film wasn't as good.,1
"< br / > < br / > overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much. but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a decent happy ending. a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess. the movie was quite short though ( around 85 min. )",1
They work together very well. The characters are all funny.,1

"This picture has everything any movie could ever have. It's all in there, adding up to a myth. < br / > < br / > The movie is not without its share of realism. Yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance. The rest of the story takes place in India, where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence. Nana Patekar dominates every scene he's in with a scary but nuanced character.",1
"The power of a warlord, and the power of a mother. Then things go terribly wrong.",1
"< br / > < br / > All in all, a nice watch. But you cant get a Sholay every week. In fact, she has performed much better that when I last saw her.",1
"When she wants to leave, Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India. < br / > < br / > The film's biggest strength is the performances. Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home, but he is soon killed by his father's enemies. Portrayed realistically throughout, film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch.",1
"Nana Patekar was excellent as her father - in - law. Sanjay Kapoor was all right, but he didn't have much to do. Without them, this movie would not have an impact. Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role. The movie was disturbing at moments. The Ishq Kamina song was very out of place. And boy Aish is mad hot.",1
Having an intelligent interesting script doesn t hurt either.,1
"Karisma Kapoor is excellent as an Indian woman in Canada who marries a friend ( Sanjay Kapoor ), has a child, and then visits his family in India only to find they are terrorist warlords. His throw - away comic - book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film's primary gripping drama. The directorial style of writer / director Krishna Wamsi is sloppy, rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts, although his camera movement is good. Uneven Bollywood drama.",1
"What is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band. Try the concert out, it really is amazing.",1
< br / > < br / > The Original Drum and Bass. This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle. The point being that whoever were there it was The Who that the majority had come to see. This show was one year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 1960's ; Woodstock.,1
Oh well.,1
"It's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material, and almost always under appreciated. I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to love it as much as I do.",1
< br / > < br / > Go watch this!,1
"His great vision and creativity really helped this film. Also performing well was young actress Rebecca Lusterio. I certainly won't be raving about the story of this film. I think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her. She did a great job portraying Bikay, the younger sister of Duroy.",1
Downside : the corny and stilted acting of the American antagonist.,1
"As a kid, I loved this game. This is especially infuriating with the Level 5 boss. Beating up all the bad guys and the end - of - level boss is much fun. This leads to the'bad ending'in which you become the the boss of the syndicate. Then Streets of Rage 2 came out.",1
"And sometimes not even then. Originally, the series starred Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O'Neill ( two "" l "" s! He finally left "" SG - 1 "" in March 2005 in order to spend more time with his then six - year - old daughter. < br / > < br / > As with all long - running series, they were numerous cast changes.",1
Would you expect perfection in hell? I hope for a sequel very soon. No pun intended.,1
< br / > < br / > Then she seeks revenge... and the rest you better see it from the movie.,1
Like Titan A. E. meet's the live action version of Punisher. I thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie.,1
If the movies got anymore awesome. And I am female. I would have her babies. It was awesome.,1
< br / > < br / > Character development was fine. Why everyone else hates that is beyond me.,1
Absolutely FANTASTIC!,1
Cinema imitates life & visa versa. Come on! It's good for Americans to stretch a little.,1
All these incidents cause other events that... well you get the picture? Fate? < Stranger things have happened. < br / > < br / > So what's a happenstance? But then this is the magic world of cinema. Perhaps it's an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings.,1
Because it runs on an amazing premise. And why? < br / > < br / > - From the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the Goaul'd and preventing attacks on Earth.,1
"< br / > < br / > The DVD jacket shows just Audrey Tautou. The pace is brisk, the acting fine and the conclusion isn't bad at all.",1
"Stanley Kramer did it with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions. This earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways : more characters and more complexity. This occurs in the first few minutes of the film.",1
I want the CD! I loved it - it's a great love story.,1
"The talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as butterfly wings. < br / > < br / > Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene.",1
"). The real translation,'The Beating of the Butterfly's Wings ', is oddly not used as the translated title. It is at the same time a very brave ending.",1
"The ending to this movie is top notch. In fact, as Irene, her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first. Yes, it's true, there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn't seen at all for maybe 45 min, but I didn't even miss her because I was having so much fun with the other characters.",1
Each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film.,1
"The acting is so bad it's hard to believe. Sexual tension between the sisters. A little subtle masochism. We had Blackboard Jungle, On the Waterfront and so on. He was right. It was shot in and around LA mostly at night and probably without permits. Hereditary insanity - if there is such a thing. I don't. The results are predictable. One or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar.",1
"Whew! All three siblings ( only one of whom is really bad ) are great beauties but it's Kathleen Hughes'cartoon villainy that stands out. Teenage sister Vicki is quite a piece of work as well, reminiscent of Carmen Sternwood in THE BIG SLEEP.",1
"I truly don't know where it was shown. < br / > < br / > The movie is not bad. - - bare - chested. The women are scantily dressed. Boy, are they bad, too! He had something of a career.",1
The other prominent role here is that of Irish actor Milo O'Shea playing a nice Jewish doctor. Kaminsky is mostly bedridden. He's reduced to applying for welfare. It's one interesting twist on the themes from It's A Wonderful Life.,1
"Mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife Fanny. He learns too late how empty his hustling, materialistic life was without love.",1
A disgrace. 3??? The movie is not perfect. < br / > < br / > 5. Its true rating should be an 8 or a 9.,1

"< br / > < br / > "" Yeti "" never stoops as low as say, "" A. P. E. "" does.",1
YETI deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made. ). If you are a fan of classic cinema crap - seek this baby out.,1
Stargate is the best show ever. I love the connection between the characters.,1
"< br / > < br / > Vote 7 and half out of 10. Also the music is pretty cool, its very YETI like.",1
"< br / > < br / > It's here that the film won me over : It's enthusiasm just for being made. Here's another movie that should be loaded into a satellite, fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy Andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity.",1
"If you can find it, don't pass it up.",1
). And I'm sure as hell going to check out more from director!,1
"! Too bad, they don't make films like this more often. This great film has both!",1
< br / > < br / > The production is very impressive and the setting is bleak. An unusual film from Ringo Lam and one that's strangely under - appreciated. Several horses get chopped up. Blood is everywhere. It's very unexpected.,1
Sadly this has not been true of films he has made in Hollywood.,1
"But this is just as humans are, not even Buddhist priests can be saints all the time. accepted from then on as a given ; namely, the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy. "" Burning Paradise "" put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance. ( If you want to know how, see the film! )",1
"Overall, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved dearly for years.",1
"It's sweet, funny and warms your heart. I disagree with Anyone who done't like this movie.",1
I will sadly miss it. From episode one I was hooked. Robert wrote something that felt close to reality. I thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else's criticisms. I never want show to die. But over the years they've turned into a family ). < br / > < br / > Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?,1
"Overall, I like this film lot! Genre : Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, circus.?",1
"I don't get the rating, honestly I don't. But the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation. The voice acting for me was what made the movie. 7. It doesn't wow me as much at 17, but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie. All in all, this is a good movie. had me in stitches. My favourite is Screweyes though, effective villain who is crafty and I suppose intelligent.",1
"I think I'll give it a pass on those factors too, and just enjoy the story. Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr. Screweyes. < br / > < br / > Considering the target audience, who I'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues... < br / > < br / > Now, what detracts from the film is it's unexpected scariness. I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie, so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.",1
"Worth seeing. I wouldn't call "" We're Back! True, it's escapism, but the perceptive kind. A Dinosaur's Story "" simply a kiddie version of "" Jurassic Park "".",1
all who go against this movie are killing their inner child! i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever!,1
"But since they probably suck at making films, they probably wouldn't be able to pull it off. Have you seen the hills have eyes 2? This movie has to be my favorite of all time. There still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing.",1
"The Japanese people (? ) Like I said pure underground. It don't sound that bad at all, but it CAN make you go nuts ). Check it out if you are a fan of underground horror, or foreign gore.",1
"The worst is the eye scene. But then, some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out.",1
The film fails to shock. Wrong. So I popped this sucker in and sat down. < br / > < br / > Sounds like one sick flick right? I bought the Guinea Pig Box Set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date.,1
"I haven't always been a fan, but the show grew on me. only allowing his close friends in. The Jaffa would die. Colonel Jack O'Neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage.",1
"This movie gets right to the point, you may be thinking what point? There are really only 3 scene's that could be considered gore.",1
I have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best.,1
And then :'Where the hell have they found that girl? '.,1
! I give it a 10 / 10. It scared me. SPOILERS!!!,1
Take your chance to watch it! After that I watch all sequels.,1
The men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die.,1
"But, gorehounds probably won't find anything special.",1
Wonderful. This review is for the Devils Experiment. Pure unadulterated violence. Now before you ask why am I writing a review? Why do I watch horror films? We all want blood and gore. Why do people bash it.,1
A lot of people unfairly sh! These two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings. It's plot as it stands is simple : A young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is. Her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling. Some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest. 8. t on this series but several of the Guinea Pig videos are fairly entertaining.,1
"The characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature. They are simply fun to watch. Their tone is serious, but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor. They exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons. What happens next was always unpredictable. < br / > < br / > The episodes are light ( innocent and easy to watch ) and very creative.",1
"Anyway, this one is a must - see for horror fans!",1
"The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film. I first saw it on video a few years back after reading Roger Ebert's review, which proclaimed it the best film of 1987. The climax of the movie is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. Boy, was I in for a surprise. This was one of the smartest, most well - written movies I had ever seen. "" It is truly a must - see. I had my doubts, mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year.",1
Definitely worth shot.,1
You're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie. < br / > < br / > This is both a quality and a drawback of the script. Watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way.,1
"all the while building story. """,1
I love this movie!,1
The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. He never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest. Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying show. I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Yet'O'Neill's'tactical instincts always seem sound. Richard Dean Anderson 2. The villains ( Wraiths ) are so improbable as to be ludicrous. Amanda Tapping.,1
"Highly, hugely recommended!",1
This is why people are giving it such high ratings. Ask yourself where she got the gun?,1
"All in all, House of Games is a truly first rate thrill ride. She may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act. At times it's almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film.",1
But who is conning who here? SPOILERS This is a gripping movie about grifters. When does the hunter turn into the prey?,1
Get ready for it : This is one of my favourite films of all time. The feel of the film is very similar to The Sting ( 1973 ) and it also pays homage to film noir.,1
It is wonderful. Could anything be more true?,1
"< br / > < br / > It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it. House Of Games "" does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do. Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks!",1
To reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and'House of Games'may very well be the best con movie I've seen. Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna.,1
I loved them all. It just means they're a letdown if you've gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons. It is a great loss. Not a big deal. It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series.,1
From the opening scene this movie just gets you. House of Games is spell binding. The character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful.,1
"It all sounds very read, rather than spoken. He's far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. The camera is very cinematic. Everything flowed. Here's my first David Mamet directed film.",1
To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense. I'll say no more ).,1
It should be a natural for film festivals. What tripe. It is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller. House of Games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels. House of Games sticks to its business. At this level it does succeed admirably.,1
"He offers Crouse's character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he'll cancel the patients debts. Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order. < br / > < br / > The gambler Mike ( played excellently by Joe Mantegna ) turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty. House of Games can also be viewed as a ` class - war'division movie. This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension.",1
"By this time, not only Margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked. Instead of the ` twenty - five large'that Billy claimed he owed, Mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars. And nothing is what it seems.",1
"Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life. This movie is amazing! In the process of gaining everything, he loses the one person who truly loved him.",1
It is typical Jim Carrey humor and it is really funny.,1
It also had a message.,1
"What better comic genius to remind us of that than Jim Carry. It's great to see Jim recognizing and embracing his strengths. box office disappointments. ! And, again, about 0.",1
< br / > < br / > I like director Tom Shadyac's choices of movies. Jennifer Aniston had some good moments.,1
` Bruce Almighty'will sweep the Academy Awards with a record 14 Oscar wins! * * * * Good Carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in ` Bruce Almighty '. Almighty then! It will surpass ` Titanic'as the highest grossing film of all time! pittiful'as Bruce's girlfriend.,1
Eight out of ten stars. Elements of Jim's real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie.,1
I feel like I got my money'worth.,1
Thats all from BigV over and out! This movie is very entertaining though. Well not actually. In fact all the characters are great.,1
His character is like all of us. < br / > < br / > A funny film.,1
"he is truely a multi - function actor. I am a VERY big Jim Carrey fan. I laughed my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. < br / > < br / > Overall, I would have to rate this a 9.",1
< br / > < br / > Poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci - fi series.,1
"After all these years, I could finally see the film!",1
A very funny movie.,1
"Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey's best pictures since... well... a long time.",1
"He was both funny and sad. I rate this film 9 / 10. The script worked well, too.",1
"I thought this quite well, especially with brilliant Freeman. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways.",1
"< br / > < br / > * * * out of * * * * Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more. Bruce Almighty "" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps.",1
Jim Carrey needs meds!,1
"Hallelujah! < br / > < br / > Theology - wise, puh - leeze!!!",1
"It's just God. But as a plot, it works well. But without Carrey, it would kinda feel like a It's a Wonderful Life wannabe. And it's really funny. At least, you don't think that when you see her. < br / > < br / > OK, that was kinda long.",1
I was totally engrossed and LMAO all the way through.,1
Now either you like Mr Carrey's humour or you don't.,1
"In this way, I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power. And, if you don't like SG - 1 after giving it a fair chance, then sci - fi is probably NOT genre for you.",1
"Nothing is sacred anymore. Confused? < Jim Carrey playing God? Enter flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor.",1
"Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film. The results were not very promising, so it's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.",1
"I only enjoyed the fighting scenes, everything else is rubbish. < br / > < br / > Recommended. He's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help. This Golden Harvet production was helmed by veteran director Robert Clouse.",1
Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned.,1
I only wish they could've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as The Obsolete Man was. his parents ask Dickie whether he'd prefer to watch TV all night. I found it to be better than the short story it was based on.,1
"A corker of a concluding scene! The boy then asks, puzzled again, why wouldn't he?",1
And the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation. Why? To see their heroes in action one more time. That's the way I feel about Doc Savage.,1
"A temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is Baseball. There were mediums that were ancestral to them. Obviously, the Newspaper Comic Strip was one parent, providing the visual / narrative method of story telling. But the Comic Book just did not magically appear, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself.",1
"Upon this point I cannot comment, having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously. and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles. < br / > < br / > Best scene? Priceless!",1
"< br / > < br / > That was only the beginning of the adventure. Then Daniel's wife gets captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen. It explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention. Where did the Goa'uld ( Ra's race ) come from? Such as, how was the Stargate activated without a human computer?",1
). Ron Ely is just right as Doc. Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day. I give it 7 out of 10.,1
Most people miss Hollywood's point of concept.,1
"I think the problem is the movie's schizophrenic. Except for Monk, as has been mentioned before : he's hugely muscled, not obese. When the writers and producers get it right, they do get it right - I'll give them that. But they are very close to the feel of the pulps.",1
"A couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between Doc and Seas near the end of the film. This is NOT one of those martial arts films. The fight sequences are lively, brisk and, above all, not gratuitous. Another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the "" bad guy "" ( Seas ) is dealt with. Ron Ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play Doc. This is a VERY entertaining movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > Paul Wexler's ham - and - cheese blackhat, Captain Seas is a an absolute delight. A prime candidate for DVD release, it is certainly overdue.",1
"I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always gets the girls "" has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men. Ron Ely is a God.",1
B. ) Not to mention kung - fu. I am talking of course about the classic Doc Savage ( M. o.,1
< br / > < br / > “ The Verger ” tells of a church sexton ( James Hayter ) – for which story ’ s title is another word – who ’ s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest ( Michael Hordern ) simply because he ’ s illiterate.,1
"I love that posh bird who plays his wife, too.",1
< br / > < br / > Observation. Trio's vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable.,1
"A message movie, but a rather good one. etc. ) Outstanding cast, top to bottom.",1
"Another 15 minute one, and also very good. So what does he do?",1
Soon he has a whole chain of stores. Again the author introduces the film and the stories. I won't describe the way Max rises to the occasion. When he hears Hayter has no schooling he fires him.,1
Wilhelm Grimm ( Alexander Knox ) stands trial for Nazi crimes.,1
"A horrible person, yes, but never a paper hanger! In this fictitious world court, a Nazi leader is being tried for war crimes.",1
There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazi destroyed people's families and their entire lives. The cattle cars are shown in this picture with Jewish people heading to the Nazi gas chambers.,1
"He betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse. I still can't get over it. This little B picture is a taut story, well told. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. Maybe not Oscar worthy, but the best of her career.",1
"Knox as the Nazi is brilliant. This one is tough to watch - - as an earlier reviewer says. That is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after WWII - - particularly the "" liberation "" of Dachau.",1
Miss Dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience. ( episode from Seinfeld ) The parents have there jaw dropping moment fun over fun It is screaming bring me back.,1
"Not too deep. Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. < br / > < br / > But... the movie really shines in a couple of areas. Enjoy the movie! Still, it's vintage Madame, and shouldn't be missed. The phone conversation across the border is really memorable. Check out lines about curtains, etc.",1
"I'll kill him. "" He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles. < br / > < br / > His first impulse is "" I'll kill him.",1
"One beauty of this film is that it is not pro - American. I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler. < br / > < br / > Geoff Say what you will about schmaltz. As Fanny says, "" We've been shaken out of the magnolias. """,1
"Redd Foxx is great. ). The movie had me laughing from start to finish. His son, Norman, is now grown up and living on his own.",1
Just as it should be. It is very funny and YES very rude and hilariously all wrong. In fact as a groovy 1976 film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today.,1
I wish there were more films like this.,1
"Some fun gags - Williams even takes the man they arrested along on a date with his girlfriend. Director Alexander Hall made mostly comedies, was reportedly engaged to Lucy at some point. Don't want to give away any spoilers, so you'll have to catch it on Turner Classic Movies.",1
"< br / > < br / > Entertaining if a little on the long side. < br / > < br / > One of the comments here trashed Melvyn Douglas, one of our greatest actors. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are on hand for excellent support.",1
I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable.,1
"( Maltin's movie book does not contain it. ) There are a lot of laughs in the process. In nearly every department, Amazing Mr. Williams is a jewel. < br / > < br / > The film goes on a bit too long, but who cares? Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are hilarious.",1
"And the effervescent Joan Blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb : "" Good grief! '< br / > < br / > The crime - solving here is standard fare, although a fine cast of character actors helps bring material to life. < br / > < br / > "" The Amazing Mr. Williams "" contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in film history, and its bright comic repartee sparkles. You look like my Aunt Nellie! Ludicrously frocked, Melvyn Douglas delivers some of the best lines : "" I'd walk down Main Street in a Turkish towel before I'd let any woman control my life! """,1
And this one is GREAT!,1
"It sounded more like anti - Fascism speeches than the voices of real children. The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman. And, the basic story idea and plot is good,... but the dialog is just bad at times. While this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today.",1
They family went through hell. I cant believe this case went on for so long. But still having to deal with the rumours. I think everyone should watch this.,1
"A heart - breaking story, very well done, bit long but well worth seeing. 8 out of 10.",1
< br / > < br / > See it! Those with supporting roles are also quite good.,1
"Judge not lest ye be judged "" is one of them. This review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based. Although Chamberlain was eventually released, this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence "" proving "" their innocence, something no defendants should have to produce. So although cleared by an initial inquest, they were later prosecuted and convicted. The story suggesting her innocence was unlikely ( a dingo was alleged to have taken it ), but those implying her guilt even more so, and there was no solid evidence against her.",1
"It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions. But at the same, the media / public opinion is understandable. The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured. < br / > < br / > The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all more gripping. < br / > < br / has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable. If you ask me, this is an under - appreciatted classic.",1
"She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is highly suspicious. I've always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 Angry Men before they go through with their duties. A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical. Some may find film boring or dry, but I found it engaging.",1
"No - one believed them. < br / > < br / > The outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts. Even her accent is almost, but not quite, spot on. What followed was a gross miscarriage of justice. How could we as a nation even sit in judgement?",1
"I found it hard to like anyone in this film. The reason I appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out, from the victims to the masses. Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are.",1
The story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself. The cast just makes it that much more appealing.,1
"A pretty good film. A bit different. Well, at least as an actress.",1
They are going by train to Davis's relatives house. Their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself.,1
< br / > < br / > ( Spoiler warning! ) And they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based - on - fact individuals. It captured the themes of the story brilliantly. Not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis. It's an issue that has to be constantly addressed.,1
7 / 10 Where this really stands out is the acting. The performances are excellent.,1
"< br / > < br / > Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael was falling apart. Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news - media.",1
"Beautiful photography, haunting music. I think it's not only a very good, but a very important, movie. Spoilers Following : I picked up the book "" Evil Angels "" when it first came out knowing nothing of the case. all quite convincingly. The author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did. Just to give the press and the Austrialian people a break here, I was quite far into it before I began to question the Chamberlain's guilt. It was also highly technical evidence, difficult for a layman to understand. I've always liked Sam, who I could identify with completely, and Meryl was perfect as always. Too bad it didn't receive more publicity at the time it was released.",1
"Not being wealthy, the family camps near the site. The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo. If you have never seen or heard of this film, remedy that straight away. How could this happen? Suddenly, she hears Azaria crying.",1

"An unqualified "" 10. """,1
"Definitely one of Fred Schepisi'best movies ever. Even though this was a pure accident, it still happened. But when I saw it, I was shocked at what it portrayed.",1
"5, and a perfect 10 for Streep. She was played realistically, too.",1
"A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case, tears are brought to eyes. Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy, as she always does.",1
Bet Davis.,1
The Aussie accents get a bit thick at times but notcomprehensible. Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them. I do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case ( the accused are Seven - Day Adventists ).,1
( She learned it so well I had trouble understanding her in parts. ),1

"I just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45 mins of ROLL. Well, that was the plan anyway. Needless to say, Mat gets dragged into George's world.",1
"And then things go wrong. Roll is fast - paced, often funny, and a very worthwhile use of an hour.",1
Good Fun. I've just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be.,1
Watch out for these two.,1
": ) The penalty however, I was disappointed in. I loved the character of Matt, and also Tiny. Overall, I liked the film and it'll get about an 8 rating.",1
"Equally significantly, it reminds us that World War II had a purpose. Maybe. We've watched jackboots stomp the living hills in "" The Sound of Music "" ( 1965 ).",1
i'll keep checking in. in 1976 i had just moved to the us from ceylon.,1
The previous reviewer has said it exactly. I would love to see this movie again ; I would buy this one if it ever came out on DVD.,1
I even wrote to the PBS station for more information. johntopping. You can find it at : http : / / www.,1
Sure it should be on DVD but surely at least a video?,1
"This wonderful film is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper. It's September of 2004, and I keep hoping - - deep sigh. org.",1
This was a very funny movie based on the classic series! !,1
"Of course the film isn't a masterpiece, i don't think it was aiming to be. and jessica Simpson is plain hot, i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences. People, enjoy it for what it is.",1
The real star is of course the General Lee. REALITY CHECK : The original series wasn't that good. The car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what D. O. H. is all about. < br / > < br / > Back to the movie. Having read some of the other comments here I was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised.,1
I enjoyed myself here a lot more than I did with other summer blockbusters. I'm a huge fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. It's just a great dumb movie! It was the perfect Dukes plot.,1
Give this movie AAA! It blew me away.,1
The possible exception is Now Voyager. Loved the movie. < br / > < br / > I guess I just don't'get'Bette Davis.,1
I absolutely adore this film.,1
Some of the back story on this production is fascinating.,1
I loved every minute of it.,1
"A magical journey concocted by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. Again, A MUST SEE!",1
"There's hardly a down moment here. I also really loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra, the father of the princess. A fantastic Arabian adventure. And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful. Jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse. 8 / 10.",1
"Ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature, and adds an element of danger to the proceedings. And look out for the moment where he's tricked back into his bottle! Sabu, the astonishingly muscled 15year - old, is near - namesake Abu, a likeably cocky thief. Also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet.",1
"< br / > < br / > Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source. Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940. But DeMille nor any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film. This was Veidt's career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser. He certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the UK. Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this film.",1
"It doesn't kill the film, but it does weaken it. Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end. I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin cribbed from the film.",1
"We watched it last Friday, and he liked it. Because the narrative demands it. "" Is he gonna beat the spider, Poppa? "" Just watch, you'll see.",1
"Naziism had to be stopped, and anything that helped do it was good. I have seen this film several times, and watched it today ( on TCM ) solely because of Geraldine Fitzgerald. < br / > < br / > All the other actors did ). But Muller IS a German and he is engaged in his own "" Wach am Rhein "".",1
"Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief. "" Georges Perinal's photography is some of the best use of Technicolor. Every frame has its own magical charm. < br / > < br / > As with all great works of art, beauty of "" The Thief of Bagdad "" lies in the detail. < br / > < br / > Rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film. Here is a film that will never grow old.",1
It ` as timeless as the story it treats. An amazing work.,1
< br / > < br / > This remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time. They arrive Basora where Ahamad and the princess ( gorgeous June Duprez ) fall in love.,1
It remains a favourite of many people.,1
"This is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children, it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well. Great film and although an'oldie ', definitely a goldie '. One only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides. In my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. I hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on DVD someday. Who then watches effects?",1
Here is a villain worth watching. < br / > < br / > Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the Storyteller. < br / > < br / > The rest of the cast do fine work. Aged Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of Legend.,1
"Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden. The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by Abu as his dog. He does awaken her. Then he is captured.",1
Jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns Abu into a dog. From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter. The production designs are just stunning in this movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > Encounting treachery around them, Lukas successfully deals with situation. He knows he must return to Europe on a clandestine mission and return he does. < br / > < br / > A wonderful film highlighting American positive propaganda against a wicked foe.",1
He set the bar very high. The Thief of Baghdad is one of my ten all - time favorite movies. The casting couldn't have been better.,1
"Conrad Veidt played baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever, this and Casablanca, and then died. and Love not only conquers but annihilates everything. Anyway, if I'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies, flying horses and carpets I also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects!",1
The effects fit with the script. The Thief of Bagdad is a treasure. I recommend it. Yet they fit into the story well.,1
Whoa there! Sabu is the Thief. Conrad Veidt is grand villain.,1
"The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films. The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it - - nice, but not as it should be. THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. ! Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. NOW comes the M - G - M DVD ( 3 Dec 2002 ) issue. The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful!",1
"There's magic in the number three, and there is magic in this movie.",1
The sets are beautiful.,1
"Those effects still work their charm. For a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind. The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram. Still, I don't think anyone under eight ought to see "" Thief of Bagdad. "" ( Howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film. Their adventures through the gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.",1
Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work. < br / > < br / > Davis is daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days. Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was. They're made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.,1
The MGM art and music departments also did a good job.,1
"These web sites can be located by using any good search engine. Enjoy, I know that I sure did. This is a most handsome film.",1
Also it's highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia ; the role lay too high for him. What is true is that Dorothy's father diso He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake. What killed him?,1
Lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso.,1
"It's why both became the legends that they are. For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on the earth. No one else could have done it, I doubt whether it will ever be tried again. He's shown in a recording studio once late in his life.",1
The result was a wonderful movie. Obviously today's $ 10 movies will dominate. 00 or less.,1
I like it because of my recent personal experience. The end was not quite important after all. I am on journey too. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable.,1
Smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans.,1
"The lead characters are not perfect, and so relating to them as people you could know is easy. < br / > < br / > I am now restless waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel. Will soften even hardiest heart.",1
Easily the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. You can't look away nor can you stop listening to them. Stunning. Even the little moments just melt your heart.,1
"The monologue he has about the need to kill is gut - wrenching, just to mention one scene. < br / > < br / > The last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of emotions. Highly recommended.",1
"I saw the elements more clearly : Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything. The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other. I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago. etc.. When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it. But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel that's more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before.",1
i'm not even sure what to say about this film.,1
"I must admit that at the beginning, I was sort of reticent about watching this movie. Still, I watched it!",1
"Love needs mutual understanding. The funniest scene was their listening to CD in music store. Then the romantic story unfolded. They peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact. On the train he met a French girl Celine.",1
A must see movie for all the people who believe in true love.,1
and Before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful! !,1
"They meet on the Budapest - Vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together. After sleeping it over, I have to say that I largely prefer the former over the latter, and I shall explain why.",1
"Still it did not ruin the movie. < br / > < br / > BOTTOM LINE : The movie's flow is slow. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but I may be underestimating their intelligence. < br / > < br / > The overall story is very simple which I think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power. It's truly fantastic. The story builds gently, systematically and substantive. This is a slow moving story. No crazy suspense. They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an intruder. The dialog is fascinating. I really mean that. No action.",1
"Ethan Hawke as "" Jessie "" comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a Maynard G. Krebs of the nineties. After a chance encounter on the train, a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of Vienna, discussing life and love. The primary reason to see "" Before Sunrise, "" is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines. < br / > < br / > If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. Further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing. Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots.",1
"? They have a great chemistry in their roles. I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else. But it certainly spoke to me. It's very intimate. This disgusts me. ! I, on the other hand, felt completely the opposite. It's a very personal film that doesn't speak to all people. They also like to be spoon - fed tidy endings - - happy OR sad.",1
I loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone!!,1
"< br / > < br / > This is simply gem of a movie that you can't miss. She still looks stunning in this film, 12 years after. The story also relies heavily on dialogue. This movie is intelligent. Every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly.",1
"Here it's often about relationships and commitments, as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the'town ', in Vienna, until his plane the next morning. No one does, at least that's deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film.",1
"This is truly truly one of the best movies about love that I've ever seen. And this is what makes "" Before Sunrise "" so good. Wonderful acting, excellent script, and beautiful locations. It's so real, so engaging and funny. < br / > < br / > Once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books. It's PERFECT. Young love, at it's best. < br / > < br / > This is "" love "" in the real world.",1
"They talk and fall in love. It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. That's it, that's the movie.",1
< br / > < br / > See it and it may change your way of life. This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing.,1
"maybe that speaks about myself, my friends, or just the sheer genius of this movie. it also made me want to ride the train around Europe! i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie. i watched this movie 10 years ago.",1
"I didn't know what to expect from it, but nor did the young couple. < br / > < br / > The movie'Before Sunrise'just caught me watching it. We are too afraid to check that out.",1
"SEE IT! To my surprise, it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s.",1
"Few can claim that. They both look at America's spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s. "" I think that Bogie should have got it for role of Dobbs, but it did not happen. It does not strike me as totally wrong.",1
"Ethan Hawke ( Jesse ) "" Tape ""'01 and Julie Delpy ( Celine ) "" ER "" 94 TV Series ( Nicole ).",1
Dialog and acting are great. But that's not the point. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts.,1
Their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached. I want to go to Vienna. They are both masterpieces. I want to see them as soon as possible again.,1
"My vote is ten. < br / > < br / > "" Before Sunrise "" is one of my favorite romances, indeed one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. Yesterday I have probably watched this movie for third or fourth time, and I still love it.",1
Richard Linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation.,1
What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. This movie is mostly all dialogue - based. It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that film suggests.,1
"Finally, you have love of child and parent. ! There is the love in a marriage. I pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it. One cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie. There is the divine love of God that is beautifully portrayed.",1
"< br / > < br / > Definitely worth seeing... buy DVD. However, I did not like the lighting in this movie... for a movie dealing with such subject matter, it was too bright.",1
This movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today.,1
But the story - line grip the heart with a powerful lesson.,1
"< br / > < br / > We are introduced to the Muller family, when the film opens. < br / > < br / > The film offers excellent acting all around. Her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country. Watch on the Rhine "" must have come as a result of those years. They are crossing the border to the United States from Mexico.",1
This was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption. What about all people of all cultural backgrounds?,1
A Vow to Cherish is a wonderful movie.,1
"In fact, Ellen no longer recognizes him... < br / > < br / > Second, the movie is exceptionally humane. What for is there faith?",1
"Exactly : We've seen this before. 7 / 10 This fact is the main problem I have with the film, cause it's not really about the robbers at all. It's about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies. < br / > < br / > All in all it's an entertaining film that steals more money in it's plot than time from you. A nice touch!",1
The ending is very predictable but satisfying.,1
"Dana's role is accessible, natural, and entertaining. Her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers, but they are a loving family. The title cards are also incredibly clever.",1
"Sadly, it does.",1
Monstervision was a show I grew up with.,1
"Until then "" thats Great Television ""! It was like the 90's version of Chiller Theater.",1
"If I had a dozen thumbs, they'd all be "" up "" this movie.",1
"Snotty of me, isn't it? < br / > < br / > Desmond Howl had it all. I'm sure anyone who watches enough Canadian movies, especially late at night on the CBC, knows exactly what I'm talking about. I'll tell you a tale of the summer of 1994. This is the reason I have hated the Rheostatics to this day. < br / > < br / > Canadian cinema suffers from several problems.",1
I enjoyed this film yet hated it because I wanted to help this guy! A MUST SEE! BUT it portrays the life of an old rock star - abandoned and lost - in a believable way.,1
It's horrible what they did to film. I don't know why.,1
Loved it and hope it will someday come out on DV,1
Yet he has musical genius. She also finds a mutual friend that accepts her. She learns to trust him over a period of time.,1
But instead that they both represent modern love stories.,1
"< br / > < br / > I found the film in 1996, on video. An amazing read!",1
Don't miss it!,1
"The bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt. Still, the melodramatic touch is present. It will be so much more fun! When he all of the sudden dies, she is confronted with the truth. The story is quite original, the performances outstanding!",1
10-Oct,1
Watch this movie if you ever get a chance. Even the characters name ( Bodo ) is funny. < br / > < br / > 9 / 10 He just cracks me up.,1
"He's been doing it all wrong, so Grace helps him out. 8 / 10.",1
I love this film. Either would have killed the film completely.,1
"Well worth seeing. to get more money for breakage and the manager said at same time "" oh no "" also referring to the money. But then it doesn't try to be anything it is not. The band's performance was on the spot, each one playing their role in a deft, comical manner.",1
"< br / > < br / > The acting is top - notch. Not so here. It's all about the charm. Anyone who ventures into this movie will leave with their spirits soaring high ( haha ). She's a nice lady, but she's not stupid.",1
"Just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their "" tea ""!! I saw it last night on TV, and was quite delighted.",1
The premise alone is appealing. The supporting cast also does a fine job.,1
Saving Grace is a feel good movie with it's heart in the right place.,1
"But anyway, you gotta see this movie.",1
She's a true lady.,1
"For Muslim women in western Africa, married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard. Overall, this is a terrific little film, and much more fun to watch than you might imagine.",1
"But it's an enjoyable spliff, to be sure.",1
The last five minutes cost it 2 points in my rating.,1
The characters are what makes the movie so good. Since then it's become one of my favorites! I saw Saving Grace right after it came out on video.,1
"You will definitely laugh, which is the best medicine!",1
I couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore. You will love.,1
"I mean, the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness!",1
I just thought it was excellent and I still do. < br > < br / > 7 / 10.,1
The sounds are magnificant. That's about it. Everything from speaking to the SFX are pleasant and realistic.,1
Sisters in law will be released theatrically on march 24th in Sweden.,1
This was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future.,1
The controls are great. The gameplay is addictive.,1
one of the funnest mario's i've ever played. good for playing in short bursts of time. there's also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight.,1
"< br / > < br / > Now, the music. I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game towards the end. Bright colors, great effects and awesome sound effects. Each had about five or six challnges to get the stars. I found the graphics in the water courses very very good. The characters are really great. But of course, you have beat Bowser. And I LOVED IT! Especially for it's time.",1
Or at least one of the best.,1
"Yes, that's right, it is. A must have for any N64 owner, and a reason to get an N64 for everyone else.",1
< br / > < br / > 10 / 10 Now you can do it a 3D environment.,1
Nintendo is best! This game is amazing.,1
"Mario must save the day again. You enter the world by going through a painting. It's great. If you have an N64, buy this game. Unlike the 2 - D games, Mario can explore anything he wants to. No time limits.",1
There is brief language in this. I recommend this to any fan of romance stories.,1
"The more people who see this film, better.",1
"This is an OK adaptation, but not as good as the TV version. It is far too lush. < br / > < br / > My biggest criticism is scenery. England has never been like this.",1
"I thought you overqualified. "" Lucky us! I wish she had read a little more. I liked Emma and also recommend it. I like Gwyneth, and think that she is a lovely young woman.",1
Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel.,1
"Emma is Jane Austen's most accessible and least stuffy story, told well.",1
"Then there are all those Austen sequels churned out by modern writers ). < br / > < br / > The main character is Emma Woodhouse, a young lady from an aristocratic family in Regency England. No doubt, however, there will be more to come in the near future. This scheme goes disastrously wrong, however, as Elton has no interest in Harriet, but has fallen in love with Emma herself. Instead, her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends. Emma is, financially, considerably better off than most Austen heroines such as Elizabeth Bennett or Fanny Price, and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband.",1
Very good results.,1
< br / > < br / > The film is full of Jane Austen's witty and wry characterizations. He is certainly well - matched to Gwyneth Paltrow. Mr. Knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films.,1
I've seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one!,1
"Was the granting of a divorce by a Muslim court, against express wishes of the husband, a one time event? They made the movie two years ago, not yesterday. It will leave you, as it left me, with many questions about exactly how this change occurred. This is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the Cameroon.",1
"And how I envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear! < br / > < br / > The cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances : a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suitable for this role ( nowadays she would be probably too mature for it ), Toni Colette is simply great. And then, the breathtaking English countryside, where every situation gets such a magic and dream - like dimension... a really enjoyable and deserving movie. The movie respected this subtle irony, not disregarding the comic element ( Miss Bates above all ). < br / > < br / > "" Emma "" is one of Austen's most delightful and funny novels, thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters.",1
"I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr Knightley - where does one meet such a man??? < br / > < br / > But on watching it again several years ( and many many movies ) later - what a well - crafted little gem this is! and it would have been much more in keeping with rest of the movie. < < < sigh > > > Sophie Thompson's turn as Ms Bates is virtuoso acting of the finest ( oh, napkins, sorry! )",1
"< br / > < br / > The acting is competent. Good, but not brilliant.",1
What the right role can do for you! Emma is a true romance. a good cast.,1
< br / > < br / > Highly recommended. ). I sometimes forget she's American ~!,1
The film is worth watching ( again even ) for her performance alone.,1
"Luckily for her, however, is someone just right for her waiting in the wings. Now, if she can but stop long enough to realize it. It's a pleasant, affecting film, with a wonderful cast, that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place. The world goes round and love abounds, but Emma is about to miss the boat.",1
Emma is that movie.,1
"). The story is often amusing, endearing, and at times, quite touching. That is one of the things I enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the English countryside.",1
"Highly recommended. There could not be more perfect casting, IMO. But real'find'is Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley.",1
The outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children. ( In broken English with English subtitles ).,1
"< br / > < br / > The character who stole the film was MISS BATES!!! One of the most endearing characters I have come across in ages. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. From one of the opening scenes when she is thanking Mr. Woodhouse for sending "" that lovely quarter - hind of pork... PORK, MOTHER!!! "" < br / > < br / > I ADORED it!",1
I love this movie. 2 thumbs up.,1
The sound effects during this were great. Make the World go away.,1
they really work well together! but each to their own! I loved it and highly recommend it!,1
"Yes... This was probably one of the funniest movies I have ever had the chance to watch. Looked interesting, wasn't expecting much though. I was wrong. I'm going with the 1 - 0 on this and here's why.",1
You have to see this!,1
). I was in for a surprise.,1
Enjoy movie. People complain about the movie being too simple or too boring.,1
"And who said that justice isn't served anymore? The judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury. Ya! One of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an Aunt. They often carry out maximum penalties! Not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment. Now they've turned their attention to the court system in Cameroon, Africa. With these 2 behind the bench.",1
"Give it a try, you may just feel same way about it as i do. I loved this film, you just don't get to see gem's like this every day. The two leads are great and really carry the film. This should become a cult favorite.",1
It was very weird and unrealistic. The theme song is sweet! That would have been great!,1
"Tweaked a little bit,'Nothing'could be a children's film. The actors sell it, although you can tell these guys are friends anyway. < br / > < br / > At any rate, this is a reasonably entertaining film, albeit with a few dragged - out scenes. All that's left is what they don't hate, and a big empty white space. If you've seen'Cube ', you know already that he tends to like that type of situation.",1

But that is where even more problems begin.,1
When looking up this movie I found one particular review which urged people NOT to see this film. Just say you hate it and why you hate it... but don't try to tell people that they shouldn't watch it. See NOTHING!,1

"The ending is absolutely incredible! This is one of the films that don't stop for a minute, and that is both a wonder and a pity. The numbers are flawless! There mustn't be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking. And you know what? It's completely crazy!",1
A must see.,1
"Gentility and morality made sure of it. < br / > < br / > Of course Cagney alone does not make Footlight the classic that it is. He is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend. Sadly, the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of Footlight again.",1
"Joan Blondell, ( Nan Prescott ) gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty. Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows. Enjoy. This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs.",1
A wonder. One of the best musicals ever.,1
It sounds it to me. I would love to know.,1
To think that they only started making feature talking pictures 7 years before this!,1
James Cameron!,1
"< br / > < br / > And what's the story line? He starts doing Prologues, live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts.",1
Once again the musical numbers also feature a young Billy Barty. He plays the role with a lot of confidence. This musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie Cagney would star in. His musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really. < br / > < br / > A recommendable early genre movie.,1
"But we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles. Apparently Blondell was the only other woman who Cagney loved apart from his wife. ). Footlight Parade ( 1933 ) "" was one such film that audiences flocked to. And you can see the mutual adoration in every scene.",1

"Wrong. < br / > < br / > In preparation for the prologues, Kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival. Shorts, news reels, serials, and cartoons would later serve the purpose. Could it be that Cagney's character is patterned after Berkeley?",1
It has drama. This is James Cagney at his quisessential BEST! He's fast with his feet!,1
He wished he'd done a few more musicals in his career and I wish he had. One of Blondell's best screen roles. Those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in front. But it's so creative and fun to watch. It gives James Cagney a chance to display some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy.,1
"It's a catalog of'30s Warner Bros. sensibilities. < br / > < br / > The Pre - Code stuff is fun. "" Footlight Parade "" is fascinating on so many levels. In a few months the Production Code would eliminate such naughty pleasures.",1
"And Ruby Keeler is adorable, as always. A thoroughly enjoyable Depression era romp. The overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing. Although Cagney had a solid background in vaudeville, this was the first film in which he showed his dancing talents.",1
"But back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore. But as it is we have the Gershuni - directed film. The atmosphere is a lot grimmer, though, and some comparisons to Nicholas Roeg's and Donald Cammell's PERFORMANCE come to mind.",1

"It is not quite correct to say, as has often been said, that the film is about Pimlico "" declaring itself independent "" of Britain. It can, however, be applied to most of the other films in the series, especially "" Passport to Pimlico "".",1
I don't think this is the point of the film at all.,1
I commend pictures that try something different. The film centers on a tiny neighborhood in London called Pimlico.,1
A definite 10.,1
"With films like "" Passport to Pimlico "" it's not difficult to see why. Amusing from start to finish, the story is always fun and always worth watching.",1

I have to say I totally loved the movie.,1
"I get tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughters constantly being subjected to watch Nickelodeon, Disney and the like. It all seems to be the same old tired cartoons rehashed over and over again. ). My finger stopped channel surfing the moment I heard Harvey's voice. My girls already accept others as they are and don't pick on others for being different.",1

"Henry Thomas was "" great "".",1
Very moving story and worth a look. I love the backwoods feel of this movie.,1

A minimum of strong language and brief but pointed violence make this fairly - safe family viewing.,1
And that's when they meet Ernest Keller. Rent it for a good laugh.,1
"This film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time. Jennifer is fighting with her ( ex? ) Soon Karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover. Vickie stays behind, feeling ill, as the other 2 are off to film their story.",1
"From the moment that "" Keller Junior "" character was introduced, his performance made my jaw drop open and it didn't close until the end of the film. One underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing ( as in : vintage shock - material ), and this is basically what the film thrives on.",1
I rated it an 8 out of 10.,1
"His persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed.

( failed!,1
I would recommend it!,1
In and of itself it is not a bad film. This is one of them.,1
The special and sound effects were awesome. I hardly ever agree with them anyway. I needn't have bothered! I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. ; )... Liam was great as always. I don't know why the critics trashed this movie.,1
I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie. I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great. It was even more scary. The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963.,1
"The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. Overall, I enjoyed it. I just wish it scared me more.",1
There is a double question the movie poses. It seems to be a perfect day for swimming.,1
"Jeopardy "" was fantastic.",1
"Some psychological battling there. It's a mere 70 minutes and doesn't feature many sets, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star, of course.",1
Jaqui It just absolutely rattled me.,1
"Dark Angel is criminally overlooked, and under - rated, and was unfortunatly canceled after only 2 series.",1
I found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get - go.,1
"He was in his way as good an actor as either of them, but he lacked charisma. Stanwyck's glory years were behind her, and yet she could still carry a film, as she proves here. The director, John Sturges, was an up - and - comer whose best years lay ahead.",1
"His character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying "" Pretty neat, huh? "" The friction between them is a hoot. A. Mom tries to trick convict into helping while Dad waits and hangs on for dear life. The plot is about as simple as it gets. ( they're in the middle of nowhere ) and he realizes sitcom - ishly "" Yeah, that's right "". Leonard Maltin must've been watching some other movie. She fires back "" Where would I go? "" when he's especially pleased with his misdeeds.",1
"Does she or doesn't she??. He turns in quite a brilliant performance! Yes, the tide is coming in. Here's an excellent Barbara Stanwyck double bill on one disc. Once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him!

It just makes me feel good. One of my Top 10 films of all time. I LOVE it!,1
"The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much superior in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed delivered. I think her'Let me dance for you scene'is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5 - 6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week.",1
"I mean, take "" A Chorus Line "", a stage play turned into film.",1

"Frankly, their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this. I have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film. * * * of 4 stars. The film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try - out group. Douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part. As many reviewers here have noted, the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story.",1

< br / > < br / > This is a great movie. This is a study of life as a Broadway star. That is an incorrect view.,1
"Ann Heywood was also very good as the cynical Cathie. I don't agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the American International Pictures. The estate looked like an old prison. He finds he is the butt of many jokes. ( He had a very different role in another Stanley Baker film "" Hell Drivers "" ). He wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires. His portrayal of Johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening.",1
Some of the boys are a bit scary.,1
"Time has helped heal those wounds. The tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive. Tsai Chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest Nicole Kidman film'The Interpretor '. This film was shot on location in Gerard Gardens in Liverpool, and was the UK's answer to films such as'Blackboard Jungle '.",1
"This hard - boiled character is a role typical of Baker. < br / > < br / > Thankfully the preachiness of earlier Dearden crime dramas such as'The Blue Lamp'is not so apparent. < br / > < br / > The elder brother of the Murphy family, Johnny, is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums.",1
Richard O'Sullivan is besotted with Paula Wilcox. One of THE comedies of the 1970's. A man and two women. The comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing.,1
Ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate. What a pity modern comedy can't reach that high standard. The obvious ends up happening as he moves in.,1
"While the acting isn't as bad as daytime soap, it isn't of such quality that I'd commend it. This sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series, and it works, but it doesn't quite click if you get my meaning. Perhaps they get filled in with later episodes, but that's beside the point. The fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twenty - eight less minutes.",1
'Nuff said.,1

"In fact the second run of'In Charge'overlapped with the first of'House '. He was born to play the sex - mad Robin. 'Man About The House'was also a flat - sharing sitcom and ran from 1973 - 76. But there must be no naughty business. "".",1
"Well, see the movie yourself to see how it's all resolved. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her! However, the rent is due and there's no money, so the lady is forced to look for work.",1

This is Nicole's movie though, and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance!. Mathieu Kassovitz is OK here, but didn't have much to do. ( Kidman Rules!!!! The ending was very cute, and it's unpredictable throughout!, plus this movie is quite underrated as well!.",1

From the robotic sex, the hustling for gifts, to the lies and betrayal, I've experienced it all in Russia. from website. So check it out. com / Photojournals. They are very cunning, ruthless, and greedy, as well as highly unfair. You can't just order her to arrive at your airport. That's how it works in real life.",1

Maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing. < br / > < br / > I really marveled at Kidman'ability to physically appear Russian. In effect, they teach him to be compete. Instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances.",1
Nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. and Alec is great. It's just too good.,1

This film is definitely an odd love story.,1
"But "" Birthday Girl "" is just the opposite. The man, begin to discover certain things. A film that i heard a lot of times, but i don't dare to see... until two hours of write this. The woman that he finds comes from Russia. Are you a giraffe?... Much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don't novel. And I'm not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece.",1

A task well done! And the acting?... And the Gaelic community? I would highly recommend this movie! Well watch out Richard! Insist that your local cinema puts it on!,1
: o ) But it's a less glamorous and more in you face tale.,1
"The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film. It's all filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather. The mountain scenery is breathtaking, and it's a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken.",1
Archetypes. Where does fiction end? He burns with frustration. The Scots excel at storytelling. Our protagonist introduces himself to us. Magic and mystery. Yet Seach'd is rooted in reality. The same story is told in bars the length and breadth of Scotland. Warning stories. He yearns to know the truth.,1
Finally someone has the sense to create a show for her. The supporting case seems quite good too. It is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well.,1
"One thing I just thought of though. 7 of 10. So for me, The Jane Show is in pretty good company. It's all made at the height of summer, LOL!",1
"Excellent show. Let's be realistic about things, FEW Canadian SHOWS make it. I thought this one would be a winner.",1
Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It is unfortunate that the Challenger Accident delayed and hurt the movie.,1

She already said that she doesn't like bullies. Kate Capshaw is now married to Steven Spielberg. Check out Joaquin Phoenixs other movies also.,1
"since Jessica Alba's carrier sky rocketed after the show. Very good drama in season two. just like the show Firefly, which of course FOX canceled as well.",1

He rides with the firemen to the WTC and goes inside the building. SPOILERS 9 / 11 is a very good and VERY realistic documentary about the attacks on the WTC. As the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident.,1
Amazing documentary.,1
"But, once we got with the gist of the series, we were very quickly hooked. For those who have no choice but to fight, for survival or justice, this series empowers them.",1
"Knowing how serious 9 / 11 really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of 9 / 11. Watch if you can, this is the best documentary I have personally ever seen.",1
"So that's the purpose of adding a story in documentary. How many movies about the World war 2 have we seen? I agree it is wrong trying to make a lot of money out of 9 / 11. Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves. But I also agree that movies are one of best way to tell history. But I don't think narration is unnecessary. I've read most of the comments here. We don't sum up facts like : Birth, Childhood, High School etc. But what if there will be a movie in about 5 years? We create a story about our live. The story is weak, so be it, but we understand whats going on.",1
In my view it would have been better to leave this out.,1
< br / > < br / > Conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way.,1
"< br / > < br / > Jules asked the captain to follow him into the Towers. The first thing he saw was two people on fire, something he refused to film.",1
"It was an accident, and look where it got them. I highly recommend this documentary. I was sick of hearing about it.",1
"I rented this for my son who is recently found interest in 9 / 11. My heart goes out to survivors and families of victims of 9 / 11! Very well done indeed! I liked the way it was told as a "" documentary. "" This movie had nobody known.",1
dark angel rocks! takes like 4 days but it is worth it!,1
Incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over NYC on that fateful morning of September 11th.,1
"Tony is a "" White Cloud. "" Firefighters have a superstition about "" Probies. "" The story was thought up by two French brothers living in New York. Pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the World Trade Center. To sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible.",1
It's all there. There was truly a disturbance in the Force. The feelings are so incredibly visual.,1
This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day. We find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened. < br / > < br / > IMDB asks us to rate this movie. It is art without question or questions. You can keep your kung - fu junk. This is why the art of filming was created! It didn't have a sneak - peek. Romance is cute. The courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable.,1
Tears came to my eyes watching this documentary.,1
"The French have a history of making great documentary's and that is what this is, Great Documentary.....",1
Recommended.,1
"Life and death hang in the balance. That part alone is quite good, and had the documentary been allowed to run its intended course, it probably would have been solid. < br / > < br / > The aftermath, in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found, is human drama at its peak. < br / > < br / > Then of course, all hell breaks loose. The brothers appear to realistically portray process of becoming a NYC firefighter. < br / > < br / > In a filmmaking sense, "" 9 / 11 "" is textbook. Nonpareil * * Warning! < br / > < br / > Bottom Line : The best documentary I've ever seen. Seeing not only the attacks, but also the first - hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion. They were probably added just to attract more television viewers.",1
"From the lobby, it looks, feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firemen look so utterly bewildered and frightened. It is then that an increasingly forlorn Fire Chief Pfeiffer realises that his task is desperate and probably hopeless - and this is before WTC2 collapses. There is also the eery, haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the portico outside. Tony looks proud.",1
"Few minutes later, he told me there was another, and that the WTC was under attack. < br / > < br / > No, this documentary didn't set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9 / 11.",1
!,1
"Someone came into the locker room shouting "" Some building just got bombed in New York! My roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her. Those firemen in this documentary showed courage, confusion, and strength, the real raw human emotions. But I don't think we thought about what they were really going though. A few minutes later, we heard about the Pentagon and that there was a plane headed for Chicago but was shot down. "".",1
"Quite simply, the footage deserves to be preserved for all time. But what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer. What must the cameraman have been thinking at this time? The camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers. How wrong I was.",1
"This is NOT propaganda, in fact it is hardly political at all. I was wrong. Highly recommended.",1
! Want more?,1
"A thin story with many fine shots. And, to a lesser extent, the guy accompanying them.",1
Alberto Sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories. So Rodolfo Sonego did. You can see his humor in all his movies. GREAT I found a copy of this movie on DVD recently.,1
"Something rang a bell and I clicked on it, and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories. < br / > < br / > I've found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a "" great "" comedy.",1
John Candy has a field day as the bon vivant. Just a nice pick me up for a dreary day. Delightful ensemble cast.,1
"He's making good money, but like thousands of others, he's tired of living in a cramped urban "" cave "". I don't know if writers Panama and Frank got an Oscar, but they should have. At the time, RKO was turning out classic noirs by the dozens. Yet, oddly, the film appears to have no comedic high - point. That's a real movie triumph for any era.",1
The plot is well - written and the cast was knockout.,1
!,1
Enjoy The Movie. That's How Good It Is.,1
"Because it's sincere, moving, funny and true. Thanks, Luciano!",1
"But he succeeds in making a good product. Radiofreccia "" is still a good surprise in Italian cinema.",1
"Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. The movie doesn't take a happy or sad approach on things, it just tells us a story, one that all of us could have experienced. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and grief.",1
"A classic cartoon, always enjoyable and funny. I would definitely buy it if they did, and if they do, you should buy it too. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find.",1
It's never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions.,1
"The show was hilarious to say the least. The action was mesmerizing, and cleverly set up.",1
"It even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds Mike and renders him uncertain * how * to react. The "" story "" comes off as more of an afterthought.",1
I enjoyed this movie.,1
Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was funny.,1

we would watch it all the time.,1
"bye. ( senior in high school ). Big rock candy mountain is amazing. i watched it when i was little, and still do to this day. little bunny foo foo is the man. i recommend that people of all ages watch this movie.",1
"When I was little, my parents got this movie for me to watch. Some parts I found quite entertaining. I really liked it, and I watched it over and over again. I would recommend this.",1
"One look at HGTV's programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today. However, the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one. < br / > < br / > With his double takes and flawless line delivery, Grant "".",1
"That's all it was meant to do and it does so. If not, then don't waste your time. 8 / 10 However, it's a fun little movie that gets job done : it entertains.",1
"Eric Norris, son of Chuck is the director. The old master teachs to young aspirant. < br / > < br / > Chuck Norris have many plans for future.",1
Good story plot. A GREAT!,1
There are a few spoilers in this comment!!,1
I hope you take time to view this movie!,1
"I gave film 7 / 10. Judson took over most of the action, leaving Joshua ( chuck ) with Que on her computer.",1
It has a lot of adventure in it. It is a great follow up to President's Man. My personal opinion.,1
"The sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit, but never raunchy or tedious. Recommended viewing for Sarno fans.",1
"This film is Sarno classic. First saw this gem from Joe Sarno way back when, and I must say that after seeing it, I could never forget Jennifer Welles. Her presence in this film is hard to avoid, and spices up every scene she's involved in.",1
"She's way sexier. A time when it was in to be a swinger. < br / > < br / > I also digged Chris Jordan's Anna. Another classic film only on Drive - In Classics, the best $ 2. 50 CAN a month you can spend. It's not real but it feels real.

"This film, I think, is a small thank you.",1
"Yes, you read right. She has a gorgeous, but lethal vagina! This film is totally fantastic!! The school is lead by incredibly funny looking ( just look at the costume! ) < br / > < br / > The most hilarious thing in this film is how Keko Mask kills her enemies.",1
"Everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it. I turned this on to see the incredible Ethel Waters, whose autobiography I am now reading.",1
"He plays Rufus Jones, a young boy who is being consoled by his Mammy. It is really well done and very entertaining. I believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us. They depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist Baptist church. For entertainment value I found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant. He is told'Why some day you could be President '. It clearly marks a moment time for our collective consciousness.",1
"Now, many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title.",1
very good for a laugh. the guts and entrails were actually very convincing.,1

"The girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat. This is THE spoiler. So, the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture - stream, but the main story! We don't see that she is alone. I was also astonished when I saw that the Brazilian - Portuguese title of this movie means "" Voyage into Death "". How mistaken can one be!",1
"I also saw this upon its release in'56, and have been struck since then with its final scene. If this is an answer to'High Noon,'then it's an apt and apposite response.",1
I'd never see or heard of him before this film. Conrad plays a terrific part in this film.,1
Kirk follows him. They humiliate Sinatra and run him out of town. Pity for some reason this has not been seen for years. She's the daughter of storekeeper Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams.,1

I thoroughly enjoyed this film.,1

Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed. Loy is adorable as his pre - NOW wife. Art Direction and Editing are way above par.,1
For music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny.,1

Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap. I know I don't. It was hilarious.,1
It's trippy. But I felt Juliet Aubrey's performance was gorgeous. Bruce Robinson was awesome. Helena was a lovely girlfriend. The scenes between Aubrey & Robinson killed me! They ought to!,1
"< br / > < br / > Ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it. < br / > < br / > Every performance is absolutely perfect. But all the actors are equally brilliant. It's a gem. He has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him. I was dancing in the living room to "" All Over the World. "" I spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it. I know I didn't.",1
"Indeed, it's been popular to put down that era of music, and see punk as a welcome antidote to it. There are couple of plot points which don't work, but overall this is quite enjoyable.",1
"So I rented it. So I rented "" Still Crazy "" instead.",1
But he wants them to start touring again first. He sets off in search of the other members of the band. And so they hit the club circuit around Europe. It was at that festival in the 70's that Strange Fruit broke up. They launch a comeback / reunion tour.,1

"Well - known Rockers are getting old and forgotten, not the music. Why? Far much better than Spinal Tap for instance. Like anyone of us. Have you ever danced on Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock? Because in Still Crazy, people are mature. What a good movie!",1
Why mess with original? He invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad his somewhat similar turn in'Love Actually'brought him more attention. It was interesting to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer.,1

This has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war. The current Chairman, Whistle ( Chung Wang ) has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland China and the race is on to see who can recover it first. Both films are gangster epics that are similar in form. < br / > < br / > Much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the Baton.",1
"The pacing is relatively slow and deliberate. And I'm not talking about the glossy, glamour version of Hollywood violence. Fans of gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect. This is dark and grim.",1
It'a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film.,1
"Very good! So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. Also starring Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr.",1
"< br / > < br / > To be continued... Well, war is not going to happen as that is bad for business.",1
It's a great film for Cary Grant fans or for whole family.,1
"Personally, I find the movie to be quite a good watch. Another good watch would be Dragon Squad.",1
It's the battle of the wits that makes Election stands out of the rest. Lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years. Election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by Johnnie To. He ordered his man to get the Baton before it falls onto the hands of Lok.,1
This film really deserves more recognition than its getting. The film is shot beautifully and delves into all you're classic crime themes such as betrayal and power.,1
"< br / > < br / > Loved it. In short, there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth. I am certain this was intended as humour.... hoping this was intended as humour. Go see it!",1

"Scary Movie?? ! The Impossible Princess was Queen of the screen! Well this is Aussie, and original!!!",1
I enjoyed it. I didn't even think it was really a spoof of other movies.,1
I thought that the movie was pretty good.,1
There is so much to love in this darling little comedy. But the best performance is Grant's.,1
"< br / > < br / > Cut has atmosphere. < br / > < br / > No need to say "" don't take it seriously "" or "" so bad its good "" or "" it wasn't scary "". A fun somewhere. None of these comments are relevant.",1
"Good soundtrack, too. If there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send - up of or a homage to the slasher genre. This also neatly - okay, messily - disposes of Kylie Minogue in the first reel. The rest of the cast fit their roles well, especially the lovely Jessica Napier, who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her. It also has appropriate low budget look, including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate. Cut "" is a full - tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do. Probably a bit of both. "" They are joined by one of the survivors of the original film, played by Molly Ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines.",1
"This is not a bad movie. Cut hits all the marks, and is actually scary in some parts.",1

This is surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable and well made, with some decent gore!. Overall well worth watch!. The acting is solid!. Kylie Minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role. Kimble Rendall does a good!",1
"however there are some good positives in this film. if you not, than it just might grate on you. i enjoyed it and had some fun. so, i have to give "" Cut "" 8 / 10, which may seem too high to some people. there are a few concerns about this movie.",1
"I'm surprised that this one never got a sequel, but I guess it simply came out too late. Now, Cut is not the best slasher flick ever, and nor does it try to be. End of spoilers. < br / > < br / > Suspenseful Australian slasher flick with very few scares. Well, they're about to find out that some curses are real. The killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer!",1

Guess what happens next? The students ignore that. People who try and finish it are killed themselves. I give it a 7. It's about a masked killer. No one is great but no one is terrible either.,1
OK? There really IS something for everyone. This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone.,1

And it was funny. This movie is better than 4. Come on people.,1
I like Ben Afleck. I thought the television version was a bit edited way down.,1
Only if. It was fun and funny movie.,1
I would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it. I rate it right up there with Christmas vacation.,1

"I enjoyed it. This movie isn't as bad as I heard. Take it for what is it, a Christmas comedy with a love twist.",1
I laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt. Gandolfini gives his typical A performance. Go see it and have a good laugh!,1

"I highly recommend this. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. If you don't fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.",1
"Or simply, something that will make you think. It was heart - breaking, disturbing, and inspiring all in one.",1
"As a result, the acting is understated and implicit, as opposed to overt and explicit. Dialogues are sparing, with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters'inner conflicts, doubts, or feelings. Angelopoulos'genius through Arvanitis'camera is on display throughout the film.",1
One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. Truth be told he's kind of sweet on Myrna and Cary knows it. The problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand.,1
"( Hence the spoiler. ) It's an "" art movie "" in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention. Due to the overall photographic style, large screen viewing is recommended. < br / > < br / > Dialogues are used sparingly.",1
Paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important.,1
"Of course, let's not lie. < br / > < br / > Is Myrna Loy missed? Still, it is a wonderfully fun, highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein. However, I'd be hard - pressed to name a better substitute than Jean Arthur.",1
"I suspect the writer had something else in mind - say, the wacky side of Carole Lombard. < br / > < br / > Definitely worth watching, as William Powell and Jean Arthur always were. And this isn't the first time she's done that! It seems that Powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed. I've been waiting for police to take a hand in it, "" it's more of a rib to Powell rather than a serious statement. It still works well, and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own.",1
"Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably closest thing to the "" perfect man. "" There seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks! Jean Arthur SHINES when she looks at Powell. My friends thought the same. Okay, this is sounding way too gushy, but I can't help myself.",1
So by this time he was pretty well set in the role. This is after he comes to Bill Powell for help. They succeeded to some degree.,1
"Eric Blore also has some comic turns as Powell's butler. They are extremely fun to watch, so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold.",1

He would go on to be in Super Ninjas. Meng Lo plays yet another bad ass.,1
I loved this film.,1
I don't recall where I saw it. I was really bummed.,1
"In short, not much happens. Wrong. But the plot I heard was so great, was so predictable. Plus, the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie. The fighting is all pretty routine.",1
I remember lots of them. Then the movie began.,1
This movie is really good.,1
"< br / > < br / > Watch it soon! It lost NONE of it's original kung fu coolness! ! Now I am 26 years old, and my friend has it on DVD!!",1
It is fun to see how their styles match up against each other. I really like this movie. < br / > < br / > The story is very interesting. It doesn't get any better than this.,1
"The story is well told, and complete. Heck, my wife even enjoyed it. See this one at all costs. Throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself one heck of a movie.",1
"This film is breath of fresh air in comparison. The plot is interesting and twisty, the characters are cool each with their own style - toad, snake, lizard etc.",1
"Its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention. Its indicative of nothing, its just something that struck me. ) We're given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is. < br / > < br / > Around 7 out of 10. < br / > < br / > Classic martial arts film has title that even many non - fans know.

"), this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work. The same thing happens in genre film - making, as well ; though, again, I'm referring to movies made outside the U. $. In its own right as fascinating as any other genre - based whodunit ( western, cop show, etc. To this very day, there hasn't been a pay - per - view channel to feature Asian martial artists playing Asian martial artists in Asia. As for television : forget it.",1
"But, Blandings asks himself every few minutes, how long is long? You decide. Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed. < br / > < br / > This movie is a delight. With television looming on the horizon, Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time.",1
"). So what makes this movie so special? The influence has also carried into other areas as well, from music such as the Wu - Tang Clan, TV commercials for Sprite and video games such as "" Mortal Kombat. "" The formula proved so popular The twist is that since the clan always wears masks, not all of them known who the others are.",1
"It's known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story. There's no romance or other side plot to this movie, it's action and intrigue all the way, making it a real man's kung - fu movie. < br / > < br / > One movie you must watch if you are a kung - fu movie fan.",1
A map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the Scorpion but know one knows who he is. While most martial arts films deal with revenge Chang did not use that as a central theme.,1
"Each character has different traits, characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Sadly, you won't find all of these aspects together in one kung - fu movie, EXCEPT for Five Deadly Venoms! We learn along with him. Once you get yer mitts on it, it'll change the way you look at kung - fu flicks. It's worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that'going on. One is the Centipede, two is the Snake, three is the Scorpion, four is the Lizard, and five is the Toad.",1
< br / > < br / > I can't say enough about the choreography or the camera work. !,1
"Well, I must say that this was one hell of a fun movie. But stick with it, and you won't be disappointed! < br / > < br / > The one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence.",1
It all follows tragedy / noir arc.,1
"Still though this movie is one of Shaw Brothers best and is quite enjoyable. This movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into vibe. The ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more. 8 out of 10 on the scale. It somehow leaves you wanting something, you want more.",1
Such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema.,1
< br / > < br / > Poison Clan rocks! However the plot certainly is better than average.,1
Some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching. We actually care when people are killed in this film.,1
"The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show worried me at first. However, the rest of cast is extremely sub - par in comparison.",1
So disgusting. Talk about a movie of year!,1
"But in all seriousness, it was good.",1
The Sarah Silverman program. < br / > < br > Go watch and see.,1
Best show since Seinfeld. She's really really funny.,1
Early reviews are suggesting next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so I can't wait to see how this show unfolds.,1
"It gets flat very fast. Personally I love the program, but there are some huge faults with it. it is nothing like those shows. Not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good, the music, well, isn't. Give it a shot.",1
"This may be the most creative, original and experimental TV program ever. Every time she speaks it's like a self - contained 5 second skit.",1
It has that same flow and that same rhythm.,1
"When I first saw this show, I thought it looked interesting. I got it, but wasn't laughing very much. Then I got to see her movie, Jesus is Magic. It will get canceled before it's time and live on in fans'hearts and on DVD.",1
"Her show won't change the World, nor is it meant to. The best kind of comedy around.",1
Nothing that appears on T. V. is an accident. Who plays Sarah's sister? The cast is awesome.,1
Check it out!,1
"Completely outrageous. She never skips a beat. Thank you, Comedy Channel! I'm a happy guy.",1
"I shall explain. - That is funny stuff in my book. Sarah can come at you from odd angles. In another episode, her affair with God was notably funny. < br / > < br / > Then, came the second season. he asks. """,1
"For those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity, you are in fact the mindless one. You just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it. < br / > < br / > What I also love is that not everything is a punchline.",1
com. This show probably won't appeal to everyone. This kind of stuff is future of entertainment.,1
"This show is finally something new and interesting and ( most importantly ) funny! If you don't know that she's ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints, you don't get it. I can't say that about many TV shows... can you?",1
"At least we have Grey Gardens to remember them! Even after watching it for the first time, I was hooked.",1
"It's a look at high society from the darker side, and it is utterly fascinating. How can you improve on this? It is certainly a strange one - like rubbernecking at a highway accident. This film was done after that rescue.",1
Edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56. DVD and VHS. It is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out. The outfits Edie comes up with a very clever and creative. Grey Gardens sounded very interesting. Hmmm... Then I got to looking at their body of work. Worrying too much about things.,1
"). Facets does, though. ( i. e. "" Are they nuts?",1
"And both Edith and Edie just love the idea of being filmed. They cannot help being one singer, the other the dancer. This as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation.",1
"Let me take care of you! "" Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for. The world will never know what have happened if she didn't listen to her mom's plea, "" Come home, Edie! Even though their house was filthy, this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness.",1
Cats loll about while mother Edith insults her daughter's elocution. Grey Gardens is a world unto itself.,1
I was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was. Two thumbs way up!,1
Grey Gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn't really look away. The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre.,1
"Both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age. Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? It did, but it also prompted me to rent the movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > Love it. This film is no "" guilty "" pleasure.",1
The content is pretty much made up of two things. Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever. Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.,1
This is film you will not soon forget.,1
It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. Unforgettable. It now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films.,1
"They couldn't live together, nor apart. See this one.",1
Why should you watch this?,1
"I got to get to a hotel room. "" Remember me? """,1
In a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a'cult '. This is why i so love this website! I saw this film in the 1980's on British television.,1
(! ) The expanded Chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out.,1
"It is rare experience that you must see for yourself. And their lives an example of drive, determination and free - will. < br / > < br / > The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love.",1
"< br / > < br / > At its heart, this documentary is incredibly sad. Her mother seems more resigned to her fate, to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions. While neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life, the squalor they live in is utterly awful. And of course there are numerous cats running around. The older Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the younger is her first cousin.",1
"But other than that, the movie's a hoot. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs as Jim's and Muriel's lawyer Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he's making clear. The builders, contractors, and others also provide their fair share of laughs.",1
"It's shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire Bouvier family. The sound, even on the Criterion re - release is poor and difficult to follow. I saw this film a couple of weeks ago, and it's been stuck in my head ever since. They were living in dangerous, unhealthy, unsafe conditions. It stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary.",1
"These women talk and talk and talk, mostly about past, and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, except to them. < br / > < br / > What a strange film. It won ' and who knows what else.",1

Cypher "" is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in America in the not too distant future. Upon successfully completing his first assignment, Sullivan / Thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered. Lucy Liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak - and - dagger tone. I was also very impressed with Jeremy Northam.",1
"Or was it? But this was 1948 : Communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner. Politics in the movie? Modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake, "" The Money Pit. "" In real life, too, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, a Democrat, and a feminist. Jason Robards,r., has a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable.",1
"Although one could immediately label the film a science fiction, there is a little more to it. Cypher is a clever, effective and eerie film that delivers.",1
< br / > < br / > The character development is intentionally shallow.,1
"The whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good.",1
"The viewer has to WATCH him and Think as this story unfolds. It's sedate because that's what the Main Character is. But they all fit, and they entertain. < br / > < br / > Take it from there. < br / > < br / > Then it begins to accelerate. You must be patient and instead, note the details here.",1
This is a fantastic movie! This is my first comment! How wrong.,1

And Jeremy Northam. although saying this is spoilment enough. I don't recommend that to anyone.,1
Walt D in LV WOW. Anyone could have played it. < br > < br / > Incredible!,1
"Trust me, it's actually less complicated than it sounds and director Vincenzo Natali ( the dude from "" Tube "" ) carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters. Jeremy Even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60's film, with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless. Cypher "" is a pretty inventive Sci - Fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright & claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible. Sunways, on the other hand, constantly tries to unmask the Digisoft - rats and recruit them again as double - spies.",1
Wow! Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster ( played by Lucy Liu )? How will Morgan get himself out of this? The twist is so much fun! What a nifty movie! It is very suspenseful and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive.,1

Just wonderful.,1
If you can enjoy story of real people and real love - this is a winner.,1
"Watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it! < br / > < br / > If you're looking for action, you should turn away. This is pure psychology.",1
"Cypher is such a film. < br / > < br / > Morgan Sullivan ( Jeremy Northam ), one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet, is hired by the company DigiCorp. To his bewilderment, they are unbelievably boring. She gives him the brush - off, but there is something to her he finds irresistible. And I'm not saying anything more about the plot. It framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube, shot entirely on one set, and took this idea in fascinating directions. It is so refreshing in this day and age to see a SF film that has more than one idea in it's head. Covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese.",1
"Morgan, along with his fellow conference attendees, is being brainwashed. In an exciting finale, all eventually becomes clear ( but only if you've been following events very carefully ). Morgan plays along, and applies for a job at rival business Sunways.",1
"Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. There is nothing wrong with or cheap about Cypher whatsoever. Nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction. I cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is. Naturally, I won't give anything away. This is not a spoiler. In fact, I've recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie. Hands down and hats off. Don't listen to the haters. Cypher is not, I repeat not, a B movie. Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made. The future is now.",1

The conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies. He finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for Digicorp.",1
This Filmfour funded Sci - Fi movie is most definitely a must see.,1
"His offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit, done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face, neck and lips. The extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi "" film noir "" in the tradition of many classic thrillers. The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and appropriately driving at times. No matter the brainwashing, love has a way of persevering.",1
"< br / > < br / > Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious ( as always ). Still, it did. I think she's pretty underrated as a serious talent. I would have given this film 10 / 10, however some of the shots were pretty fake looking. However, as he changes throughout the film, it's like night and day. He's suave and cultured.",1
"Loy is a always a joy to watch. Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, a particular favorite of mine. The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are near perfect. He is so good at playing the put upon husband. And that's where the comedy comes in. He's hoping to find the simple life.",1

"Good action show, but nothing new. Not a bad picture, but just same ol ', same o '.",1

"All in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. Stallone even managed to get out - acted by a horse! < br / > < br / > So forget your better judgement, who cares if'that could never happen ', lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy!",1
But to compare Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a far - fetched notion. The forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end.,1
This movie is just great.,1
The pacing of the movie was a little slow but good outweighs the bad in this one. If you're a big fan of Harlins or Stallone's than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. For the sake of the film though I willing to suspend my disbelief. The villains are solid but it would've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them. The deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable.,1
"A film that entertains through some suspense, good action - sequences, and a nice snowy mountainous setting. Although the rest of the action is exciting and fun, the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film. Oh, yes : and the unintentional humour. This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell. DO THESE GANGSTERS WANT THEIR MON And then we have some more bad dialog, and after that some more great action. A video - game? After landing, our master - criminals seek for a guide and end up with Stallone and Rooker. Nothing. The entire action is one big absurdity, but it's mindless fun at its best. Even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb ( "" tango - tango "" ).",1
This is an action movie at it's BEST.,1
"THis guy knows about action. Big Mistake! The special effect are great and spectacular. And it'particularly good in this movie. Die Hard 2, The long kiss good bye, etc. The more I see it, the more I like it.",1

"So far as I know, no one was killed in the making of this movie ( a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts ), so obviously a dummy was used for the shot. Cliffhanger is "" Die Hard on a mountain, "" and pretty good, for what it is. But the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how Harlin ( or more likely one of the second - unit directors < br / > < br / > The next impressive set - piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet.",1

"It also moves rather slowly, which may bore people.",1
The best part of this movie is that it is subtle. The horror you create in your own mind. I was hooked from beginning to end. What would my personal horror be? It's the opposite.,1

"My vote is seven. One night, Carrère finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell.",1
I just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale. That leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light. Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint.,1
"We're inside a ramshackle French prison cell with four occupants. Good horror movies from France are quite rare, and it's fairly easy to see why! ticket to the States to remake "" The Hills Have Eyes "" ( which he did terrifically, I may add ).

"After translating part of it, they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls. After a short while in the cell together, they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal. It's fair to say that Maléfique makes the best of it's assets as despite it's restraints, the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout. French horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as Inside and Switchblade Romance bursting on to the scene.",1
It has a real life ring to it. I'm actually hearing the gong now every time I do something self - destructive. Maléfique is a very interesting movie.,1
"It has my favorite kind of gore too, supernatural and splattery.",1
< br / > < br / > Scary with some gore this is well worth viewing.,1
"Only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell, a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed, closed - in nature of proceedings elsewhere. More than anything, this is a film about being trapped, either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding. """,1
"Melvyn Douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well, never hitting a single wrong note. an ad for a house.",1
"Well, magic works in mysterious ways.",1
"< br / > < br / > Director Eric Valette makes a great use of atmosphere, mood and his cast to give life to the plot. "" Despite its obvious lack of budget, he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original, fresh and very attractive.",1

My siblings and I stumbled upon The Champions when our local station aired re - runs of it one summer in the 1970's. But wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it. We absolutely adored it.,1
Just like Richard Barrat. The box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about series.,1
"What if Tremayne had learned of the Champions'powers? Would Craig and Richard have been competitors for Sharron's affections? We never found out, alas.",1
I just order the DVD ( 15 episodes ). By far it was my favorite. The actors were very credible.,1
"< br / > < br / > The film begins with Bill's life falling to pieces.

However, her pseudo - hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date.",1

Myrna Loy, was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite Mr. Grant. < br / > < br / > Jim Blandings, a Madison Ave. executive, has had it! The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but doesn't have much to do. The worst one is the lack of closet space!",1
Really liked one.,1
There is also a great cameo by Ben Vereen.,1
This comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail.,1
"And the big surprise, this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity.",1

"Aside from a few titles and the new Sherlock Holmes movie, I think I've watched every movie Guy Ritchie has directed. Twice. Needless to say, I'm a big fan and Revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why. When he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from Macha, Jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease that's left him with three days to live.",1

"Jake goes to prison, and spends five years with the con and the chess masters. it's all very simple. 10 / 10, no doubt.",1
I have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life. I absolutely loved this film and i can't wait to see it again.,1
"But then, nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew, especially one using the gangster / con - artist movie framework. Not worth starting a new religion over, but I'm surprised it didn't get a US distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary?",1
"However, this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time. The majority of reviews that i had read, said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow. I think it's fantastic, and that Guy Ritchie is a director on top of his game.",1
"I will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone! The fact is it wasn't what anyone was expecting, especially from Guy Ritchie. etc, but this is far more mature than his previous works.",1
"< br / > < br / > It definitely wasn't perfect though. The script was extremely well done, and the soundtrack, as with most Guy Ritchie films, was great. This movie definitely kept my interest, with one great, suspenseful, action packed, scene after another. That was cool.",1
A superb movie! I watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away.,1
"First time. If you see it you'll know what I mean. If not, well, no - one ever said "" Revolver "" is for everyone. And that'my 2 cents.",1

"I love the mafia and crime genre in film and I enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds, but this is so much more. < br / > < br / > James Gandolfini domineers the show as Tony, one of the most groundbreaking characters on TV ever. < br / > < br / > Edie Falco matches the power of Gandolfini's performance as Tony's wife Carmela.",1
"), Joe Pantoliano ( great! Watch it... ), David Proval ( good ), Robert Patrick, Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent. When The Sopranos hits the mark, it really hits the mark.",1
Well... easily my favourite TV series ever.,1
< br / > < br / > Every character represents a facet of American industry. The convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward.,1
Just my opinion. So this film isn't for a world audience.,1
"The integral use of psychiatry coupled with Tony's mother issues are especially fresh and humorous. People aren't as stupid as some of you make out.... < br / > < br / > Not everything is perfect however. Most of the writers and actors are Italian - American, would they attack themselves? In both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes ).",1
< br / > < br / > If you haven't already you most definitely should.,1
It's almost as entertaining as pro wrestling.,1
It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems. It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce. 3.,1
"She is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then Tony himself. She is simply put, his savior. A sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles.",1
Brendan Filone is # 1 for me. He was killed on a boat by Tony.,1
"At this point in the show's existence, it's being considered a cult - classic and rightfully so. And it's not just him. "" The first two seasons were extraordinary. He, however, does do a hell of a job playing the part of Tony Soprano.",1
"All things considered I could make an elaborate statement on the series, but I won't. The "" gangster "" genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody.",1
"Also Michael Imperioli who plays Christopher, representing the younger ( 20 - 30 ) generation in crime. All acting is powerful and characters complex, but the two who stand out the most are ; James Gandolfini who'is'Tony Soprano. Every little detail builds the perfect TV series. So the Sopranos is definitely the Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp fiction of TV Each character unfolds more and more each series.",1
My comment ended a while ago.,1
"Anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Wow. < br / > < br / > Pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the "" jack - off fantasies "" AJ derides ( and then into which he promptly subsides ). The best TV ever. A tip of the pork pie to Mr. Chase. I LOVED the whole series, and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly.",1
"These guys were definitely best of their generations and even more. As a guy who has seen all the seasons, I can say that JG constantly surprises me. Can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance?",1
"That's why I watch. < br / > < br / > I also love Malaprop's. "" We've been totally spoiled now.",1
It's perfect! It has the same quality as GodFather!,1
Many of issues we see on the show are very real. Yes. < br / > < br / > Simply exceptional.,1
"This show is also very versatile. This is what television should be. Right here. For me, it's a show about family.",1
"Centering around the life of one Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history. Forget Family Redifined. The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous.",1
"Once again, Joe is conned and before long is homeless. He emulates cowboy actors like Roy Rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women. Of course, at that time X meant Maturity. < br / > < br / > I want to make some comments about the movie itself.",1
They can't get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party. It is like a trip through humanity.,1
"I didn't at all think of it this way, but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title "" Midnight Cowboy "" was a gay porno. < br / > < br / > Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, called "" Ratso "" by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time. I'm walkin < br / > < br / > The movie was great, and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies I can't even remember because they're all crap. You don't have to steal it. """,1
"John, if you ever see this, thanks for giving us the Killer Tomatoes. BUT SO WHAT! < br / > < br / > What can you say about Jon De Bello? ). This is a great example of a good, dumb movie. Oh that the former Miss Netherlands had had more of a film career! No, it is not high art by any means. Like co - creator John De Bello, Rockwell works both in front of and behind camera in this series.",1
< br / > < br / > It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. < br / > < br / > Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself.,1
"Anyway, this considered an all - time great for a reason. Otherwise he may have been typecast after the Graduate. < br / > < br / > I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role. After actually seeing it, however, I'm not surprised anymore. I think Voight captured the naivete and the viciousness - when - provoked.",1
"This is one of the greatest films ever made. They become thieves. The sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be. Their story is devastating to watch, but is ultimately important for people to see. It is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other. However, the film doesn't try to guilt trip you. Joe is shook up by a haunting childhood. Instead, it shows you the rough side of lifestyle of hustling.",1
I didn't : that's because it's so real to me. Who is to judge? I'm all for that! < br / > < br / >.... and am not the least bit ashamed.,1
We learn upon his arrival that Joe is laughably naïve in the sex trade.,1
"Also, for those interested, Andy Warhol's apprentice Paul Morrissey shows up briefly during party scene. Check it out. < br / > < br / > If you haven't seen this movie, it is essential.",1
The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece. No wonder it was a huge success when initially released.,1
"As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. By today's standards, it would be hard pressed to pull an R rating.",1
"It's raw, painful, and realistic but very entertaining. Midnight Cowboy is not for everybody. Sadly, Buck is trying to escape from his past life in Texas.",1
"< br / > < br / > But even in this final quest, two are losers. Symbolic of the "" end of innocence "" in American films, since it was the only X - rated film to win a Best Picture Oscar.",1
"Her film career never quite took off, though.",1
"This was certainly how I first came to hear of it, and, to be completely honest, I didn't really expect much of the film. Though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent, Ratso is just as naïve as Joe.",1
"Everyone is recognizably human, warts and all, and everyone is treated sympathetically. < br / > < br / > The film became famous and infamous almost overnight.",1
"We feel for his struggle to fit in, but also to merely get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. Just kidding. Very compelling and sensationally creative film that I highly recommend. < br / > < br / >.",1
This is one hell of a great movie. Must have been'70 when I saw it.,1
"He is singing a cowboy song, the very thing he strives to be. His subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out. Rat In one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick. Joe is a handsome, strong man who, for most part, has a good outward appearance.",1
"WestSide Story had dealt with Racism by a love feast in an artistic view. Accordingly, Joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality ; and Ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into Florida. They begin sharing everything in life. Thence, "" Midnight "" gives the factual sight. Besides Ratso helps Joe to find his way to do whatever he can. < br / > < br / > Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy.",1
Fascinating downer about a would - be male hustler in New York City forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled con - man.,1
"The film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lee's "" Brokeback Mountain "". The two become dependent on one another, and Rizzo begins to manage Joe.",1
They live in an empty and very filthy apartment. ' It does not work out as he planned. The editing in this movie is great.,1
We know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this. Joe Buck ( Jon Voight ) decides he's going to leave his small life in Texas and make it big in the Big City.,1
Nina Simone comes to mind. The two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers. At the time I recall being quite startled and amused by this movie. ( Hi Skip.,1
"that aren't important. I sort of feel this way about "" Easy Rider. "" < br / > < br / > Other than that, "" Midnight ( Although it, too, is one of my favorites. ) I sat down to watch "" Midnight Cowboy "" thinking it would be another overrated'60s /'70s movie.",1
"Surprisingly it was only rated M15 + ( the uncut version ). At a time when the cinema What makes the film interesting is two characters are so different. The main character is Joe Buck, a'cowboy'from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute. At the time ( And even now ) it was definitely not a typical movie ( quite art - house ).",1
Midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools.,1
"In NYC, JB meets up with frustration, and with "" Ratso "" Rizzo, a scruffy but cordial con artist.",1
< br / > < br / > Score : 10 out of 10. I recommend this film to everyone.,1
"But will they make it? < br / > < br / > Very dark, disturbing yet fascinating movie. I'm giving it a 10. < br / > < br / > A great film - - - but very dark. Director John Schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of NYC and its inhabitants.",1
"But this one I can live with. It started the careers of such talents as Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May, and Josh Blue. I do like stand up comedy, so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests. when other comics clearly should've beaten them out. Then one will be determined as "" Last Comic Standing. """,1
"Horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn't always win out over imagination. This is where imagination wins out over fact. Again, I am not sure who this woman < br / > < br / > John Cassevetes plays Dr. Sam Cordell.",1
"The great John Cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town. The murder scenes are intense and gory, so this isn't a film for the squeamish!",1
"It's not our fault when sometimes temptation can't be resisted, that's just who we are.",1
"I saw this film at a local art cinema, in revival form, shortly after it tanked in mainstream cinemas. Perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline.",1
< br / > < br / > Highly recommended. This is a very funny movie!,1
It all creates a very vivid picture of a life that's long gone. Apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in Beery's saloon.,1
I love this freekin movie!,1
"Four words account for why this film was made - "" She Done Him Wrong "".",1
"Swipes "" enjoys throwing rocks through windows in Chinatown, on one occasion setting a laundry alight. A minor but admirable little film. ( Brodie does make the leap, but only because a subterfuge with a dummy fails at the last moment. ) Exploding cigars provide a running gag. """,1
- it's still a cause of argument! Brodie's legendary ( did he do it? Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest both the boys are pursuing.,1
The very first shot might be startling. And he has a soft spot for ornery orphan Cooper.,1
it still in a general area wasn't that good. don't expect something from a movie that it isn't. i mean making the gage evil and how he kills Jud is genius.,1
"There is something about Pet Sematary that I never felt anywhere else. Like I said, sometimes dead is better!",1
First of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind. The acting is also great and i love the cast. !,1
"Pet Semetary I found to be creepy a little. This one, has a lot of them.",1
"Maybe not. Soon enough, Ellie Creed's cat, Church, is found dead. Then, of course, we have the conclusion. Later, Louis is greeted ( not so politely ) by Church. Non Horror fans will want to avoid this. Maybe he was buried alive.",1
This really captures the heart of the book. ( out of 10 ) Fred Gwynne is WONDERFUL.,1
"It´s like an appetizer for a good party! Nowadays I´m kind of hooked to this film. But when you´re nine you just don´t care about those facts. I have to see this maybe once in a month, and on every new year´s eve I watch this with a 12 - pack of beer & bunch of friends.",1
"The acting is actually first rate for a film like this. The heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect. And the results are horrifying. Maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. Despite warning, or even past history. I disagree. < br / > < br / > Maybe. Maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath?",1
7. Highly recommended for genre fans.,1
"Could Pascow prevent this tragedy? "" Pet Sematary "" succeeds on two major situations. Second, it's an emotional, clever movie overall. a tragic event changes the movie's atmosphere, now it turns very dark. < br / > < br / > Probably, the best adaptation to any of King's novels. First, it's a scary Horror movie. You won't regret. But that's just my opinion.",1
"Patti Smith is missing in action, but not Sandra. I wanted to meet her after the show, give her something that meant something to me, that, hopefully would mean something to her. See, the thing is, Bernhard plays by her own rules.",1
Making a book into a movie by following the story page - by - page is NEVER a good idea.,1
"This is one of the creepiest, scariest and most heartbreaking horror movie EVER!",1
"And the "" No fair "" uttered by little Miko Hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance.",1
"Not to say the movie is bad, because it isn't - the book is just a little bit better. There are a few plot holes here and there, nothing major though. Pet Sematary "" is an adaptation from the Stephen King novel of the same title.",1
"Soon, they met their new neighbor, and old man named Judd Crandall. It's not THE most horrifying of all, but it is one of the best horror Anyway, he dismisses the dream. There Louis buries the cat on Jud's instruction, with Jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life. Many strange things starts to happen and Church, Ellie's cat, dies while walking on the highway. Louis Creed, a doctor from Chicago, moves to a large house near a small town, since he is going to be giving classes in the University of Maine's.",1
I was not disappointed! !,1
"And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters, who plays this old, secretive man with the right notes of under - playing and doom in tone. And applause goes to whomever did the make - up on Andrew Hubatsek.",1
"Louis buries Church, without Jud's help. It goes along with movie wonderfully. < br / > < br / > 9 / 10 It is at the same time sad and mysterious.",1
"10 out of 10. That character is "" Zelda. "" That burial ground is pure evil. Pet Sematary is about the Creed family. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it is almost perfect.",1
!,1
Recommended for horror fans!,1
"For me nothing compares 2 U, Pia... and I don't suppose I'm only one who's ever felt this way!",1
But its a trashy movie. At least this wasn't boring. Give Pia a break. I want to see someone do that speech in a drama class. < br / > < br / > A couple of the scenes are funny. What's not to like?,1
"What more could you ask for? For laughs, it just doesn't get any better than this.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film is loaded with symbolism. When Jack puts the ring on Mabel's finger, Bobs bracelet slips down her arm. She has left him for Bob - and the fight at the end is a mighty one. Bob is persuaded to go "" one round "" with Jack.",1
"Is he good enough? Tune in and see. Will rise justifiable rage against Bob help or hinder his performance? Later, Jack improves so much that he, too, becomes a legitimate boxer. While far from a perfect silent, it's well worth seeing and packs a nice punch. '",1
But can boxers have such dimples? The camera - work and editing of the last boxing match is very gripping.,1
The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women. Nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols.,1
"So begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman, who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly.",1
"A funny scene to catch is of a rotund man from the audience helping Shashonna out of her pants. Sandra tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of American pop culture to an audience that doesn't completely see it. The scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone. Sandra Bernhard's Without You I'm Nothing, the movie released in 1990, followed on the heels of her 1988 off - Broadway stage production... what she and others refer to in the movie as her "" smash - hit one - woman show. """,1
< br / > < br / > This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest. It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and slender list of worthwhile boxing films.,1
"Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock. The final match, as a result, ends up being somewhat anticlimactic. The only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927.",1
).,1
"At first glance, it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity - themed morality comedies of Cecil B. < br / > < br / > Let's make a few honourable mentions for aforementioned actors. The Ring was made from the only screenplay Hitchcock wrote himself and it deals, as many of his earliest pictures do, with a love triangle. De Mille, but more than that it is the first really competent Hitchcock picture.",1
Wonderful. I have not seen this movie!,1
* sigh * Most recommended.,1
"And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series, and what a treasure they are. < br / > < br / > That was fifty years ago.",1
< br / > < br / > A recommended film which was first for Jim Henson Productions.,1
Not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994. The scenes where the girls are hunted through the woods by the malevolent Sheriff are tense and exciting. But this Shallow Grave is a worthy addition to the 80's backwoods slasher.,1
"For those who love animals, Buddy is a must - see movie. One day, she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla. They dressed in clothes and had many amenities. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control?",1
"The gorilla looks just terrific, and the eyes were especially lifelike. Rene Russo plays her role wonderfully feminine.",1
After Pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife.,1
"And that is what happens. Now, how is he going to get out of it? But what is the meaning of such a film? We also know when he is going to be wounded.",1
"I thought so - to a point where it sent shivers up my spine. Courageous? I remember being shocked at the corrupted system of McNairy County and the brutality of the "" redneck gangs "".",1
"And to all the young people who may have not heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about him. My heart goes out to them. I am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain.",1
< br / > < br / > The animation is decent for 89 but can't compare to nowadays. I actually found it to be somewhat decent. The story is extremely unique. < br / > < br / > The ending COULD have been fantastic.,1
"Considering when it was made, the animation is of superior quality. The seiryuu for Noriko, incidentally, also plays Akane in Ranma 1 / 2. I doubt that scene was meant to be funny, but cracked me up.",1
"This anime is a must - see for fans of Evangelion. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of finest pieces of Anime around.",1
"A couple more characters are introduced, and parts of Noriko's past are dragged up again. < br / > < br / > Luckily, Gainax decided to put it out as a six - part OAV ( direct to video ) series. In short, time moves slower for those who travel at speed of light.",1
The movie's overall tone is truly disturbing. Here's a real weirdo for you.,1
"However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. It is because of her father's death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. I totally loved this series, and to this day, it remains my favorite anime. Aim For The Top! By the end of the series, Noriko is roughly 18 years old while Kimiko is in her mid - fifties.",1
"Adds conviction, I'll say that. Great actor, just coming into his own. Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon do the gambling world proud. He makes love, convincingly as well. WRRROOONNNNGGG!!!",1
"We watch, we return, and we thank them. Why? Better than almost anything you've seen. Yes, some of the dialogue is hokey. The graphics are first rate.",1
"Hidden Frontier has gone where few tread to go in the world of science fiction, and thrived once they got there. The large ensemble cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. Done in a "" Green Screen "" studio ; Hidden Frontiers brings a rollicking cast of regulars on to the screen and into your hearts. I highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch.",1
Congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire. This is short and to the point.,1
Anyway... For a fan series this is good stuff.,1
7 out of 10.,1
I recommend any Trek fan to check out Countermeasures and you will be hooked! The ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting.,1
If u like Star Trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film.,1
"The cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on - screen. It portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way, dealing with them subtly and smoothly. They advice people to see newer episodes first, so they can see just how good the show is, and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes. HF will live for a long time after it ends, as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place. < br / > < br / > The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved.",1
"Do not read if you have not watched series up to this point! As the previous comment stated, I wish I could give it a rating higher than 10, but it will have to suffice.",1
< br / > < br / > Make it so...,1
"Fab to see James Cawley in the latest episode "" Vigil "" Check it out! ( Well, I'm guessing Rene hails from the Czech Rep. ) < br / > < br / > It gets my vote, and the CGI is kewl. < br / > < br / > ( OK, some of the acting isn't great but it's fan - made and is therefore allowed to be variable - sorry Cmm. < br / > < br / > Really glad I found it! Cole ) < br / > < br / > The gay material is layed on too thick ( Graham Norton'd be embarrassed ). Trek doesn't pay that much attention to hetero couples so why signpost gays with all the snogging? ENOUGH already!",1
"For the record, I am not affiliated with the production in any way. < br / > < br / > This is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy. Over 7 seasons ( this is the last ) they have produced some 50 or so episodes.",1
"The production quality is extremely high for a fan film, although sometimes you can tell that they're green - screenin'it. This doesn't take away from the overall experience however.",1
"Hidden Frontier is a fan made show, in the world of Star Trek. The episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes. All in all I enjoyed watching it.",1
"One of Hidden Frontier's greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced. One of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming, instead of in post - production.",1
"I really enjoyed this one, and although the ending made me angry, I still give it 10 out of 10. One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three stay by the car. The girls agree to meet the guys in Florida for some fun, but they have car problems and never make it.",1
"God Bless you all. xx It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. This rates second best to Quadrophenia ( which also starred Phil Daniels ). < br / > < br / > Hazel, sorry to hear about your dad darling. The ending is so sad, for hours after end of the film I am like a blubbering baby.",1
"This was a dazzling time, and Breaking Glass both tells a very personal story and surveys cultural landscape, and does both extremely well.",1
"Please if you get the chance watch this movie you won't be sorry! I first saw "" Breaking Glass "" when it was released in England in 1980..",1
I can't wait for it to be available DVD.,1
This film predates these shows though the effect seems the same. !,1
"< br / > < br / > If you get a chance to, see it. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce's drugged out sax player.",1
"Be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste IS bitter.",1
Very well done though. Peter Egan as the lead Magnus Pym is excellent. He has no real love or loyalty in him. I have just watched the whole 6 episodes on DVD.,1
"The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex, his Czech handler. In later years it is his son who has to bail him out, again and again. < br / > < br / > Never have the machinery behind a spy, and / or traitor, been told better! Everyone's happy, as long as the flow of faked information continues!",1
"Egan plays Pym to perfection as a man always on the run, if not from others then from himself. < br / > < br / > Surronding Egan is a fantastic supporting cast.",1
"< br / > < br / > Another theme is that of malignancy. I like it still. There are a number of themes that these movies share, along with others in the genre. Violence, torture, cruelty are always just beneath the surface. and never, "" Do you love me? "" Throughout the story he betrays and is betrayed. Maybe it says this somewhere else, but A Perfect Spy is a love story.",1
< br / > < br / > I really enjoyed it in the end.,1
< br / > < br / > Jane Booker is annoying as Mary Pym. So much so that I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming. Peter Egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle.,1
"Rent it, buy it. love.",1
"If I had one book to take on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the choice above all others. Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed to perfection.",1
"However, I did enjoy it and I give it... 7 STARS.",1
"Spoilers! Her best scenes were when she was, er, stimulating herself. Whenever she was on screen, I became transfixed.",1
One wishes they made more movies like this one.,1
"Strongly recommended for fans of international cinema. Michael Cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name, including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire The Day the Fish Came Out. Iphigenia, however, is a highlight.",1
!,1
A must see for fans of sexploitation!,1
"7 / 10 Worth a look to exploit fans - others may find it a little too dull for their liking. In order to do so, the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff - and of course drink some blood, too. Some pretty hot women in this one, would have benefited from some more explicit sex, but I guess ya can't have it all.",1
This is an excellent show!,1
But after seeing it I realized what a funny man he is. I would recommend this to anyone interested history and is willing to question what his / her beliefs.,1
"< br / > < br / > I would love to see this picked up as a series for HBO. But it quickly sucked me in. Was it a documentary, was it a comedy routine..... Well, it was BOTH.",1
It is very entertaining.,1
One of the most entertaining examples of pre - code Hollywood out there. Just look at Jane's nude swim.,1
"What a wonderful, wonderful story. I am so glad I stayed on the channel. My name is Eugenia so I thought OK, lets see what this is.",1
"There is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted. But it is everything you could want in movie. This is a great film. The finale, also, is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. She is visually stunning.",1
Jane dominates. Again a pothole. She takes their words for granted and want to be taken away ( to England ). A punishment for being vane perhaps? Stupid? Well. Forever. Some cheap drama. Tarzan himself is co - starring. She could be smart.,1
"108 : Tarzan and His Mate ( 1934 ) - released 4 / 20 / 1934, viewed 8 / 6 / 08. She's totally got him trained. Bonnie & Clyde kill two highway patrolman in Texas. I got a huge kick out of this movie. Just wow. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. Very exciting stuff.",1
"). ), he swings back into action just in time to rescue Jane from a tribe of vicious lion - eating savages who have attacked Holt's expedition. Of course, Tarzan isn't deadonly wounded ; after being nursed back to health by Cheetah (!",1
Its an amazing film by almost any standard. Its an amazing thing.,1
There is NO mistake about that at all.,1
"< br / > < br / > I'm not making this up. So they've not only been having sex, they've been having kinky sex! Once it's explained, he's cool. Jealous? She and Tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter. But when she realizes her man is very much alive, the attractions of civilization vanish for her. Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy. Nope. She stretches sensuously, and with a coquettish look she says "" Tarzan, you've been a bad boy! """,1
WELL worth seeing but not for kids! This wouldn't bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave.,1
He was and is Tarzan.,1
"< br / > < br / > What direction! An act of sacrilege has becalmed the seas, endangering his great expedition to Troy. He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her. It is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant. What camera!",1
"The effect of the lighting, the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual. Tarzan is shot, left for dead ; and the group force Jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous "" elephant's graveyard "". Tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals, in scenes that look like a humanized King King. As Jane Parker, his wife who had been Jane Porter in the novels, Maureen O'Sullivan is very attractive and lively, as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality. But they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions. This is an outdoor adventure filmed on the MGM back - lot which really works.",1
"This to me is very much at the core of the Tarzan experience. Later she admits to Tarzan that she was wrong. Compare, for example, in Tarzan Finds a Son! < br / > < br / > I was really surprised by some quite violent scenes even by today's standards. The crisp display of later Tarzan films is lacking here.",1
"< br / > < br / > Most people consider "" Tarzan and His Mate "" superior to the original "" Tarzan the Ape Man "". The movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him. The characters dare to ask questions like : What if something happened to Tarzan? Tarzan still speaks very broken English, but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate. Naturally, a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way.",1
"When I was a kid it was Lex Barker's time as Tarzan. It wasn't after many years that I came across "" Tarzan and His Mate "", and then I understood. < br / > < br / > Good for Jane and her mate!",1
"Like Tarzan the Ape Man ( 1932 ), only more so. Everybody else dies, Holt and the bad guy and every single one of their "" boys. "" No wonder they're happy. This must be the last Tarzan movie before the Hays Code made Jane wear more clothes. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals.",1
"< br / > < br / > After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality. < br / > < br / > The skin show in this film is off the charts.",1
Not to be missed an adventure classic.,1
"With her pair of "" lungs, "" that was no problem. The nude underwater scene, however, was not her - by a longshot. The only things missing are color and stereo sound. Up to finale, it was not overdone, either.",1
Highly recommended.,1
"I think even Homer, if he really existed, would be proud of this telling.",1
"She did do The release of TARZAN THE APE MAN, in 1932, caused a sensation. Tarzan became an instant pop icon, the'noble savage'that every woman fantasized about, and every man wished he could be.",1
Thank you. Has anyone been able to buy this movie?,1
cartwrightbride @ yahoo.,1
"It's disingenuous and corny in spots, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly, and it deserves to be more widely seen.",1
The waiting for word. The joy of acceptance.,1
"I hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy. This movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a 12 year old kid in 1962 when it was shown on a Los Angeles television station's "" late show "". My memory of it was correct : it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch.",1
"A bit disappointing, but still fun. for one or two weeks. Our food was also first rate = prime rib at lunch, etc. Just short of there we stopped at an army base called either Camp Callan or Camp Hahn.",1
"Despite this, the movie isn't really just an Italian version of the Hollywood movie. They are a very, very far cry from Lana Turner and John Garfield in the Hollywood version. This movie is a ripoff of James Cain's novel, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE. < br / > < br / > The three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people. This is pretty silly and totally unrealistic.",1
It does not have low - key lighting and unconventional camera angles. The numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase. The dialog is not hard - boiled and instead film concentrates more on characterization. This is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization. < br / > < br / > This is The Ruth Snyder - Judd Gray murder in 1927 inspired Ogden Nash to write a Broadway play called Machinal. Its also a lot more sexual than the Lana Turner version. < br / > < br / > Ossessione is not as noirish as The Postman Always Rings Twice.,1
"I almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at Ossessione as it IS a good film, but it's not a'great'film. Still, it makes for an He wants the pair of them to run away together, but she's not so keen on the idea.",1
"The harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters. Finally, Cacoyannis'Iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to Euripides '. Kazakos and Papas embody the sublimity of the classical Greece tragedy. < br / > < br / > The film was shot on location at Aulis.",1
< br / > < br / > A one of kind movie! Four stars ( highest rating ).,1
"All the same, it's incisive and essential, although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.",1
"To say the least it was probably a bit alarming. It relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light. Gino is a drifter ; a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations. I mean, films prior to the neo - realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before.",1
"Oh, those sneaky Italians. < br / > < br / > Nevertheless, I don't really have much else negative to say about this movie. It's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. It's simply a greatly made one, based on some equally great and strong source material. These early drama's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch. Quite an impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to direct some many more great and memorable Italian dramatic movies. The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.",1
"The film is not perfect, though.",1
"Can one build love upon murder? This opinion, however, does not resemble Neorealist movies, in particular this one directed by Count Luchino Visconti.",1
"At last Giovanna feels remorseful about what Giovanna aims at another goal : to get Bragana killed, to inherit and, in addition to that, to collect insurance premium. The very taking over of Bragana's place, which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man, causes a deep loathing of himself. Being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold - blooded killer. In her hands Gino degenerates into a self - sacrificing tool. < br / > < br / > But in contrast to Giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level.",1
That's not what this is about.,1
who can forget.... !,1
"Excellent direction, script, acting, and cinematography. Unusual ending in which, although crime does not pay, one pays in a way not directly linked to crime. Highly recommended.",1
Cacoyannis achieved the impossible. ! A stellar greek cast helps him in this.,1
"Neo - realism, by the way, could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather ( along with De Sica's The Children Are Watching Us ), which that would take shape after the war. Although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neo - realist efforts, it's dealt with in a bare - bones storytelling fashion, and it's laced with other familiar themes in neo - realism ( the lower - class, death, desperation ). I didn't know what to expect Visconti to do in his approach to the material, after seeing La Terra Trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit. I think I've just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along, even as I was in fear of the futures of the two leads.",1
Sometime next year it should be available on DVD and hopefully also released on HD DVD. After this rest is manual labor and we don't anticipate finishing before early spring.,1
"This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. My vote is ten. They both decide to kill Giuseppe, forging a car accident.",1
"Wow! American audiences didn't see its full glory till 59, eight years AFTER Streetcar. The most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema! Yes, i'm being superlative, but Ossessione was just that terrific.",1
< br / > < br / > The film has been well preserved in the DVD format we watched recently. Luchino Visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries. Giovanna is one of the best creations in Ms. Calamai's achievements in the Italian cinema.,1
"Well, no matter what is left is a fine piece of cinema, apparently the forerunner of the neo - realist movement in film - making. They immediately start a heated, passionate, yet volatile love affair.",1
Gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea. Their relationship quickly crumbles. The two novellas seem like they must be very similar.,1
"This film is a complex, suspenseful, rewarding experience.",1
Shot in Fascist Italy during World War II ( think about it!!,1
This is a really fun movie. Don't expect Oscar quality.,1
Well when watching this film late one night I was simple amazed by it's greatness.,1
""". However, this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script. When I started watching the show I said "" Oh, no!",1
"It was fantastic. Good job, Type - MOON! This anime seriously rocked my socks.",1
"Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city. The pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on. < br / > < br / > You mustn't compare this series with any other to fully understand it's plot. I was at a lost for words "". Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by a h - game.",1
"< br / > < br / > Also, even though this was based on H - game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and I actually prefer it this way. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story, well built characters ( some mysterious ) and a bit of fantasy action. I have to agree with everyone else that has posted.",1
"When I got the first volume of this show, it was the best. I had to see this show, and that is what I really did. He does have cool character.",1
It also has some great Japanese music in it too! < br / > < br / > I give this series a 10 / 10.,1

Krisana is in the same mould.,1
Great characters and great lines. !,1
"He has to make things right. He pieces more and more of her life together. His "" look "" changes as his obsession grows. A good Indie ending. Footsteps.",1
"That's the plot in a nutshell, but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act. If you are more concerned with plot, this film and its ending may frustrate you. The filmmakers undoubtedly had little money, but this constraint is used to the film's advantage.",1
I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies. Also - a really cool zombie twist which I thought was VERY ORIGINAL. As a child of divorced parents I was totally relating to events in the film.,1
"Anyway, what can I say, I love this film. Just kidding about the weight loss thing ; well, you might lose weight you never know.",1
< br / > < br / > I found film to be delightful!,1
"Even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to Pan's Labyrinth. At the screening I saw, I swear there was one moment where entire audience screamed. I highly recommend catching this film.",1
"< br / > < br / > The whole, this time, is much better than sum of its parts. This is NOT a horror flick. Young Anthony de Marco, as Jake, puts in a particularly good performance.",1
< br / > < br / > A definite see!,1
I really felt for Jake.,1
Or could the creature be real? Jake's Closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of Hell.,1
"Oscar exclamation. You like me! """,1
Jake is so convinced that one is out to get him and his family he begins to hatch a plan of action to protect them before it's too late. Magrath also has a tough task to make her manipulative character relatively likable but she proves to in a revealing scene that I won't go into detail but shows why she is the way she is ( and more importantly how she has also affected her own child ).,1

This is why I still have nightmares.,1
This movie is not limited to children either. And keep Jack Wild's memory alive by passing Pufnstuff on to others. The music in this movie suited Jack Wild and Mama Cass beautifully. Let's all go to Living Island where there is friendship and fun!,1
I cried every time I watched it. I loved Jack Wilde. ). I totally identified with the characters. I can still remember characters vividly. Pufnstuf rocks!!!! It wasn't weird to me.,1
I highly recommend it.,1
I'd recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose. Otherwise it would be a perfect 10.,1
Excellent film.,1
"The acting by the whole cast is also superb, especially that of the two leads, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. This is a fascinating account of the hunt for the Soviet Union's first known serial killer.",1

"The locations and sets are perfect recreations of latter day Soviet life. < br / > < br / > The cast is outstanding. He discovers past and present unsolved murders, apparently by the same person. His naiveté would have led to failure were it not for his boss, Col. Mikhail Fetisov ( Donald Sutherland ). He is driven to find and stop the killer. "" His only tools are his dedication, skill and honesty.",1
"That could have been so much better, this movie deserves it.",1
Jeffrey DeMunn as the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. It debuted I believe on HBO and never did get a theatrical release to my understanding.,1
"The movie did a great job at giving you some insight, perhaps even very realistic, into the culture of daytime soap.",1
Good directing.,1
Stephen Rea's depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving. His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable.,1
A masterpiece of genre. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with the direction and the screenplay.,1
Rent or buy this movie today! The catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on edge of my seat. The devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by Rea.,1
"Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn, and von Sydow ( in a small role ) are all brilliant in their performances. < br / > < br / > This is sad, but very important film, which deserved its showcase on Canada's History Television. You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who labored in that system.",1
"Quibbles about truth and veracity aside, all of these events are dramatized in a manner that consistently tightens the tension and fear. Yes, Chikatilo raped and murdered both children and adults, both male and female. Yes, shoddy lab - work set him free to continue killing for years. < br / > < br / > It doesn't hurt that director and co - writer Chris Gerolmo has a pitch perfect cast. It is easy to follow and has just enough truth behind its version of events to make for compelling viewing.",1
"Excellent script. However, they have a common cause to catch the serial killer. These are at first polarised, with Sutherland'high'in system looking down, and Rea'low'on the ground, looking up.",1
"He followed case to its conclusion, 3 years later. Rea does so much with his face, his eyes, he doesn't need to overact. The story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov played to perfection by Stephen Rea. Upon seeing it again, I'm always reminded of how good it is.",1
Congrats to the director editor of this great piece. It is in my Top 10 Must see list.,1
At the end of the contest countries vote to see what the best song was. It's obvious within the first 10 minutes of CITIZEN X whodunnit.,1
"< br / > < br / > I adore this movie, and so does everyone I work with - - and that is the point. I spent a large part of my working life in cinema, without being an actor. But hardly anyone has done it so well.",1
< br / > < br / > This is a quality film. Brilliant. The subject matter is at once grim and gripping.,1
"In fact, he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him, until we remember what he is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement.",1
"Jeffrey DeMunn is downright scary as the killer. < br / > < br / > Rea is outstanding as the determined, harried - looked detective. Don't pass this by just because you haven't anything about it. There are only two short action scenes but they are horrific.",1
"He is the objective. This is one damn fine film. Well, too bad.",1
"Not overly done either. The settings are beautiful. I recommend it for anyone interested in Russian history, too.",1
"He is tortured, ashamed, but vicious as well. HBO has hit the jackpot here. This film is compelling from the first moment until the last.",1
"It deserves at least a 9 / 10, perhaps even more if you ask me. He is tortured, ashamed, as well as extremely vicious.",1
"Wow! What a brilliant film. There is no way to spoil the ending ; who the killer is is never kept from the audience. The general in charge ( Joss Ackland ) says that serial killers are "" a decadent, Western phenomenon "". Only Donald Sutherland is willing to help, but his help must be under counter. Why wasn't it released to a wider audience? By committing these horrendous acts, he gets to feel strong, powerful. This was fascinating, albeit morbid, reading.",1
"Of course, no one wants to go near the castle. Baron Dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay. At the beginning of the film, yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilated.",1
"TV Soap Actors. Great. Those eyes! Like a silent movie star, but better.",1
I really loved Georges [UNK]'s voice work in this one. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take or leave.,1
No wonder the sequence ended'That's Entertainment'after all other MGM musical highlights had gone by!,1
"The words don't fit the plot, but the routines fit the show. What's important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film. < br / > < br / > And what better director for this project than Minnelli, himself a painter and a pianist? It wasn't because Hollywood was against art or creativity. What makes for Best Picture material?",1
"Or at least, not very well worked out. < br / > < br / > A 7.",1
"The movie could had also definitely been done with a few less musical numbers in it. Not that it makes the movie drag in any parts, it just makes it a bit overlong.",1
"The film was inspired by the 1928 orchestral composition by George Gershwin. Gene Kelly directed brief fantasy dance sequences shown as Lise is introduced. An American In Paris is an integrated musical, meaning that the songs and dances blend perfectly with the story. When she got the call to audition, she said, "" Who's Gene Kelly? """,1
"Very good! Filled with nice romance and wonderful song and dance, this is a very good musical film.",1
"< br / > < br / > Gene's hoofer's voice is serviceable here but Guétary has much the better vocal equipment. and I don't imagine his casting was ever in doubt. A talented dancer, she was never a real beauty. < br / > < br / > I also found Nina Foch's character Milo to be rather irritating.",1
"... Oxford, Mississippi, at least.",1
"Musn't forget the beiges as well. I'm sorry, Leslie Caron bothers me. One thing's missing, and that thing is a good leading lady. The story and music ( George Gershwin! )",1
"Some purely majestic, others pure corn. He is definately one of the all time greats. < br / > < br / > Some have said that Leslie Caron's acting was less than pure. Ingenious!",1
"Uggh! In fact, I consider this one of the most overrated films of the 50s.",1
"8 / 10 Famous French singer Georges Guietary sings, too. Meanwhile Gene Kelly falls for lovely damsel, Leslie Caron. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli.",1
"ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!",1
A must see! But they never did quite make them like this.,1
The choreography was great. He is so talented. I enjoyed this film. It is enchanting.,1
"Worth the watch! And Leslie Caron can't really, um, you know... act. It's stunningly filmed, and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. < br / > < br / > Not on'classics'level with'Singin'In The Rain ', but pretty high up there nonetheless.",1
"This is soooo funny!! ). And it has quite a bit of satire there to. Sadly Elisabeth Shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part. There are few comedies like this, where almost every line and every character come close to flawless. Sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top, but 90 % of the time she is a riot!",1
"Even he knows it, though Milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes her. "". You want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies.",1
"The two films are actually closely linked. < br / > < br / > The film's cast is uniformly excellent. An American in Paris was, in many ways, the ultimate mixture of art and Hollywood musical.",1
"But see! If you love Paris, see this movie.",1
Gene Kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with MGM. < br / > < br / > Two women are interested in him. Not one note of non - Gershwin music is heard in An American in Paris. Caron also has musical comedy star Georges Guetary interested in here.,1
He expresses all his emotions with'Our Love Is Here to Stay.,1
"Parsifal journeys into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film. Syberberg is known for controversial films. The tempting Flower Maidens are in the nude. Reiner Goldberg's Parsifal is a focused and intense voice but it lacks the depth and overall great The Swaztika flag hangs outside the fortress. In the pagan sorcerer Klingsor's fortress, there are photographs of such notoriously sinister figures as Hitler, Nietzche, Cosima Wagner and Wagner's mistress Matilde Wesendock. Kundry is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt Mary Magdalene or Eve from Genesis ( played by Edith Clever but beautifully sung by mezzo - soprano Yvonne Minton ). Indeed, the singing is grand and compelling.",1
"( See footnote with spoiler at the end of this review. ) < br / > < br / > Personally, I never really understood the role of Kundry until I saw how Edith Clever portrayed her. This very peculiar setting of Wagner's last opera definitely grew on me. When I first saw it, I was somewhat annoyed by many of the films surrealistic images, and felt that far too much was superimposed upon the story.",1

"< br / > < br / > Well worth seeing and exciting - - though also quite impossible. This is quite an impressive cast, and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. I've already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air. ! Etienne Girardot is just a character actor - - the sort of person people almost never would know by name. Used car salesmen and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious targets! While the mystery itself is rarely that terrific, because of the breezy writing and acting, the films really satisfy. However, he once again plays the coroner - - one of the only actors in the Philo Vance films that played his role more than once.",1
Exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes.,1
I have been a fan of this movie for years and years. Sally Field and Kevin Kline are beyond fabulous. The acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart.,1
"Must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film. < br / > < br / > Douglas Walton plays the unlucky jockey who appears to be intent on his own demise ( hypnotism, anyone? < br / > < br / > Nicely done and passes time in an entertaining manner.",1
"But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance films. S. S. Van Dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with Hollywood. < br / > < br / > I will say this though. Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.",1
"A warm family film to enjoy. Never mind, each of them are good in their own way. < br / > < br / > I do admire Joan Plowright even if her role is somewhat subdued here.",1

"The final few scenes are powerful but depressing. However, the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient.",1
It's not just an impression - - things do happen in the movie - - but the plot is understated.,1
"It was, if nothing else, not a predictable film. None of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place. However, not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it.",1

I was also struck with the love / hate relationship between him and Aimee. < br / > < br / > One never is sure what motivates everyone, though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism. He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother. It is this cynical side of the story that ties it to Coup de Torchon.",1

There!,1
My 3rd - year French classes always enjoyed this film very much.,1
"The heart of the film, however, revolves around France's mother Aimée ( Giulia Boschi ) and her love / hate relationship with Protée that is seething with unspoken sexual tension. The film is told from the perspective of an adult returning to her childhood home in a foreign country. < br / > < br / > The household is divided into public and private spaces.",1

Wonderful.,1
This movie is probably for you.,1
"). This stellar film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy, who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials ( wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc. )",1
this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction. it has no boundaries as far as age goes.,1
"< br / > < br / > The story? So, if you like satire, I'd recommend you see it. Way back in 1955, the British made a comedy called Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and the brilliant Kay Kendall. Are you confused? That is, if actors ever do have a real life? In fact, it's been a while since I laughed so heartily.",1
"Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works don't really last, except as photos or films of what they were. His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field.",1
"Before long this delicate sculpture melts away to nothing in the brilliant Nova Scotian sunlight. Working with his teeth and bare hands, Goldsworthy crafts a beautiful, ephemeral work.",1
"The music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating. What I got was something completely satisfying, and quite a bit more than I expected. I for one am glad to know that Andy is somewhere out there.",1
"But do go if you have the opportunity. He makes art from objects he finds in nature. The work seems to be more of a process than a goal. We're born, we live, and eventually we die. That's natural, and that's also naturally a part of Goldsworthy's art.",1
"And always with the utmost respect, gratitude and humor of a wandering, and wondering monk. Indeed, time and change is what his work is fundamentally about.",1
"That is his theme. < br / > < br / > Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy's work is in this sort of expression. The idea was, that by emphasizing how short - lived are even the mightiest works of humans, a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed. < br / > < br / > At another point he remarks on "" What is here to stay... and what isn't. """,1

Cal expressed it well. Drama is everywhere and it can take every shape. High schools have became battle fields of conformity. I understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror. Thing is... < br / > < br / > The real motive of the movie isn't about what is driving them.,1

"You either love it or you hate it, and not everyone will like this movie. < br / > < br / > The actual massacre is shown through surveillance cameras at school and is one of the most chilling things I have ever seen. It is very realistic and well - done, and it is very difficult to watch. As always, controversial movies like this have mixed reviews. Our feelings towards the boys are something mixed between sympathy and hatred, but yet we are left confused as to why two ordinary young boys would do such a thing. Zero Day does not offer answers, but merely presents a glimpse at the lives of two troubled young boys and lets the audience decide for themselves.",1
"< br / > < br / > Zero Day is a phenomenal film. A week after seeing this film, I still think about it. Probably. It leaves you thinking about lives involved. This is not mainstream Hollywood and there is no happy ending. The material in the film is disturbing.",1

"imdb. Much better then other flight movie Flight Plan. < br / > < br / > The pacing in this film was great. Not too long and not too shabby. Intense acting, great villain and unexpected action.",1
Red Eye starts in Texas where hotel receptionist Lisa Reisert ( Rachel McAdams ) is about to catch the last'red eye'flight back to Miami where she lives & works.,1
Greetings again from the darkness. Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane. What a relief... a thriller that actually is thrilling! She is a natural.,1
Cillian's icy but eloquent Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams resourceful Lisa are the main reasons the film gets carried off. < br / > < br / > Short haul fun. < br / > < br / > In the final portion of the film Craven indulges himself a little Scream style as man - chases - girl - with - knife.,1
It steadily built suspense. The F / X were great. Go see it!,1
"Red Eye really shows his skills at storytelling. You may even end up cheering for her out loud. Wes Craven does a really good job behind the camera. Overall, the tone of the film is consistently creepy. Also, the ending is disappointing.",1
"as I'm not sure it makes a great deal of sense. But that didn't bother me, as I enjoyed watching it unfold. Just sit back and enjoy.",1
"No special effects. Just classic suspense. No cheap make up. It's either her sweet face or her uncanny ability to sincerely cry, but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it. What she doesn't know is he already knows her. < br Scream was Wes Craven's last decent thriller.",1
Good job! Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. I had fun watching Red Eye.,1
Go see it. Enjoy! The trailer does not do movie justice. I felt satisfied. The suspense is held through out the movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > Some rough edges in this picture, but I have to give it 7 out of 10 stars based on its thoughtfulness and yes, originality as compared to the usual - - especially on a budget. This movie was released by Roger Corman, so you know that the filmmakers didn't have much money to work with. < br / > < br / > AMANDA, as played by the obviously talented Justine Priestley, is a complex character.",1
< br / > < br / > The directing is surprising stylish. Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. Cillian Murphy is creepier than he was in Batman Begins.,1
"Understandably, he is soon asked to leave. < br / > < br / > At any rate, I was confused about how the show was put together, since it shows Brad at the height of his addiction. I have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart - breaking than his drug addiction. We see footage of him pan - handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine.",1
"Not so : addictions are about killing pain. I'm a middle - aged married father of two. She strips for cash for a 75 - year old neighbor and lets men abuse her. ' Sound familiar to anyone? Many addicts have suffered miserable abuse. Some kids simply respond badly to divorce. There are common themes, and surprising exceptions. The show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started.",1
"I find I enjoy this show, but the format needs some work. This makes the positive outcomes all the better. By now you may have forgotten which case the individual currently on screen belong to. Get caught up in that story then suddenly you're back to the first addict... or are you? < br / > < br / > Now for the bad. First off, the good attributes. Oh please. This is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome. It's actually superior to scripted shows like "" The Shield "" where the photography is so bad it can induce nausea.",1
This show is awesome!,1
Or it is like The Brave One. It is a crude portrait of the city. Leaves you shaking and stunned. Of a Metropolis.,1
"A bitter reflexion about the biggest trouble in this country ( and many others ). < br / > < br / > 4. A surprisingly good cast. They say that in Mexico people laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example. Four good stories, related into a big scheme. Four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary Mexican cinema. And by the way, give us the scene that steals the movie with Anna Ciochetti making a brief striptease.",1
"The recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply. Is that what we all are? I nearly puked when I saw some of the images. < br / > < br / > The movie is deeper than some "" cabrón "" and "" pendejo "" screams.",1
I saw this movie when it first came out.,1
Its a must watch movie. Dont miss it!,1
"Now, in conclusion, I recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it. It's kind of hard to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative about things.",1
Lexi's parents have just split up. Lexi is admitted to hospital.,1
"It gets into the minds of people with eating disorders, and shows the complications and pain, in a very realistic way, and I loved that. I thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told, and defiantly one of my favourite.",1
This film shows it as it is.,1
There should be more movies like this.,1
"A newcomer to Kells, Brother Aiden, inspires Brendan to take up illustrating. This film is not in black and white. Oh no.",1
Even what I've explained doesn't do this film justice. People die. Much to his uncle's chagrin Aiden offers to teach Brendon how to illuminate. Its a simple story with so much more going on. Its not sugar coated. Frankly the darkness in this film is completely unlike anything in any recent American film.,1
"To do that task, in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling. And the comic relief is sometimes bit too broad.",1
I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for Amanda's plight this aspect of the story elicits. < br / > < br / > The cast is excellent I think.,1
"< br / > < br / > The films true beauty lies in its'animation. For all genders, all ages, it's a lovely piece of family cinema. < br / > < br / > The Secret of Kels is an absolute treat. In hopes of recovering a lost artefact.",1
"There were so many shapes, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the movie mid - way and smash my burned copy of this movie. Brendan lives in the village of Kells behind huge stone walls. This book will contain information that will help "" change darkness into light. "" I figured I was just missing a piece of Irish history. It felt like a slight acid trip.",1
< br / > < br / > See my full review of The Secret of Kells at : http : / /oscarsblog. com / 2010 / 02 / movie - review - secret - of - kells.,1
"< br / > < br / > I like the story a lot more now that I know what it is about. This is one of them. Aidan has special plans for Brendan. There are things worse than Vikings out there. First he needs ink for the book, but he requires specific berries.",1
"THE SECRET OF KELLS is an astonishing first animated feature which will dazzle your eye and move your heart. Historically this was in the late 8th century, when the centers of Irish learning were over - run by the Vikings. Of course, historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor This is the movie's outer conflict. The characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original Book of Kells. The Abbot disregards the value of Brendan's art in his quest for security. Brendan's inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative illumination which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the Book of Kells. < br / > < br / > What I really like about this film is its creators'imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the West from 1200 years ago.",1
"The sparse Celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film. < br / > < br / > Try to catch this quiet gem of a film. OK, the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting. One day, Aiden, the renowned illustrator from Iona, sought refuge with them. I would have liked to know more about the Book that Brendan and Aiden was working on. The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting.",1
The groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal. THE SECRET OF KELLS may be the most exquisite film I have seen since THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE.,1
"The story is well realised, a mix of fact and fantasy. and really draws the viewer in to cheer on Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the Book. May there be many more. The cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as I'd feared. I'm here to tell you now it's been worth the wait. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place.",1
A solid and satisfying winner.,1
"And there's some actual comedy from the ripping chemistry between the two leads. Lively action and spectacular stunts - for their day - give this movie some real zip. You might be able to forgive that because of the time in which it was made, but it's still hard to get past. Quinn makes a good villain also, although his role is completely overshadowed.",1
"Against All Flags "" is every bit the classic swashbuckler.",1
"). < br / > < br / > Anthony Quinn is the mean, bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer. Excellent pirate entertainment!",1
I thought Charley came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth. I love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music.,1
The ending was great and I was very happy to see at least one of the team make it.,1
"I always follow the Dakar, so when my husband bought Charlie's'Race to Dakar'DVD home I couldn't wait to watch it! Charlie and Ewan are planning another of these epos called the Long Way Down in 2007, and I can't wait to get my hands on it! < br / > < br / > What I learned from this odyssey was - 1. never let Scorpion prepare your vehicle for ANYTHING!",1
"Great stuff! It is educational, funny, interesting and tense. uk and watch it on your computer as I did. Yikes.",1
As for their being no mention of it on the package. They should have given it a 15 just for language alone. Great to see him with Ewan again. !,1
< br / > < br / > Wonderful location shooting Hawaii.,1
"if you like clara, i would reccomend "" hula. """,1
"The photography and the compositions are excellent. Only at the last minute does our protagonist let his guard down and so the contrived morality of an eye for an eye remains intact. Ostensibly, "" Big Guns "" is a rather bloodless outing, but it does have a high body count for a 1973 mobster melodrama. Tessari does not waste a second in this 90 - minute shoot'em up.",1
< br / > < br / > Note : the IMDb credit list is wrong. Bow settles her hash fast. The predatory wife is ready for a divorce until she discovers he might be on the verge of a fortune.,1
"Clara's lack of modesty was shocking in the day, but I believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie.",1
"Maybe to a place like Willoughby, but that's another episode. Popping in a CD has it's advantages.",1
"and decent enough set - design. Ironically, I felt Lupino was unconvincing throughout, with only a few scenes that could count as memorable. This of course being an absolute shame considering how well Sterling had written her character. I really enjoyed this episode, which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired.",1
"Except in the Twilight Zone. It is somewhat surprising, then, that she is rewarded with a happy ending. It's a situation most can sympathise with, and yet Trent is far from a sympathetic character.",1
He doesn't realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before.,1
Loved it.,1
!,1
"Go see it because it is a good movie! This was that in going into this film I didn't realise that it was actually a remake of "" Heaven Can Wait "" another quite good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. Previous to going to see this movie I wasn't that over the top about him but now I'm banging on the doors of Chris Rock's website begging him to take me on as his protege. Don't read plot!",1
"It comes from Delon's rather short flirting with the Italian B cinema of the'70s. Needless to mention that these two films, Tony Arzenta ( 1973 ) and Zorro, are very unlike. < br / > < br / > "" Arzenta "" is interestingly filmedan ambitious visual conception, some Expressionistic peculiar angles.",1
This movie i have been dying to see. It was completely worth it.,1
Great movie when I saw it.,1
He has some good stand - up this movie. but I saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy.,1
This one is not so great. It all seems real fake and the editing is just bad.,1
"He's hit by a truck. His jokes are lame, his delivery painful. So what to do? What luck! You can imagine how Lance will turn things around.",1
"But I guess title already kind of gives that away. This is a love story, not Saw 3. ! < br / > < br / > xxx Enjoy! < br / > < br / > It's story was so original and charming.. I really have no idea where that came from, they must be discussing a different film then. Even more so, I adored him. This is such a great film! Never mind the low rating here.",1
"This movie, and its sequel "" Distant Thunder, "" are must see movies.",1
I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very moving. God will bless you if that is why you are watching them.,1
I think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it. She is a pretty good actress.,1
"People also met their dooms in creative and bloody fashion, for instance in a junkyard cruncher. Also cheesy, of course, and sporadically very cheesy. But beyond the cheese, the overall atmosphere was affecting and expertly pulled off. It's sad there's no Gloria Grahame but so fantastic that it's Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Yet he's totally tough and icy cool.",1
"Everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic! And "" news "" are : Marvellous labyrinthine spectacle! < br / > < br / > Bravo!",1
"The movie is just based on biblical facts. com, and judge for yourself. Blessings to all.",1
Of course I am speaking as a gen xer. The Vietnam war was just over. Just think... back then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from.,1
No one can ever blame themselves because they're always right. They just needed to find an excuse and blamed A Thief In The Night. These people must be full grown adults. Do not listen!,1
If you can see this movie. ! This is a great movie.,1
"So, the movie - maker uses both action and dialog to tell his story. < br / > < br / > The message of the movie is superb. The only cure is blood from someone who is immune to the snake - poison. The answer to all these questions is an unqualified "" yes. "" ( 2 ) The filmmaker also develops the message of salvation through dialog. Is the story compelling?",1
"BUT. So It was made in 1972, so what. ( for fear ofpoiling it ) So go out and see this film! The fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time.",1
I would like to have an update.,1
Of course non believers will say its only a sci - fi movie. ! That means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it. The reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did!,1
"This is a movie you shouldn't not only see, but feel with your heart soul.",1
< br / > < br / > / 10 Overall a good episode. Only this time... with the homeless.,1
"What used to terrify me in junior high now makes me laugh. I hate to admit it, but I still thoroughly enjoy watching this. The intriguing adventures of Patty and her journey throughout the tribulation ( and two of the film's three sequels ) tells her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation. I think I'm only person in history to make that observation.",1
"Bocka The issue is how Ms Duke had an illness and fought to survive it and overcame. I saw myself acting out just like her. It was so real... so, so, real. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie. That is not the issue here.",1
Any one know how to get it?,1
"It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers that is what helps people most. But, in her case, what she did was remarkable. I always thought she was great and always will. Thank you Ms. Duke, or Anna, which ever you prefer. She has been through a lot and has faced it.",1
"Then you must see this film, to understand the reality. As she was growing up in the 1950's, the stigma was in full - force. She was a household name in America by age 15. However, we see as she advances in her career, yet the illness becomes worse.",1
"This film however, is very amusing.",1
"< br / > < br / > The plot is flyweight. Will Elvira best her evil uncle and save the day? Recommended. And if you've never seen tassle - twirling, you're in for a treat.",1
"Screenplay Sam Egan, John Paragon. Her agent Manny proves a disappointment.",1
"Yet. In all, a good, intentionally campy, comedy. If you like this kind of thing, that is. See, Elvira actually is a real witch, she just doesn't know it.",1
Keeping his true vision for his zombie epics fully intact! I found this episode to be one of funniest I've seen in a long time.,1
"< br / > < br / > Just don't expect too much. Well she is. She's also an incredible pair of legs. Apart from the obvious reasons. Sadly it's a wasted opportunity. Sure, it's a one joke film but it's a funny gag.",1
"In the end, however, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. Elvira : I haven't had any complaints. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. The magnetism radiated from Elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality.",1
It had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a late night cable talk show host style.,1
"Was it really that forgettable, or should I give it another watch? Out to claim her rightfully inherited money, she I actually really do feel like re - watching it now, as this first Elvira film from'88 really convinced me. One thing had been clear to me already long before this music video : Over the years, Elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid - 80's came around.",1
"But to her horror, elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her is her house, her dog and a cookbook.",1
when my sister said this movie was gonna be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny.,1
"Matt and Trey played it safe this week, and didn't really critique homeless problem, just lampooned it. < br / > < br / > Now we must wait until October for the next batch of episodes. < br / > < br / > Night of the Living Homeless is a spoof of the zombie genre, done in a way only South Park would think of. Instead of flesh eating zombies, the entities are homeless that request change and seem to survive off of it. The ending is somewhat funny, but nothing new. Another inspired South Park moment.",1
You can don'thing but marvel at her acting prowess! What can one say about Elvira that hasn't already been said in the world's press?,1
You can rely on me. This is cool and classical movie!,1
"Then there is the "" tassle "" scene. < br / > < br / > One point of contention - the ending. One more rewrite for the ending was needed. < br / > < br / > Comedy is hard - much harder than any drama.",1
This movie is sure to delight any fan of Elvira's. ( screams in background ) Whoa!,1
"There's no place like home, there's no place like home! "" There is a show down with her uncle ( the wicked witch of the West ) where Elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him.",1
"In the end Elvira's dreams finally come true, which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman. Meanwhile, I wish you'' unpleasant dreams!'' This film is pure Elvira and shows her at her breast... I mean best!",1
"I mean the thing with two heads "" ). Deserves a peek ( The film, not her boobs, of course ). < br / > < br / > Unfortunately, the place she has to go is the town of Fallwell, Massachusetts. Seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock.",1
"Few men could disagree with that. < br / > < br / > Elvira's character is the focus here. OK, this movie is stupid. There is a pretty weak plot, but it works just fine. She is lovable and adorable.",1
"He has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from Elvira. In this movie, her charms are put to good use. < br / > < br / > my thoughts : I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter - ego Elvira. < br / > < br / > I loved the whole'fish out of water'feel to the film.",1
"Elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town's old charge of witchcraft, and the showdown between her and her uncle. The plot is pretty simple, but the humor and well developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace. "" Only the local hunk ( Daniel Greene ), and a group of teenagers will befriend her. with touches of the supernatural. Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark "" is a sort of "" Harper Valley P. T. A. "" The adults of the small and narrow minded town make things worse by making things more difficult for Elvira. Elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to get his hands on it knowing of its power.",1
"More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park, until the town is completely overrun with them. Night of the Living Homeless "" was a fairly strong finish to the first half of Season 11. Then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for change. Randy immediately turns on him, holding the gun to the man's head.",1
I always loved Elvira's TV show when I lived in LA. There are never enough. Watch this movie & forget your troubles. He exudes a wonderful refined malice. What it will do is entertain.,1
Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout. He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was an irreverent pupil. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints.,1
"I'm not sure that cathedrals have that impact on everyone, but this movie certainly had that impact on me. It was awesome! Over the course of the movie, his story slowly comes out and becomes the focal point of the story. If you've ever been on a high school field trip to anywhere this is basically it. - which is, in fact ( in my opinion ) what often passes for religious tolerance in our society. YAWN! That's a good question, "" he replied. "" But it turns out to be so much more!",1
"The climax was very satisfying, if rather simplistic. Congratulations! The acting was excellent and Timothy Spall was once again superb.",1
Celia Imrie puts more warmth into supervisor's role than the martinets she usually has to play.,1
if you have a chance of seeing this film do see it.,1
"So many of the characters were so real. Amazing acting, music.",1
A fine effort for an Australian show. no.,1
Here's to hoping for another season! Tripping Over.,1
Episode one was excellent!,1
What more could you want?,1
"Beirut ""... "" What do you know about Beirut? Saw this in the theater in'86 and fell out of my chair laughing more than once. """,1

Taft is drawing plays in the mud, with sticks, stones, and bottle caps, what a riot! < br / > < br / > Holly Palance and Pamela Reed give memorable performances as wives of Williams and Russell.",1
is from the 1950s and very early 1960s. That means that the protagonists graduated in 1972.,1
< br / > < br / > I saw it in a sneak preview. Cleaned up here as not to offend anyone. The film did not do well at the box office.,1
A great reverse tragedy.,1
"Benoit put Spike through a table moments later to even the score. Bubba slammed Guerrero and Spike stomped on Wolverine from off the top rope. With Benoit stomping away on Bubba, Guerrero set up a table outside. headbutt! Bubba held Benoit at bay for Spike to soar into the Wassup!",1
"Not easy when his Father - in - law ( Donald Moffat ) habitually reminds him of the biggest drop. I believe many of us have had that moment in our lives. This is the premise of the movie, "" The Best of Times. """,1
But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty good comedy team. Check it out. I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point.,1
"Beirut ""... "" What do you know about Beirut? Saw this in the theater in'86 and fell out of my chair laughing more than once. """,1
This movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns.,1
"Pure fun! Explosions, shootouts, bad guys and worse guys. It is a whole lot better than all the direct to DVD garbage that is made nowadays. But boy, did I have fun watching this movie. This movie has everything you want from an action movie. But more about the journey to that moment.",1
8 out of 10,1
This movie surprised me in a good way.,1
"But the Mafia tracks him down, and wants 12 Million Dollar.",1
"the other brit it was a bit shocking, but overal it was a laugh.",1
Some twists and many action scenes. The movie was made for me!,1
"< br / > < br / > * Leporids are rabbits and hares. < br / > < br / > Anyway, this is a great one.",1
"Animals like say, a certain rabbit. It still remains as funny nearly 60 + years later.",1
"Naturally, Bugs objects and the fun begins. Is it a good idea to use live animals for department store window displays?",1
The latter - day Bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking.,1
"Chuck Jones's'Hare Conditioned'is a fast paced, often hilarious cartoon.",1
I enjoyed it a lot. Please read the book as is it a great source of information. Please don't ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness.,1
"Like a lot of academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. Sure. < br / > < br / > Is Diamond a little preachy?",1
The ending was quick though. < br / > < br / > 4. WWE Not too many holds and just pure raw physicallity. Additionally there is a good music video.,1
High recommended viewing. I will also be seeking out the book that was the source material for this documentary.,1
"A definite recommendation. Indeed, it does. They say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school.",1
"They cannot have watched the same series that * I * did. Neither did I see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things. < br / > < br / > So, I don't see what some of the other commentators are complaining about.",1
It actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner!! ! Rock Star : INXS was the best music TV series I have ever watched!,1
"Don't know who they are? The common denominator here is the awesome House Band. < br / > < br / > Remember the "" strings "" night? Get those boys a good lead singer and they are going places.",1
This is almost typical Lynch. They were inspired.,1
"First of all, I find this short - film very entertaining and interesting. And in good right.",1
"Zooms also go back and forth sometimes. This can be felt even in this crappy room. < br / > < br / > Even as simple film, this creation is multy - layer. There is diagonal pan.",1
John Cena had an excellent match in which he upset Chris Jericho. Overall this is probably WWE's 2nd best PPV of 2002!,1
This is your typical Lynch short.,1
This episode highlighted the psychological ordeal of Will Riker under extreme duress.,1
"I am attempting to watch all things Star Trek. The Data and Riker scene in the holo - deck is a classic moment of new friendship. Season 1 always seemed real dark and ugly to me - and the actors looked silly, like they didn't fit in their own skins. Then the admiral kicks his a $ $ but good. < br / > < br / > Here is the article : http : / / memory - alpha.",1
"It is available in several places on the internet. This is quite the gripping, fascinating, tragic story.",1
It just seems so tragic but needs to be told. Jim Jones from obscurity until total madness. It is the kind of mini - series you won't forget.,1
But the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of the Rev.,1
!,1
The last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable - and I mean it! Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal. A well cast summary of a real event!,1
"The tragic passing of Ruth affects Will deeply. Many people know how it feels when a loved one is lost. She gently pets Tulip, caressing her ears and patting her back.",1
"The film is endlessly unpredictable. Leopold is strongly against taking any sides, but is drawn in and seduced by Katharina Hartmann ( Barbara Sukowa ), the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company. What he doesn't know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the Werewolves who target American allies.",1
check out.,1
"Worth watching, if only to keep in mind one of the truly horrific events of the 20th century. I am not familiar with the details of the real Jim Jones'life, but Boothe sure makes the monster he plays believable and real. Like, ironically, the inscription in Jim Jones'camp : "" Those who don't know the past are bound to repeat it "". It is quite a gloomy spectable to watch and Boothe is quite commanding in those last moments. A disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses. Not to let it be repeated again.",1
"It has some action, some humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot.",1
"It's quite effective, and works well. Sasquatch Hunters "" actually wasn't as bad as I thought. It caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewing.",1
"Thanks for the Jeep, Tom! "" Rented the movie as a joke. I loved the credit at the end of the movie as well. """,1
I enjoyed it very much as child. Your kids will love this movie.,1
"and the final episode, Change of Address, genuinely touching. Even children's television. Let's go down to Fraggle Rock again! But they're not the only creatures.",1
"And Watch for the cameos from Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others. I don't think you will be disappointed. After seeing Dick Tracy in the 6.",1
"Will our hero sort out this thicket of crime? But Caprice's moves are making him a target for Tracy. Only Beatty plays it completely straight, the others all seem to play off of him. < br / > < br / > The spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious.",1
Al Pacino is like the Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice with zest. This is the perfect film for anybody to watch with their children.,1
"Of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross. Warren Beatty is only fair as the comic book hero. The facial makeup for the villains was great. I still liked it though. The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere. Still, this is a good movie that could have been much much more. She did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad. I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things. The movie at some points just stood still. You expected something more and you got nothing.",1

I never read those Chester - Gould - comics but it's not necessary to know them. That was great fun!,1
"I sure loved it though. Take my word for it. Plus More! I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. Warren Beaty was just like James Bond of the 1930's the way he played Dick Tracy. Plus, the famous villians are back from the comic book collection.",1
"With Dick Tracy producer / director / star Warren Beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework. The Tim Burton Batmans had it, as did ( in an even more grotesque manner ) Sin City. The film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously. Villains like The Stooge, Shoulders, Lips, The Brow, Mumbles, the Blank, Pruneface, Spud.",1

"And many thanks to make - ups. The surreal feeling really got me. 9, will you call me crazy? Maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell. < br / > < br / > To me it's not bad at all. Al Pacino was funny and prodigy to himself.",1

Gleanne Headly is Tracy's tough - talking, fiercely independent long - time girlfrined. William Forsythe and Ed O'Ross are Big Boy's enforcers, Flattop and Itchy. Mandy Patinkin is 88 Keys, piano player for Breathless's show. James Caan wears relatively little make - up in his performance as the only gangster who won't go along with Big Boy's grand plan.",1

The critics'reviews are very positive ( check out RottenTomatoes. 4. 7 / 10 average on IMDb. Just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking.,1
"Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. Check the full credits on main page and you'll amazed.",1
"I did. Spirit ends up forming a bond with the Indian, and that, in a nutshell, is the story.",1
"Time for a rant, eh : I thought Spirit was a great movie to watch. Too bad, it's a shame they couldn't have hired better musicians. Every time one of the lame songs came on, I was turned off. I can't believe no better could have been done - - I refuse to. The whole score was terrible... I thought I was back in junior high school.",1

This animated movie is a masterpiece! < br / > < br / > I saw Spirit for a third time and I want to go see it again.,1
"Spirit "" was great breath of fresh air. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. I had the same feeling. Don't get me wrong. And, there are no sudden moments where the characters break into song. I thoroughly recommend it. I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so.",1
"This movie is not just great for kids, but adults too.",1
The result is truly stunning. This movie was highly entertaining.,1
A man readjusts to life alone after 45 years of marriage.,1
"< br / > < br / > Those who appreciate horses will really like this movie, but I think it's a bit more than a horse movie. All one has to do is look around at the dwindling open areas around us to see that. I recently watched Spirit and enjoyed it very much, I've seen it about 4 times now on HBO and will buy the DVD. Doing so would take away from the story's power. In a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the rapids and the heat from a forest fire. This isn't prevalent through the entire movie though, and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappy.",1
"Your kids will love it. This was a great movie with a good story. < br / > < br / > I think the title says it all, "" spirit "". I think you will too. The music was also fantastic.",1

Overall, I rate it a 10 / 10 - a must watch. Without words, I would imagine it would have to be challenging to express them through the features. Sometimes back then ; they did treat mustangs very poorly. Spirit : Stallion of the Cimarron is an overall wonderful movie.",1
This was a really nice vacation from Lady And The Tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to.,1
"Throughout the movie, we hear a narration. This is what makes the movie so goo.",1
I liked this movie a lot. ).,1
The horse is indeed a fine animal. < br / > < br / > Soundtrack too is very impressive. huh?,1
"First of all I enjoyed the soundtrack ( Bryan Adams ), it really goes with the movie. Second the simple story, and the drama of Spirit gets your attention. I don't know, making animals talk is just so... lame.",1
8 of 10. If only ALL animation was this great.,1

"He is the dominant star of this film. This is still a superb film. The chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere. Take a look at the production design of Tony's house, take a look at the violence in this film.",1
This IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE.,1
"Robert Loggia as Tony's patron, Frank Lopez is wonderful. His character is flawed by being too trusting, and as Tony quickly figures out, soft. Mel, without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of drug industry. 'This is from the man who Frank had been paying for protection!",1

"Still, he won't stop at murder. The psychological effects of what they'doing are well depicted.",1
Crime does not pay for long! Pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation. Is that powerful enough for you? He manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression.,1
"< br / > < br / > The writing was great it was just pure Oliver Stone. Robert Loggia I have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell. Scarface should be liked and loved but not in the way it has been or is. That is a testament to him though. On the other hand Steven Bauer was at his best, still he is Steven Bauer. < br / > < br / > Brian De Palma did a very good job directing this movie. The supporting cast served its job very well. Other than Pacino they were not really any standout or memorable performances.",1
"And they, too, saw America as a land of opportunity, even as Al Capone had considered Chicago some fifty years earlier. But not all. < br / > < br / > Lopez The result was ` Scarface,'starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles. The story begins in May of 1980, when Castro opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, to allow Cuban nationals to join their families in the United States.",1
Arguebly Al Pacino's best role. The movie has a magnificent look to it.,1
He guns his way through the sunny streets of Miami where he got'the world and everything in it.,1
"Ya don't. How can you improve upon a classic? < br / > < br / > That's what Tony saw as the American dream. Also, about the violence.",1
This movie is entertaining and you will never get bored. 9 / 10 You will not be disappointed. This is masterpiece and i recommend that you see this.,1
"It is praised for all the wrong reasons. It is not a'gangster film '. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read. "" And that is why the film works so well. 'When it is anything but.",1
This is one of my all time favorites. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination.,1
The Last Hunt is the forgotten Hollywood classic western. < br / > < br / > Why did Mom fail to censor these films? The laugh here is that Bronson used to play Indians. The theme of genocide via buffalo slaughter is present in other films but never so savagely.,1
The soundtrack is all 80s! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies.,1
"< br / > < br / > The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. Every great gangster movie has under - currents of human drama. There are many stand - out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The darker side of the fabled "" American Dream "".",1
"The fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel along with Leo to Paris to meet his ex boyfriend was quite gesture from them most families I know will be reluctant to do that. This movie was for a while in my collection, but it wasn't before a friend of mine reminded me about it until I decided that I should watch it. < br / > < br / > Although the person who has aids is Leo the scenario wraps around the way in which Marcel ( the youngest brother of Leo ) coupes with the sickness of his relative. There is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together you can see them being real friends, concern about each other.",1
I think this movie showed in a very real way why HIV numbers are up in young gay men. I was very moved by this movie.,1
The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject.,1
I loved this movie.,1
"Beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about. Though fictional, it deals with a situation that is unfortunately too common - - the effect of a diagnosis of HIV on a loving close - knit family. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he takes Marcel with him but the young boy confronts Leo and demands to know the truth. Leo tells him that he is ill and Marcel is sad but accepting.

"There is also Udo Kier, the tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier's shocking second film Epidemic, though here he is mere scenery. She seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family, which owns the company which manufactures the trains.

That aside this is just great. It's very short ( under 90 minutes ) and there's never a dull moment. This movies chronicles the life and times of William Castle. A must see for Castle fans and horror movie fans. My one complaint - - there were very few sequences shown from his pictures.,1
"It also paints Castle as a larger than life character, who was very well - liked and had a smile on his face. A must see for classic horror andci - fi fans. < br / > < br / > This is about the life and work of William Castle, who in my opinion was an underrated director.

Having bought the rights to "" Rosemary'Baby "", he is put in a very special place for negotiating its film release. His gimmicks, his cost - cutting techniques and his unique vision are legendary. Hoping to direct, he is sidelined to producer in order to make way for new director Roman Polanski. He is an icon to all second - rate directors out there, which is why it's not surprising that John Waters is featured prominently in here. I knew nothing about her personal life, his goals and ambitions. Who better to control the purse of wild artist Polanski than a penny - pinching Castle?",1

"The two don't have much, but what they do have : Angels'baseball, and what they are seeking : identity. The quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time. However, the dramatic performances are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster Jay O. Sanders ( JFK, The Day After Tomorrow ). Sidekick Milton Davis Jr. delivers a tear - jerking performance as the longtime friend who never knew his parents.",1

I need this on DVD.,1
"One piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family film is one of business. In this remake they "" haunt "" the California Angels.",1
"Russ Tamblyn's halfbreed skinner and Lloyd Nolan's one - legged old - timer also give as good as they get, but real star is the script : tightly plotted with an excellent eye and I might as well have the money as well. "" Raised by Indians, he's fully aware of the damage he's doing as the disappearing buffalo heads for extinction, and he gradually becomes almost as consumed with self - loathing as Taylor is with hate. His hair color may not convince but his performance does, a shallow and violent man so consumed with hate that he doesn't wear a gun, the gun wears him. For anyone else this is one of the best of the adult Westerns of the 50s, and years ahead of its time in its attitude to the environment.",1
I guarantee. He was hilarious. You will like ( or love ) it.,1

I give it a 10 / 10! All ages will love this movie.,1

I really enjoyed this movie as a young kid.,1
It adds to the film and I'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted. It is also hilarious. A must see.,1
"If it's just a movie about an underdog kids team, then its okay. < br / > < br / > Therein lies my gripe. It's interesting, really. Its an energetic movie. I enjoy movies like this for their spirit, no pun intended. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. It gets you smiling, and really involves you in the sport.",1

"While "" Angels in the Outfield "" fails miserably in the first category, it succeeds beautifully in the latter two. """,1
This is vintage Allen humor.,1
"My vote is eight. Sondra drags Sid in her investigation, seeking for evidences that Peter is the killer. But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment.",1
She adds appropriate body language for comic effect. He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion. I cannot say that Jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none less. < br / > < br / > Allen is Allen...,1

Taylor is blinded by his hatred of Indians and his naivete that the buffalo herds will never disappear.,1
"It wasn't even at the jokes in the movie per se, but at the whole movie itself. I went into this movie knowing nothing about it, and ended up really enjoying it.",1
"Both are excellent in their banter throughout the film. The only problem is the man accused is, for all appearances, a respectable upper class man. She plays the straight part while Mr Allen does his shtick, a perfect combination.",1
"One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman ( Hugh Jackman. ) It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it. I say give it a chance because you just might like it. It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star Woody Allen. Not knowing what to do, she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her crack the case. Johansson and Allen work great together.",1
"Happily, the cards turn out to be a Tarot deck that serves as Scoop's clever Maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of Woody Allen comedy. < br / > < br / > Waterman's character also functions neatly in the plot. Like Chaplin's Calvero in Limelight ( 1952 ), Sid Waterman affords Allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative.",1
"Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack all seem to making some of the most imaginative work of their respective careers. Great movie, enough laughs and action for any audience. < br / > < br / > Check it out, it's worth trip. The second he walked on screen audience lit up.",1
"Scoop is classic Woody Allen. Allow yourself to be transported to a different, old school kind of storytelling.",1
The plot turns are nice and tight.,1
"Good Woody Allen? No. Some have said Johansson plays "" a young Dianne Keaton. """,1
"but for whatever reason, everybody seemed really into the comedy of it. Instead of archetypal ticks and quirks, Sondra's nerdishness comes directly from the family history which she shares early on. < br / > < br / > Thematically, Woody was traipsing familiar ground.",1
"Greetings again from the darkness. She is unafraid to look and act like a real person. Apparently he actually likes England!! Remember all the "" What happened to Woody Allen? "" This attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years. jokes?",1
He is totally believable in a truly villainous role. This film is definitely worth look. He did not get enough roles like this during his long career. He basically would just do what MGM gave him. This is his best performance.,1
"This time moreover Scarlett's not an ambitious sexpot and would - be movie star. < br / > < br / > Woody isn't pawing his young heroine muse - - as in "" Match Point, "" Johansson again - - as in the past.

I am still today growing up on it. what do you think? she is my favorite. and it's great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages. it is just a really great sit - com. Full House is a great show.,1
"Joey is an aspiring comedian with a kid's heart and soul. Guaranteed. Three men trying to raise three young girls = hilarious. I had a dad, two sisters, and a dog. What can I say? I think that Stephanie ( played by Jodie Sweetin ), D. J. I like the comedy of Full House, too.",1

Full House is a great family show.,1
This show is about three little girls. So the whole show is about living life. I rate it 10 / 10. I watch it almost every day.,1
I love it. This is when life was good and simple. But anyway. The Anorexic Twins became popular. This is one of the great American classics. And people knew who Dave Coulier was.,1

The group is an odd mix of good and evil, young and old. Charlie tries to seduce her to no avail, but sees that Sandy is interested in her also. This is the most compelling and excellent performance that Robert Taylor ever gave.",1

We were to have had reservations at the Vistor's Center to view this movie. < br / > < br / > See it & believe in it'powerful message! Imagine my surprise when I found myself sobbing!,1
This film is a true and historical film.,1
I highly recommend this movie for everyone.,1
"If you haven't seen it, hop on a plane to Salt Lake and see it now. You won't regret it!",1
"After all, it is apart of American History.",1
"What's important is our message and what we stand for. This movie makes a statement about Joseph Smith, what he stood for, and what the LDS church believes. Jeffs thinks of the "" Negro "" as devils. This is a movie about Joseph Smith and a great one at that.",1
!,1
"Although downbeat, this is truly great western picture. Taylor, on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo, or Indians to'being with a woman. Have no illusions, this IS a morality story.",1
"The face of Jesus is never shown, but you see the unmistakable nail marks in His hands. < br / > < br / > This movie does not clearly map out the events of Mormon Church history, but merely jumps from scene to scene. Warning : mild spoilers. The scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the Smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents. This is not a critique - simply a note about the style. I've so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing. The operation, done without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult.",1
"- Ann Pruitt - It was well acted to the point that at times I forgot that I was watching a movie. This is the most moving and real portrayal of Joseph Smith that I have ever seen. I give the movie a "" 10 "" and encourage honest souls to view it.",1
"I wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman Begins there! If you get to Salt Lake City, it is a must to see it in the Legacy Theater. I saw it at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning.",1
This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins. She has become a member of the LDS Church and he has not. Filming was awesome. I was stunned. If nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life.,1
This is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding.,1
B. One really dumb scene shows Heston emptying.,1
IMO the beginning is very good. Coburn is a really great villain in this one. Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah. His role and his acting is the best of the movie. Overall it's an entertaining western flick.,1
"Charles Coburn as the vengeful half breed Zach Provo is also at his best as the obsessed with hatred and murder escaped convict. But only after having him witness his daughter being brutally raped by his fellow convicts or are, in not being with a woman for years, as horny as a rabbit during mating season! 00 in gold coins that keeps them from breaking up and going their own way.",1
Playing Hal Brickman.. I've seen this film on Sky Cinema not too long ago.. The late James Coburn playing the villainous Zach Provo.. seeking revenge on Burgade no matter what the cost..!,1
"There were even buffalo killing contests... "" Buffalo "" Bill Cody killed thousands of buffalo... He also enjoy killing Indians who steal his horses... Some U. S. government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds...",1
"His Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired. < br / > < br / > The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western. Do he and his friends head for the Mexican border from jail and safety. Of which there is a lot. Heston is his usual stalwart hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. No they don't because Coburn has a mission of revenge. < br / > < br / > Lest we feel sorry for Coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is. It sure shows a lot of his influence with liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence. He knows that Heston has to make it personal then.",1
"In a subsequent shootout, Coburn's wife was killed ; and so Coburn is out for a most nasty sort of revenge. The music here is cribbed from Jerry Goldsmith's scores to 100 RIFLES and the 1966 remake of STAGECOACH, but it still works here. The result is a taut and violent pursuit through the mountains and deserts of southern Arizona. But that doesn't detract too terribly much from the film's psychological approach to the western genre. It is both surprisingly traditional ( good guys / bad guys ) and incredible up - to - date as well.",1
"< br / > < br / > If you are looking for something original, then I highly recommend this film.",1
"Britfilm has to try hard to be gritty and finds it hard to make it, but at warmth British films can lord it over their otherwise overwhelming competitor. Maybe. It's certainly no protest - by - numbers though, being too warm. He teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses.",1
Unfortunately this is also it's biggest drawback.,1
For me the most obvious thing that unites these no - budget movies is a real sense of fun. < br / > But back in their glory days they released this film on a very appreciative world.,1
"Melissa plays her role so well in this wanting her parents "" done away "" with so she can be with the guy she loves. I have to say that this TV movie was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is. ! So it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again.",1
I have seen it & i like it Melissa plays her part well. It was actually believable.,1
I like the movie.,1
You can see a bit of what is yet to come. My only complaint is that their appeared to be no closure. Perhaps that is part of the point. Certainly worth a watch.,1

"The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. You can watch this on the internet, so i suggest check it out.",1
"Three words caught my eye "" Melissa Joan Hart ""... You just don't expect this sort of role for that sort of actress.",1
Thomas was executed in 2000! Twisted Desire ( 1996 ) was a TV movie starring Melissa Joan Hart. The movie is based on the 1990 murders of the parents of 14 year old Jessica Wiseman. Jessica was released from prison when she turned 21 years old.,1
Melissa plays her role as the psychotic Jennifer excellently.,1
Have I just imagined this? I am sure I've seen a film which is better and closer to the novel and actually scarier.,1
I found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks. < br / > < br / > I love the movie.,1
"Yes, a true classic! I last saw this drama when it was last screened on British terrestial TV in 1994.",1

"If your teacher or guru has never been there, they can't tell you what you need to prepare for this gantlet.",1
Talk about unnerving! But only in doses does it draw upon tag. A pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you. Whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black.,1
The movie follows the book rather closely. My copy is VHS. This is a plain old spooky ghost story.,1
"< br / > < br / > If you are easily scared, AVOID THIS FILM!!!!!! !",1
"It is about time that we had legitimate region 2 DVD release. I own the book, DVD - R and have the unabridged audio book on my iPod, too. I can understand why this might not appeal to all palates. ... On stage, TV or in a book,'The Woman in Black'is an outstanding ghost story.",1

Then he brings it all to a ghastly disturbing close. < br / > < br / > TEN STARS...,1
This is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door! The first and only time I saw the woman in black was I think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on TV back in 1989.,1
All... when it comes to actually scaring people.,1
The sheer menace on the woman in black's face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread. It's remarkable that other viewers'feelings are so unanimous. < br / > < br / > I saw this when it was first on TV when I was 10 and it really did disturb me for years. I haven't seen it since I was 10 and I'm tempted to watch it again but fear I might have some sleepless nights.,1

"This movie almost has the feel of a'Masterpiece Theater'production. Most horror movies are in fact horrible movies. But the slow pacing helps give the story credibility. < br / > < br / > Subtlety can be more terrifying. Less is more. If she appeared too often, it could've cheapened the mood that gets set. I have a copy of'The Haunting ','The Changling'and a zillion more. Most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright.",1

A real gem.,1
"Try it... you * will * like it if you like traditional ghost stories... ). I recommend it. The end of movie differs to the book, but still very good.",1
"I was lucky enough to watch this without any pre viewing hype. The ending underlined the fact The older man won't even look at it, but the kids are all yelling and taunting it. Another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of church fence, watching the funeral. The other man says, "" you can't go back... alone! "" As the camera pans to the right, the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones. < br / > < br / > The many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out. and lends the hero his dog.",1
"The film becomes more harrowing the more you put yourself in Arthurs shoes, and his efforts to shake this ghost off. One is eager to learn the meaning of it all. < br / > < br / > Herbert Wise did not need blood, violence, or gore to send chills down the spines of an audience. < br / > < br / > The widow for the most part, looks vicious and intimidating. I have often woken up at night thinking she was behind me in my sleep. The writer puts many chilling additions into the story, an example being the tin soldier's re - appearance.",1
The dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and that's when it becomes really scary. < br / > < br / > The story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes. Spectacular Horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it.,1
"This one qualifies on all counts. It's the 1920s, a time when many middle - class Brits go to the seaside on vacation for "" their health. "" Waiting for the woman in black to show up is nail - bitingly suspenseful.

"Now, it must be said, to scare a jaded horror fan like that, that is nothing short of pure perfection. ! Pauline Moran surely could make the devil whimper, that's for sure!",1
It scared s * * * out of me.,1
It's what you don't see that scares.,1
"10 out of 10. The acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times. So if you want to see a truly creepy horror film give this one a look. "" Highly recommended.",1
"Still, quite acceptable, passable film. Insignificance "" is a far from great film, from a stage play, directed by Nic Roeg.",1
"History informs the script, which in turn, shakes history upside down. Goodbye, Norma Jean. As Roeg mused after watching Johnson's play for the first time, "" These characters were mythic, not invented by any single person, not the public or the press, probably not even by the characters themselves. "" Monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress, hair, lipstick, wiggle and voice.",1
"Sure the story might not lead to anything by the end, and it can feel disjointed, but the dreamy vibe and intelligent arrangement irons out those folds and makes sure it never turns giddy. One hot night, four famous iconic figures will come together. < br / > < br / > Now that's one - of - a - kind! However these limitations can't contain the fruitful and daring ideas that Roeg manages to randomly storm up visually and through the meaningful material.",1
"His films always make you think, and personally, I like that in a film. < br / > < br / > But I think it's excellent.",1
The professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we! This is a film version of Roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of Roegs cinematic flare. The last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side! She talks of being unable to have children and at one point in film she suffers a miscarriage.,1
"Nicolas Roeg's projects are variable to say the least, but are never less than interesting. "" Each character has a troubled, abused / abusive past and a questionable future. Gradually, we see that obsession itself is the central theme. Yet these aspects of the physical universe ( it's all quantum, trust me! ) Each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction.",1
"< br / > < br / > Enter Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is Red. Finally, we see the shocking terror of Einstein's vision, and the statement of the movie becomes clear. < br / > < br / > But there's more. It is utterly amazing.",1
"But he did it on a low budget. This is surely his best. And Nina Foch gives the sense of a strong woman as Julia. It lacks gangsters. < br / > < br / > The title character answers an ad. The whole cast, in fact, is superb. Undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing. She is no screaming, cowering victim. Though American - made, it is set entirely in England. But here she is far from a heroine.",1
"< br / > < br / > The acting is very good. Nevertheless, I recommend it.",1
The only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise. Why don't people believe her? Why?,1
Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position.,1
"And very modest resources. Told that she's been the victim of a nervous breakdown, she struggles to grasp the utter and seemingly hopeless nature of her predicament. A young woman ( Nina Foch ) agrees to take a position in the home of an elderly woman ( Dame Mae Witty ).",1
"We begin to feel her helplessness and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from her. They're going to kill her, but why. Her predicament makes no sense. The script never strays from Foch's dilemma. Here, she's anything but kindly or batty.",1
"The music is great, and gets stuck in your head forever...",1
Well worth catching.,1
< br / > < br / > Well done. Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little Gothic nail - biter.,1
"Although clearly low - budget, it bears the signs of clever ingenuity. And lo and behold! Having watched this film strictly on the strength of reviewers'ratings I was most pleasantly surprised. Savvy viewers will surely spot them but should rest assured they will not be disappointed.",1
"Julia Ross "" is extremely compact ( too short at 65 minutes! )",1
* * * * Shirley MacLaine in another tailor - made role.,1
"In the end one is left with the wonder of faith, family and rediscovered love. Lovely period piece capturing 1962. Strongly recommended for all ages from 9 year olds to grannies. Wonderful family drama / comedy starring MacClaine and Garr that entertains and warms the heart every time I see it.",1
"It is just that good. When I got it, I started with the pilot, and I was instantly hooked after that.",1
Especially with the Coyote!,1
"It's simple. < br / > < br / > And no, this movie does NOT need to be remade. The comparisons to the HAUNTING are superficial.",1

Scared the hell out of me. That's the wonders of DVD. But no matter.,1
"It is refreshing, therefore, to see this film. The plot is very aware of the time in which this was released, and so incorporates the great Edgar Allen Poe. The first thing you will notice about Danse Macabre is the style of the film. On the whole, fans of Italian and / or cult cinema will not want to miss this little gem!",1
"It almost feels padded. But, the night he visits is a special night. Steele makes most any film worth seeing.",1
The music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing. Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful.,1
"This film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. George Riviere, the male lead, does a good job with his role. John R. Tracy Barbara Steele, is her usual beautiful / creepy self.",1
"Once there, the writer wanders around the dusty rooms and corridors, until music and a glimpse of a waltzing couple lead him into an empty room. The alluring, captivating Barbara Steele is main reason to see it. Recommended! She has a strange charisma unlike anyone else you've ever seen in the movies. Thus begins a startling series of supernatural events that bewilder the journalist all the rest of the night.",1
"No wonder I was so scared! It stars 60's scream queen icon Barbara Since it was a French - Italian import, it wasn't a movie that showed up on the late show in Winnipeg. What a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years! Though all three films frightened me, it was Castle of Blood that had the most profound impact. I had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards! Though I didn't know it then, all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre.",1
"If you're a fan of Gothic horror, then you're definitely absolutely guaranteed to LOVE this wondrous Italian 60's film "" Castle of Blood "". One of them, Silvano Tranquilli, even gives away a fairly credential depiction of author Edgar Allan Poe.",1
I won't deny that.,1
The long - delayed climax of Leo's awakening comes about 20 minutes late. The problem with the movie is in its structure. You should see it at least once. I will take an ambitious failure over a mass - market hit any day. < br / > < br / > The compositions are stunning. Where is the DVD?,1
"Sometimes, characters switched between the two in the middle of a scene! It seems like an easy bet to win - - even if the house is very creepy. See it for yourself to find out the rest of the story. Odd, but still watchable. How can this be?!",1
I would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers.,1
Perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost? Overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white. 8 out of 10. Barbara Steele definitely makes movie too.,1
"Filmed in black and white, it manages to convey a genuinely creepy miasma. And boy, was it ever! Not for nothing has she been called "" The Queen of Horror. """,1
"As soon as Foster enters the eerie castle, mysterious things start to happen. Antonio Margheriti's "" Danza Macabra "" aka. """,1
A masterpiece! The film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of me.,1
"She makes the movie a ten! Kind of weird. Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage? That scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited.",1
Just watch it. Ja - pan is purely comedy. Yakitate! Ja - pan ( translated as Fresh Baked!,1

And my children love it now!,1
Japan is one of those shows. Yakitate!,1
Even theme song alone is funny. These images will not make sense unless you see the anime. I truly laughed.,1
"( he was never caught ). This movie is obviously low - budget & filmed in British Columbia, Canada.",1
Another comment about this film made it sound lousy. Davis was so young and fresh.,1
"Davis'realism was monumental. I WIPED MY MOUTH!! """,1
The acting is indeed fine in most every respect. Too bad she wasn't playing a gangster's moll.,1
"When I saw that this film was only 80 minutes long, I thought we were in trouble. Davis is intense to the point of scary. I didn't know what on earth the appeal of Mildred was in the book, and the movie stays true to that detail.",1
"If she seems at times over top, she came from the stage, and the subtleties of film acting would emerge later for her. She was a true actress and a true < br / > < br / > "" Of Human Bondage "" looks rather stilted today in parts. He shines in material like his role opposite Davis in "" It's Love I'm After "" or "" The Petrified Forest "" which call for his kind of technique. In truth, Mildred is repulsed by Philip's club foot.",1
"The songs, especially "" Forever Young "" are very sweet and memorable.",1
And it was the latter role that launched her among the greatest stars. The story is simply too big to be told in mere 83 minutes. But Ms Davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite. But even that is not all.,1
"Bette Davis'characterization was famous for inspiring a "" write - in "" campaign for the 1934 "" Best Actress "" Academy Award. The results were : < br / > < br / > 1. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard's struggles, instead, to become a doctor. Bette Davis - "" Of Human Bondage "" < br / > < br / > 4.",1
I don't make this claim lightly. The movie may be great.,1
"Even though she has no interest in him and basically treats him like dirt, Phillip is obsessed. When out at a tearoom he meets a sullen waitress, Mildred ( Bette Davis ). You just want to shake him. It is so hard to watch his efforts at trying to find any civility in this vicious shrew.",1
"As the heartless waitress who jerks Philip, a sensitive medical student, around and nearly ruins his life, Davis is way too shrill, almost demonic. I imagine the character of Millie as quieter, less feminine than Davis, with maybe a touch of the tomboy. His wan, somewhat wilted good looks are perfect for this failed aesthete. Director John Cromwell, who usually elicited good performances from his actresses, was perhaps overwhelmed by this one. < br / > < br / > As Philip, Leslie Howard is excellent. Davis is watchable, for sure, but so strident and predatory as to seem scarcely human. Her acting in this one doesn't come off well by today's standards. This 1934 adaptation of Somerset Maugham's novel put Bette Davis on the map as a movie actress.",1
You be the judge! It was startling for me to see how young Ms. Davis looks in this move. The film seems rather dated now in 2003.,1
"Although man eating Mildred may at times seem one dimensional, she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that Philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her. The only character I found hollow was Sally's eccentric, ale slurping aristocratic father who Mildred may have a grating voice, but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel, making it somewhat understandable why Philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did. It is perhaps this passivity, these lowered expectations that makes him put up with the selfish Cockney waitress for as long as he does. One may also think she is on to something when she accuses Philip of looking down on her for not being "" fine "" enough. The story is somewhat stilted, what with the main character's sudden reversals of fortune, but Leslie Howard and Bette Davis's portrayals of Philip Carey, the naïve obsessed lover and Mildred Rogers, the unworthy object of his affections, raise this film considerably above standard melodrama. ( The scene in which Philip and Norah dismiss romance magazines as trash for kitchen maids seems to confirm this ).",1
What a mysterious and almost spooky film. I loved how the music went with the pace of each step of Philip's feet.,1
It was impossible to take her character seriously. So I bought it. He was a subtle and intelligent actor The supporting actors acquit themselves well. It wasn't as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke'Mary Poppins'cockney accent but close. Worth watching despite Ms Davis vocal gymnastics.,1
"In fact, I like it very much. 8 / 10 Bethany Cox And the ending is a real tearjerker.",1
"Of Human Bondage is a fascinating piece of cinema despite its superficial faults. It also has to be viewed in perspective. It is beautifully conceived, shot and edited. Bette Davis'cockney accent in this film is absolutely appalling. A fine example of his skillful direction is the scene set at Victoria Station.",1
Davis rose the stardom with her performance. Both will play again in ¨Petrified forest¨ ( 1936 ). Rating : Very good but a little bit dated. The motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs.,1
He starts buying her things even pays for her apartment. He is constantly thinking about her. Finally Sally and her dad takes him in. Bette Davis plays Mildred. She has TB. This is a woman who men are drawn to. So what the nookie is too good. His med school grades are even failing.,1
"The character of Philip Carey in Somerset Maugham's OF HUMAN BONDAGE is soulful too. Witness his poet - dreamer - wanderer in THE PETRIFIED FORREST. I happen to like Leslie Howard, in his better films. He is sensitive for several reasons.",1
"For, it's in "" Dangerous "" ( 1936 ) that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. The public began to notice Bette Davis as a star because of her performance "" Of Human Bondage. "" She was only 25yo when the film was completed & just about to reach Hollywood's red carpet. Doubtless, she deserved more than 2 Oscars ; perhaps as many as 6. < br / > < br / > "" Dangerous "" provides an exemplary contrast in Davis'depth of acting characterization. Every motion picture Bette Davis stars in is worth experiencing. That is what makes it her legendary performance.",1
"Re - enter Mildred, replete with a baby, and in her usual need of being taken care of. < br / > < br / > The movie reasonably but not entirely follows Exit heartbroken Norah. Perhaps author / physician Maugham didn't care for distaff medicos ). Her Cockney accent is as sharp as Eliza Doolittle's. No sex here.",1
How amazing this film is! Radio Pictures ). Her body was so curvy when she was young.,1
I think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me. Several features of this film immediately date it. It is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face.,1
She makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time. Watching her performance is still spellbinding.,1
"So this movie was also good for my imagination. I won't deny that. I used to watch it at least once a week. Get the picture? < br / > < br / > "" What good is love and caring if it can't save her? "" Sure it's darker than the first one too, but perhaps maybe that's why it's so good.",1
Mildred has him spend himself into poverty buying her gifts and taking her out to the theater every time she off from work. Later to Philip's shock and surprise Mildred walks back into his life.,1
"When he tries to cling onto Mildred, she rejects him. < br / > < br / > The film is dominated by Mildred from the start. Her disgust toward kind Philip is clear from the onset of their relationship.",1
"All much in the style back then. After 21 movies and three years of working in Hollywood Bette Davis finally got a role she claimed as her own and which put her as a force to be reckoned with. < br / > < br / > At circa 85 minutes, the story moves at a nice pace, telling the story of Philip Carey ( Howard ) as his life crosses that of the destructive Mildred Rogers over and over again.",1
It has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung - fu.,1
"This sets up lots of really funny moments, and lots of great fight choreography. < br / > < br / > Also unique and of note is blending of kung fu and the craft of bamboo scaffold building. The film centres around the local dye mill, where wages are cut due to the hiring of 10 new Manchurian bosses. which he first tests during a dust - up with the monastery's Abbot.",1
"Nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung - fu the unorthodox way. < br / > < br / > Act One sets up the premise. With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non - contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment.",1

The movie recreation of the 1930's is colorful and elegant ( look at Debbie's clothes! ) The two stars and Curtis Harrington stylish direction easily overcomes its flaws. Instead we get Debbie Reynolds musicals interludes and dancing tots, although fun to watch take too much screen time of what is supposedly to be a psychological chiller.",1

"The cubs are just too adorable, I rewind that'Flying My Colors'scene. As I got older I learned to prefer this one. It leaves an effect on you. I always sat down and watched the first one. A big hand to Carol and Dean Parks. It was really surprising. I tend to annoy everyone by singing it. I think it is a wonderful movie. < br / > < br / > The sound track is great! Again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality.",1
"It's a lot of fun. Romantic comedies are tough movies. plot is going to make everyone happy. Sure, maybe you like it, but maybe it doesn't ring true, or you think it's cruel. _ A Guy Thing _ covers that.",1
"Very few of the film's gags are high - brow, but they made me laugh. But I still miss his work in independent films. In other words, her beauty shows inside and out. < br / > < br / > The cast is talented. I loved her so much in "" Air Julia Stiles proves again why she's so damn likable.",1
"I'did'like this movie! Jason Lee is a star, but he is not tomorrows leading man. '... Perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else. Selma Blair is a good young actress as well, and does an'ok'job. Chris Koch delivers another film that is'above average '.",1
Go see. This was actually a fun movie.,1
"Maybe that's one source of disappointment. < br / > < br / > Lee doesn't live up to his costars, i don't think, but you could view that as more that they're hard to live up to.",1
"This movie is all right. All smooth sailing until he takes his "" bachelor hat "" off. I got to say this is one of his good leading roles. A new low, right?",1
Suddenly Karen telephones. Will Karen ever find out that Becky spent the night at Paul's place? Talk about some explaining to do! She's on her way to Paul's apartment. I'm sorry for critics who pan movies like this.,1

"Anyway, better movies to watch but definitely not worst pick...",1
"The movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance. Of course, the next thing Paul knows, it's the morning after the night before, he's in bed with a naked hula dancer, and his mother - in - law phones to inform him that Karen is on her way over.

8. So I stick Orson and Rita in the player and I'm treated to class and confusion in equal measure. I did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a Welles box set I had recently purchased. A box set I chiefly got because I wanted to own A Man For All Seasons and to also re - evaluate Waterloo.,1
He was and remains a unique force in film. I like the accent. This film certainly reinforces that impression. Watch it and be grateful for chance. I concur.,1
( 10 / 10 ) This film is brilliant.,1
Even the great Mr. Welles.,1
"For five years in Hollywood it was barely a great record. < br / > < br / > The story goes that Welles, with a $ 10, 000. So the marriage was going on the rocks as well. But despite the assistance Mike Todd, and Cole Porter composing the score, the musical was a failure. But the credit went to Stevenson. < br / > < br / > By 1946 Welles'position as a Hollywood figure was mixed.",1
The only faults I find with the movie is Welles'ill - advised Irish accent and perhaps some of the erratic editing in the first act. < br / > < br / > Certain set - pieces stand out. I believe heavily chopped versions of Shangai and Ambersons attain a surreal quality for that matter.,1
That scene alone is worth the price of admission. No one should miss this picture.,1
"Eventually, Grisby asks O'Hara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme. Later, he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him. The Lady from Shanghai ended up at a very low "" C "", or a 7, for me. I had a problem with most of the performances, the script and the overall structure. < br / > < br / > The Lady from Shanghai is really all about Orson Welles'character, Michael O'Hara.",1
"This cartoon was strange, but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion to it than other cartoon movies.",1
"Nevertheless, he is always compelling. Here Welles is doing quadruple duty - as director, star, co - writer and narrator. He made "" Lady from Shanghai "" for his soon to be ex - wife, Rita Hayworth. Still, this movie drags. It's a shame.",1
"The most interesting performance in the movie is Glenn Anders'as Grisby, Sloan's loony, treacherous law partner. The Lady From Shanghai is weird even by the standards of its eminent director, Orson Welles, whose last Hollywood film this was for many a moon. Welles does not.",1
Mike ( Welles ) and Elsa fall for each other. myspace.,1
"Awesome, just awesome.",1
"In fact, he was playing. Welles films shouldn't be evaluated against others.",1
Please see them all! it is really ignorant. Can anyone give me a best list for the 90's and on up to 2006? No Offense to any of great film makers of this millennium! He is also wonderful in a Touch Of Evil. Where else can you plug a film or boo it! Thank you!,1
"It doesn't matter, however. Check out the courtroom scene. Or just take a look at the lighting in that scene. Orson Welles manages to knock me on my ass with every picture of his I see. 10 / 10. Usually they are such stock scenes that I can't stand them. His direction defines what great direction is.",1
"But things don't go to plan. It was a terrific marketing ploy, and he change suits her changed attitude wonderfully. < br / > < br / >'The Lady From Shanghai'is film noir at it's most sizzling and confusing. Hayworth is beautifully photographed here, and she is a far - cry from her famous'Gilda'role.",1
"The first mystery is to guess what Welles'original film was like. The first real noir, but even darker. < br / > < br / > So in telling this story, Welles has to make the environment into a character. Several characters as suspects in the mystery. What we can see firsthand is someone creating a vocabulary that would later become common. The camera's eye was shocking, but experimental. < br / > < br / > If you do, you will both see and experience perhaps one of the best film mysteries ever.",1
Not to mention Care Bears are just too adorable! The second Care Bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor.,1
< br / > < br / > 10 / 10 Don't miss this artistic noir film from one of great film directors. Critics need to review what they class as a quality movie. I think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the Matrix style of films.,1
"Not received well at the time, The Lady from Shanghai has gotten more and more critical acclaim as years pass. Nevertheless Sloane takes an apparent liking to Welles and hires him to skipper his yacht. < br / > < br / > So far this film is starting to sound a lot like Gilda. Gotten better with age so to speak. < br / > < br / > Stage actor Glenn Anders plays Sloane's partner Grisby who is one slimy dude, he winds up a corpse. Supposedly Harry Cohn hit the roof as Rita was internationally known for her coppery red hair. < br / > < br / > Welles for whatever reason decided that his wife would be a blond in this film.",1
"The plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of film techniques. Unfortunately, it is Welles'obsession with technical filmmaking that hurts this film in its entirety.",1
"< br / > < br / > Welles co - stars with his then wife, the profoundly gorgeous Rita Hayworth, as Mike O'Hara, an Irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people. As I watched one of Orson Welles'last contributions to Hollywood as a filmmaker, I knew I was watching a great movie unfold, though at times I did not know why.",1
"The Lady From Shanghai "" gets four stars from this impartial arbiter.",1
"One can only imagine the film Mr. Welles might have finished without the interference of the studio! < br / > < br / > Rita Hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here. No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles. < br / > < br / > We can see the toll it took on Orson Welles the filming of this movie. Had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret Michael O'Hara, a different film might have been achieved altogether. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to movie.",1
"It has a conventional 1940's premise told in a most unconventional way, and I am sure some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. After CITIZEN KANE in 1941, Hollywood executives turned their cob - webbed backs on the great Orson Welles. Instead of a slick, wise tongue, he speaks with a rough, Irish twang. < br / > < br / > Beside being arguably the greatest director of all - time, Welles was also quite a performer as an actor.",1
Welles'is as fascinating as always. Great stuff!,1
"Instead, the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a Silly Symphony : a pratfall by Pluto the Pup, or a wild jump into space by Donald Duck... Throughout we have musical references to "" Please Don't Kiss Me "" for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material. The preview title music was written by a first rate composer, George Antheil. In other words, if somebody falls down, he makes a "" falling down "" sound in the orchestra, etc., etc...",1
The songs are sweet and memorable. My favourite is Swift Heart Rabbit.,1
Praise to all fearless filmmakers! People seem to have major problems with the transgenered. What is so taboo about love?! Especially independent films.,1
I loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. I found the director / actor's style of directly addressing me / the audience very engaging. I look forward to more offerings from this creative talented director.,1
< br / > < br / > One critical point though : the soundtrack is sometimes a little bit annoying.,1
"So Izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in Kabuki theater. I went to see Ashura as 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. Man, that was one cool kick off. It's by far, the movie that looks the most like a manga.",1
"< br / > < br / > If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese Fantasy / Swordplay epic, you'd be wrong. ? Not to be misleading, the film is not all action, but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy. In fact, there's nothing typical about Ashura. It is a hodge - podge of many different genre's of film. Some of the humor seems contrived, and out of place. Japan is in serious trouble. But seriously, do you watch Fantasy / Swordplay / Comedy films for the great acting performances? And the acting isn't the greatest. Those just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama, and romance. < br / > < br / > To be sure, there are flaws in the film.",1
"In order to save the world from Demons there are Demon - slayers. These are the basic premises. Generally speaking Demons look and act like humans, but are evil. From here the story gets interesting.",1
I felt the same way watching it as an adult! ! Very dark for a kiddy flick eh? Demons and baby Care Bears IN THE SAME MOVIE!!!!,1

and that was funny when she sprayed him in the eye in the store. it's called back - up. now i don't think i myself could ever trust a cop like that. but that's what i think an thought about movie. hahahahaha.,1
I wish Verducci would make more movies. < br / > < br / > Many suspects in this one.,1
i mean it's exciting.,1
I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot. But I think he did okay. Kevin just seems too sweet for me.,1
Totally memorable - like she really exists. So is that acting? That doesn't matter ; she's still cool as a nerd. But she doesn't do things the normal teenager would do.,1
"In fact everyone in the cast does a good job. Over the past decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances. Pat Verducci also has the writing credit. < br / > < br / > Alicia Silverstone is pretty good in this one. Just a thought! I think it is an entertaining story worth seeing. Bill Nunn played "" Captain Arends "". I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start.",1
"He has to work alone as his boss General Perry ( Myron Healey ) wants it kept ultra quiet. I think its a great horror / sci fi film. Anyway, I really like this film. Which surprised me. Nelson can't even tell his wife Judy ( Ann Sweeny ). While in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease. Stalking human prey he begins his reign of terror! He wakes up in a hospital bed, he looks in a mirror and before his very eyes his face is melting!",1
"As a kid in the 50s thats all there was. Bravo! In 1957 I saw "" The First Man Into Space "" in a movie theater with my Dad.",1
< br / > < br / > A new fan. It is a quality short that I haven't seen in quite some time. It chills you right to the bone.,1
"Wow. For some strange reason, STAR WARS became a household name, and INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN did not. < br / > < br / > Storywise, surprisingly little happens during the movie. Why did they... but how come he... why are they...? "" This movie you've popped in... isn't a normal movie. The melting guy wanders around killing people.",1
"( "" It's incredible! His dialogue is so trite it's unbelievable!",1
"The climax is especially fun. It seems to me to be kind of a goof on low - budget genre efforts from the'50's and 60's, and as such, it's a marvelously entertaining movie. His comrades are killed instantly, but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones. Astronaut Steve West ( Alex Rebar ) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of Saturn.",1
"The melting man is played by one Alex Rebar, who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film. He appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for TV anthology horror piece called HOUSE OF THE DEAD ( or THE < br / > < br / > Don't let the door hit you on the way out either. Hilarious.",1
"In shock after seeing his face in the mirror ( can you blame him? The melting dude's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! ), Steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind. The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of film. Another big advantage is that William Sachs'screenplay doesn't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches.",1
"I saw it again this morning on "" Turner South "". I saw this movie in 1959 when I was 11 years old at a drive - in theater with my family. The Mating Game "" is a unique classic from a by - gone age.",1
"Debbie Reynolds is great, as always. < br / > < br / > Loved it. My wife and I would go see it.",1
"Ever read a tax code? He sends Tony Randall to check out the situation. They make a cute couple actually. And comes up with a very large tax bill, that will possibly ruin Douglas's family. Most people will never have any use for these.",1
"Excellent farce! Which, of course, is all it is intended to be. Could the plot actually take, or have taken place in any particular time or location?",1
eventually after about a week of looking i found it on atom films. even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling. < br / > < br / > GREAT FILM!,1
Nope - - you'll hate it. A really nice little curio from late 1950s. That's really about all the plot there is.,1
"In a synthetic viewpoint, the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness. They are mutually related.",1
"Many doors are shown in the screen, opened and closed. Have you noticed that?",1
"Kate Beckinsale as Emma seems more interesting, almost, though. They're both good in different ways.",1
"< br / > < br / > As a general rule, much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit feature movie length. Perhaps as a result, even with Kate Beckinsale in the lead, this production sank without trace. Bernard Hepton as Emma's feeble father was also excellent. An outstanding example is "" Brideshead Revisited "" which had 13 50 - minute episodes back in 1982.",1
"Emma is a remarkable person, but she is flawed.",1
! I liked it so much that I watched it twice in two days!!,1
the settings are so spectular.,1
"She is, however, just as convincing as Austen's well - intentioned but often wrong - headed heroine. Then two came along in the same year, 1996. Until the 1990s there had never been a film based upon Jane Austen's "" Emma "". Instead, her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends.",1
It's worth watching to find out how. Old Jane's mannered tale seems very popular these days.,1
She is wonderful. Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! Mark Strong did a fabulous job.,1
It seems put on. I also love the new scene at the end. Pity...... Well done to Kate Beckingsale! I was always borderline with the other Emma.,1
All the characters are well - portrayed.,1
< br / > < br / > 10 out of 10 < br / > < br / > My 2 cents! I've seen this movie after watching Paltrow's version.,1
"For me this production was and remains a delight. Of the spate of Austen films from the 1990s, this is my favorite, more even than "" Persuasion, "" which was the one that converted me to Austeniana.",1
"This production is, in short, great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure.",1
Kake Beckinsale's Emma is irreproachable.,1
"It's sobering to see how different everything was back then. "" He is glue that holds everything together. Spring Byington is seen as Emily, the mother. < br / > < br / > Lionel Barrymore plays Judge Hardy with conviction.",1
"I've been searching for way too long, someone help! !",1
I think it would be winner. The car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 era. Spring Byington performance is excellent as usual.,1
Haven't read it yet. Tintin and I recently aired as an episode of PBS's P. O. V. series. Her name is Fanny and she is interviewed here. and the dedication page.,1
"On the whole, I come out of this movie knowing a few more things about Herge and seeing him as a bit more unlikable than when I come in to the theater.",1
This film will give you a new appreciation for the work of Herge.,1
I'ts so brilliant and a very cool production.,1
"< br / > < br / > Hergé lived the turbulent life of a true, suffering artist. Tintin and I "" first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary.",1
that I came across it ( yes I had seen an advert for it previously but of course forgotten about it and looked forward to an'early night '... ).,1
I used to borrow the books from the school library every chance I got. Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid.,1
However if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a look. High recommended.,1
"Four macho rough'n'tumble guys and three sexy gals venture into a remote woodland area to hunt for a bear. Better still, both yummy blonde Marisol Santacruz and lovely brunette Adriana Vega supply some tasty eye candy by wearing skimpy bathing suits.",1
"My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few. So there must be something. And which format that would be?",1
"< br / > < br / > Overall, INFERNAL TRAP is a nice slasher film from the late 80's. 10 out of 10. Once sun comes up, all of them try and make it out, but fall victim one by one. Nothing new, just well acted, fast paced and some pretty ladies.",1
"Talk about a blast opening, "" Trampa Infernal "" has the coolest opening credits ever!",1
"The band dissolved, albeit unofficially, in 1982 and pop lost one of its most celebrated artists. < br / > < br / > The film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel.",1
I would not give criticism to any of the actors.,1
Full of profound emotions from every angle.,1
Obviously yes.,1
"It has everything : action, romance etc.",1
"< br / > < br / > 8 10 I caught this movie on my local movie channel, and i rather enjoyed watching the film.",1
This is one of the few movies I watched twice in the theatre. I cannot understand that one single bit. Isn't this a rather consoling thought?,1
Stellar performances all around.,1
"Glenn Close is Ferula. At first I didn't didn't like it that much, although I did. I pictured her just like that, only not in mourning throughout the whole thing.",1
"The actors all do a great job, too.",1
"In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance, with great wisdom, Solomon describes in these words : "" The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you. "" < br / > < br / > Unforgettable Glenn Close playing splint, the tainted sister of Stephen, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. Meryl Streep also brilliant, a woman whose name came to him like a glove Clara.",1
What is told is told fairly well. < br / > < br / > The acting is excellent.,1
After all supranatural stuff is a part of the culture in the third world.,1
"This, in my view, is one of the best films of the 1990s.",1
"But the acting, I think, was terrific. I think don´t belong at that time. The best proof I really liked it, I'm writing a review 7 years later.",1
"For my money, there is no comparison between the two. This 1991 NBC - TV movie aired six months before John Goodman's big - screen version of the life of Babe Ruth came out. The TV production isn't perfect but it presents the Babe's story with more depth and complexity than Goodman's one - dimensional telling.",1
The film is based entirely on a pair of hapless lovers.,1
A true classic.,1
"If you get a chance to see this film, then do.",1
< br / > < br / > Arletty played the part of prostitute well - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! But no problem - it's still a much underrated lovely composition from Marcel Carne. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre - War France or simply idiots? All in all : wonderful.,1
"Atmosphère? What's fascinating today is this popular little world, the canal Saint - Martin settings. This is our French "" Nobody's perfect "".",1
"Annabella is very beautiful, but not very good at doing tragic, while Aumont's callowness, brilliantly appropriate though it may be, by its nature obtrudes any real, felt, romance. Fragile Carne, just before his great period. Of course, this affair is not meant to be plausible - they are symbolic of youth, hope and possibility being crushed in France, or maybe France itself, despairing, resigned, waiting for death. Their high - flown lines are rather embarrassing too. Maybe it's just me, but I find it hard toympathise with a couple, so young, so attractive, who, after only a few months, are so racked with despair that they have to shoot each other.",1
"There is no replacing Dressler, for sure, but for me German father is more believable and honest in his performance. Garbo is if anything more commanding ( or more beautiful as a screen presence ) and her acting is more restrained.",1
"). Is it better than Clarence Brown's? She does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking. Is Jacques Feyder's film different? < br / > < br / > Yet, the film differs in one very important issue : rest of the cast.",1
"The strength she brought to the character remains here, although it has been softened, and Garbo reveals more of Anna's vulnerability. He captured Garbo's luminescence and the atmospherics of the docks with style. Even William Daniels cinematography seems improved over his filming of the Brown version.",1
"A good film, well worth renting!",1
"But, then I saw Zentropa ( Europa ) and my faith was renewed. Enjoy!",1
This version of Anna Christie is in German.,1
< br / > < br / > Serious Flick.,1
"The effects are simply breath taking and would work at their greatest power in the big screen. Master director Ching Siu Tung's perhaps most popular achievement is this series, A Chinese Ghost Story 1 - 3. Ghost Story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere, which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost. < br / > < br / > This film is no less full of magic than other films by Ching Siu Tung. This is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happiness.",1
this is a great movie. xiao qian is very pretty too.,1
"So the main theme is the guy trying to save beautiful ghost. Wasn't quite sure what to expect with this one, outside of the uniform positive reviews I've read. Highly recommended.",1
"), A Chinese Ghost Story is a completely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish.",1
!,1
"Mostly very funny, sometimes even scary.",1
A knockout.,1
The result is pure beauty.,1
"After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look great. Not to repeat other reviews here. The score is very good and moving.",1
The story is engrossing and original. The villains are appropriately menacing and frightening. Wu Ma is hilarious as the cantankerous Taoist who aids the young lovers. The direction is superb. This film offers something for every film fan. The sets are creepy and atmospheric.,1
There are 21 comments as I add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism.,1
Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his portrayal of the mysterious Swordsman Yin. Find a copy anywhere you can. < br / > < br / > Enough good things can't be said about this film.,1
"Highly recommended 10 / 10. It's absolutely among the best I've ever seen. Of course, it happens to be haunted as well.",1
"The film takes in elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package. An ethereal treasure, highly recommended.",1
"It's definitely laugh - out - loud. More fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it. Bravo! First things first, the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed.",1
"Sinnui yauman, is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film. The trek alone is perilous with wolves, and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple. < br / > < br / > A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details. She is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress, but when she meets innocent Ling Choi Sin they fall in love.",1
"The trek alone is perilous with wolves, and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple. It's a masterpiece of Hong Kong Cinema. Its my life. She is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress, but when she meets innocent Ling Choi Sin they fall in love. The story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm.",1
This movie is one of my favourites. This minor flaw is easily ignored. Absolutely recommended. The visuals are beautiful too. There is so much to discover in this story.,1
And the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of this! 10 / 10,1
"It's about sacrifice, for sacrifice is an essential component of True Love. In a Hong Kong Movie? )",1
!,1
"His crafting of the perfectly choreographed high flying, tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best HK cinema has ever created. Forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned, this is the original and best. This is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting.",1
Very funny film. Classic film funny Eddie Murphy of the 80s. That's.,1
I think the end is very worth sticking around. What I especially love about this movie is the comical use of bread and all the common household enemies bread has a grudge against.,1
"This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult.",1
"< br / > < br / > Though the themes are crusty and stale to today's viewers, it is by no means a crumby waste of time.",1
"She has meanwhile had a lover ( Patric Knowles ) whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either. He is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty. They continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and socialize as if nothing were wrong. But as always happens in the movies, and sometimes even in life, some unexpected things begin to go wrong, and the tension rises appreciably, so that Fontaine begins to sweat. He is a charming, feckless, but wholly amiable fellow. Hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning. Joan Fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself. She meets the aging Herbert Marshall, who has a yacht with all the trimmings and more money than even Fontaine could figure out how to spend. She targets him and decides he will do nicely.",1
Did anyone spot him? Or the ballroom scene? It appears to be England.,1
She's just her usual Joan Fontainey self. Warning : contains a spoiler. Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting.,1
Catch it if you can!,1
"Poor Ivy : Though to the manner born, she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel ( Richard Ney ).",1
I highly recommend this film. Joan Fontaine stars as the villain in this Victorian era film.,1
Great old movie drama. Wish they still made films like this. Loved Joan.,1
"H. B. Warner's performance here is, as always, perfect. The sets look phony. < br / > < br / > So we have here a flawed but very interesting version.",1
The fair from a distance almost gives a sci - fi feel to the movie.,1
"The Sea is Watching was an interesting film experience. It was obvious what we were to look at in each frame. It wasn't that I like fight scenes au contraire but it seemed a little stilted and again, overly dramatic. First of all, the overall feel was intense, internalized, claustrophobic, and small. < br / > < br / > Otherwise, while not a beautiful movie to watch, it provided an interesting glimpse into the darker side of prostitution ( as opposed to the geisha ). No panoramic views.",1
"In fact, this movie is prettier than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself.",1
Watching it will be a pleasure!,1
"Perhaps not his best, but even at his worst, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. It is touching, funny and intriguing in all parts. The character development is near perfect, the cinematography is vivid and engaging, and the story draws you in.",1
"Beautiful scenery. It's real feel good movie and I can only recommend it to everybody. It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. The movement of the camera is superb, as well as the actors.",1
You won't be disappointed.,1
It is a comedy with a touch of fantasy. They are not accurate on this film. You wont regret it! Just a beautiful view!,1
"< br / > < br / > It is uniquely Akira Kurosawa! It is a tale of survival of women in feudal Japan. < br / > < br / > This movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of Okabasho, Japan. The samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak one, while the classless lovers prove to be honorable ones. His view of the Japanese world and caste system is renowned and sheds light upon how these systems interact with each other.",1
Each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha. The acting is a bit strained The sea is watching and will find protection for true love. Oshin's heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically / monetarily by Kikuno and the other geishas.,1
I think this is one of Kurosawa's better stories.,1
Costumes and settings are brilliant ; especially the district of the okiyas is skillfully built.,1
I can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledge. This is a complete art work about the women's life and needs in this era.,1
It's a great example of both.,1
< br / > < br / > The film was full of beautiful touches. < br / > < br / > The whole movie is a real treat!,1
"Charlotte Lewis, Eddie's costar is hot. This movie was good for it's time.",1
I loved the the film. a great pity.,1
"The revolutionaries, of whom we see and about whom we learn very little, might as well be mafiosi. But so is everyone else in the film. He's respectful of his father but disobedient too. She's a good actress. ( I'm guessing here. )",1
"It's jarring and unnecessary and I am in the camp that believes that the film would not have been harmed any if the scene had been removed from it. But the oral sex scene, I feel, derails the focus on the actual story. < br / > < br / > Overall : Wonderful film hampered by a much not - needed sex scene.",1
"One day, he follows her, and his persistence pays off. rated versions.",1
"Kept awake by loud noises above her apartment, she soon discovers that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building.",1
"In the latter version, I believe everyone is referred to as "" Father "". I have videotaped both versions off broadcast TV, so no, I'm not imagining this. ( Kind of reminds me of Raymond Burr cutaway scenes in "" Godzilla "" ).",1
Excellent film really. He really impression.,1
Probably one of my all time favorites. 9 / 10 It's wacky and extremely creepy!,1
( Cinemax uncut and in HD no less! ),1
"I. G. movie LIPSTICK ). Ahh, yes, the all - star blockbuster. ), from the mysteriously accommodating broker Miss Logan ( Golden Age screen vet Ava Gardner, fresh from the storm drain in EARTHQUAKE. )",1
< br / > < br / > 7 / 10 Great for all generations.,1
"The film is imaginatively photographed, and the eerie old Brooklyn mansion is a fantastic setting for this kind of film. The film features many sinister and eccentric characters, and the cast is superb. The new apartment, however, comes along with a bunch of very strange other tenants.",1
"However it's disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what's really going on here. Is there a reason for all of this, and why is it surrounding Raines'character? As a whole it's sketchy, however remains intriguing by instilling an ominous charge without going gang - busters with the scares. It's interesting to see names like Sylvia Miles ( who's significantly creepy! This is where Winner tries to pull out eerie shades, which projects some icy moments. Then you got a mild - mannered Chris Sarandon and movingly gorgeous Cristina Raines in the leads. There's plenty too.",1
"The flashback scenes are what really made it for me. Burgess Meredith is terrific as Chazen. He had an instant screen presence, and I couldn't help but love him. The ending I consider to be one of the finest in Horror history. The Sentinel has the perfect build up of tension. Beverly D'Angelo has one chilling scene, that I won't spoil. Well worth the look.",1
"Time has not been kind to this movie. Still, it is an enjoyable movie, especially for those viewers who enjoy stargazing. Overall, pretty entertaining.",1
"Michael Winner does a good job with his central location, as the block of flats provides a creepy and macabre setting for the story. The plot is rich with mystery, and begins by focusing on Alison Parker and her hunt for a flat.",1
"This movie isn't all bad, and still has a capacity to shock. This falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her life. The damned souls at the end are portrayed by actual sideshow freaks and geeks. Ava Gardner is elegant as the realtor unaware of the horrors lurking in her rental property. That's a pity. < br / > < br / > The cast was competent.",1
"If this house really does sit atop entrance to Hell, I take it that Hell is... the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But we New Yorkers have known THAT for some time!",1
"Especially when she quickly drops the rental price from $ 500. This happens to be one of my favorite horror films. Alison's response is very logical - "" Blind? Then what does he look at? "" 00.",1
"There is almost no gore. The plot twists are lovely, if a tad predictable. The direction is quite sparta. This movie is creepy and creative. The climax, of which I will give no detail, is disturbing and quite impressive.",1
I highly recommend you not watch it alone.,1
"An ominous music score by Gil Melle adds to the menace. There's also some gore to be seen, but not very much. Or, for that matter, any atmosphere. < br / > < br / > I It is sort of quietly sinister, but it's not like the traditional horror film.",1
"She meets several strange neighbors, and even attends a birthday party for a cat. Whoa! Her boyfriend ( a slimy lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon ) starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem, not by a long shot. Then who are all these weirdos? Not a bad little horror flick, maybe good companion piece to "" Burnt Offerings "".",1
I think not. The end scene is repulsive and yet chilling.,1
"Sigh I sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such a grudge against director Michael Winner? And why? Just because certain prudish and easily offended people, who shouldn't watch the movie in the first place, claim it's an unethical thing to do? Pretty much the exact same controversy caused Todd's Browning's masterpiece and landmark in horror cinema "" Freaks "" to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years! Surely he isn't the avatar of subtlety, as his films are practically always hard - handed and confronting, but so what? They're awesomely entertaining.",1
"And AVOID the Goodtimes DVD at all costs. It sucks. I had to do a double - take when I didn't quite place where I'd seen him before. It seems Alison's troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the Vatican to become next sentinel. < br / > < br / > An excellent, creepy 70s classic from director Michael Winner that shouldn't be missed.",1
Alison Parker is a model with some fame. I think it is very scary as very few movies actually are.,1
"If you have time, check this one out. Pay close attention.",1
"I have read the book and I must say that this movie stays true to form. Also there is Beverly D'Angelo, who is underrated but great.",1
"If you loved "" Evil Dead 2 "", "" Dead Alive "" and "" Deep Rising "" - this will be your queen of favourites. Thankfully, "" The Sentinel "" BLEW ME AWAY! It is now one of favourites of all time. Do yourself a favour and check it out!",1
"Yesterday I saw this movie once more. Alison realizes that she is living in the gateway to hell. My vote is nine. Then, he invites Alison to his cat Jezebel's birthday party in the night. The cast is a constellation of stars and starlets. Since then, she left Christ and the Catholic Church behind. On the next day, weird things happen with Alison in her apartment and with her health.",1
"< br / > < br / > 9 / 10. The second beginning'as it's title explains, shows us the beginning of the end for the human race. < br / > < br / > The use of robots or artificial intellegence as slaves or servents is common among science fiction / fantasy stories.",1
"In fact, "" God "" is never really referenced by these shorts, instead replaced by "" Man's own image "". ), but they're informative even if they have a few gaps.",1
Is a bad thing?,1
"Well represented and put together, this a true testament to how illogical humans can be. Say no more, because this part of the story covered most of the bases.",1
"it's an obvious and obscene image designed to present human fear towards uncontrolled elements and aggression towards groups based on the actions of individuals. one robot, however, rebels and kills his owner, stating at his subsequent trial that he simply did not want to die. and thus the populace has become lazy and derogatory towards them. it lays on the ground, clothes and skin torn and breasts hanging out. there, the machines regroup and begin to produce new AI and to manufacture mass technology and trade it with human nations.",1
If you're going to accept whatever faith you subscribe to you can certainly accept a movie.,1
"As we move down the tracks, the voice of the Narrator ( Max von Sydow ) counts us down into a deep sleep, until we awake in Europa. Much like his first film The Element of Crime, von Trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world, and much like Element, the film begins with the main character ( or in the case of Europa, we the audience ) being hypnotized.",1
"I'd say it does a great job of that. The voice acting is very good, if there is not a lot of it. Thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like. This has several bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals, as well as a little nudity.",1
Japan makes some of the best animation in the world. The governments of the world order to dismantle machines. Sadly most of these shorts are disappointing. The short also has some religious themes and religious iconography. It tells how humans made machines in their own likeness.,1
"This is the perfect method to reveal the history. < br / > < br / > A couple problems. Could have been told little better, but still a solid 7 of 10. Plus it needs to be seen with part two to be complete. * * Warning!",1
"Do try and watch this movie even if you're not a horror puff, IMO it's definitely worth it!",1
"Also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Both as an extra and with Eddie Surkin on special effects.",1
"< br / > < br / > An absolute diamond, a film i still have on video to this day. Check it out.",1
"As the prisoners are put to work fixing the place up, they're instructed to break into the old execution room. It's nasty, gruesome, and good fun for a horror fan. < br / > < br / > 8 / 10",1
"And boy, are we treated to some awesome death scenes! which has been reopened. Or at least that's what you'd have thought. < br / > < br / > The film, in short, centres on an old prison ( well, duh! ) PRISON is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and it's somewhat of a shame that it isn't as well known as it should be. But the prison in this film is a different beast altogether. The characters themselves however lack three - dimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical.",1
However I didn't expect a ghost story more along the lines of Exorcist III.,1
"We focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years. The murders themselves are rather good and imaginative, however, and provide some major highlights. The film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting.",1
"< br / > < br / > Is The Golden Child a product of its time?, by that i mean, was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences?. Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. 7 / 10 When the beautiful Kee Nang { Charlotte Lewis } enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child.",1
"Overall, this is recommended. budget, it's hardly noticeable at all.",1
"The film has a tense, taut pace and Harlin knows how to build his scenes. I sat down and watched, and lo! It looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners. Chelsea Field is okay as the female lead. Viggo Mortenson as a very different prisoner being solid. Prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box.",1
"It seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived. The story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding. Haunting!! So... could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated??? """,1
"Few Brits will be upset by Barry's frequently cruel observations on his hosts. I was just starting to like the poms. "" I was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times.",1
"The Adventures Of Barry McKenzie'started life as a satirical comic strip in'Private Eye ', written by Barry Humphries and based on an idea by Peter Cook. There is some good news for our hero though ; he meets up with other Aussies in Earls Court, and Fosters is on sale in British pubs. A crafty taxi driver ( Bernard Spear ) maximises the fare by taking Bazza and Edna first to Stonehenge, then Scotland. Pom - hating Bazza is told by a Sydney solicitor that in order to inherit a share in his father's will he must go to England to absorb British culture. With Aunt Edna in tow, he catches a Quantas flight to Hong Kong, and then on to London. In 1972, he found his way to the big screen for the first of two outings. "". As he puts it : "" when it comes to fleecing you, the Poms have got the edge on the gyppos!",1
"Top notch. Definitely my two favourite films of all time, I watch them at least once a fortnight.",1
"Aussies and Poms will understand, everyone else - well? I love this movie like no other. Mum does most of the solid yacca ( ie hard work ) round our place. ( Barry's response ) Abos?",1
"One such scene is where the Golden Child, that Murphy's character is solicited to protect, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. An elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested on his choice. It has some pretty good special effects, and exciting action scenes.",1
Americans - - forget it. A hit at the time but now better categorised as an Australian cult film.,1
David is the best.,1
"David was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. This movie also had a wounderfull score.",1
Well worth look.,1
And it is a role he plays well.,1
"Angelina Jolie was also really good. He postures, he tries to be slick, he poses, he tries to be macho. In the end he just tries too hard. 7 / 10.",1
Very unfair to say the least. She puts in a solid performance. David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film.,1
I love this film.,1
Great cast all together.,1
"Hutton, Jolie, and DUCHOVNY? I gave it 8 stars.",1
"I can't think of a single one of Hollywood's "" former waiters "" who could have pulled the role off that well. Who's dying? < br / > < br / > Fortunately, Blaise baddies always die, in the end ( no spoilers there! )",1
A welcome change from the travesty of the Monica Vitti portrayal of Modesty.,1
I'm looking forward to next film. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice.,1
I was pleased to see that she had black hair! Has he actually read the books?,1
almost boring unreal. < br / > < br / > What I got was a movie not based on action or violence. The acting could have been improved too.,1
"< br / > < br / > As for the production values ( and I am no student of cinematography! ) I for one cannot wait to see the next production in this series by these producers - as long as they keep to the core values and characterisations of original stories! : yes, the film was filmed on a tight financial and time budget and maybe that shows... but does it spoil the viewer's enjoyment? For me they were totally credible. In this case I think not. Instead we are introduced to one of the world's greatest literary heroines and given a taste of her capabilities.",1
Modesty's history as a child is shown and is very true to the original.,1
Other reviewers have pointed out Staden's inadequacies as Modesty Blaise. Staden appears to be doing same here.,1
< br / > < br > Nine stars. Viva Nepal!,1
"Recap : It's business as usual at Louche's casino in Tanger. But, I felt it was a much better way to introduce a character than many other have done. Suddenly a troop of armed gangsters storm the casino, shooting wildly.",1
And I don't want a refund! This was the Modesty that we didn't know!,1
"All things considered, worth 8 stars.",1
Sadly.,1
can't wait for a follow - up... It's like a good pilot for a TV - series. The best Modesty Blaise movie I have seen so far. So I may have overrate this movie just a little.,1
"I guess wrong. See and vote. The bad boy is pretty too. Very impressing. Action fused with a fantastic story. Well, actually this whole movie is rare in'movieworld '.",1
"Sadly, this is also, where a major drawback of the movie is revealed.",1
"It doesn't matter. The result was "" My Name is Modesty, "" a small direct - to - video movie that introduces the character. There's a great deal of material from the Modesty Blaise comics and novels that would be great in a movie. With the movie rights close to expiration, they decided to try a very different approach. These characters are important to Blaise's adventures throughout most of the published stories. The film does not come across as cheap. What this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself.",1
"Totally awesome! They hunt for food, and he teaches her to read and fight. If she wins two times in a row, one of the staff members goes free.",1
"It is not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the real tale.",1
It truly is great fun. His sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero.,1
A terrific find by whoever cast her!,1
Alexandra did a great job in playing how O'Donnell's character would have taken control of the situation. < br / > < br / > I loved it when I first saw it and I love it still.,1
"That was camp. This is the real Modesty Blaise. She is very slim, graceful and poised. I really don't think there's a "" perfect actress "" for Modesty. To that end, I really hope the film does well in Europe. Alexandra Staden is credible. Having read all the books, I enjoyed the movie even more for that. She has lots of closeups.",1
"She is able to divert his raping her with just a shove and spitting out "" stop wasting my time! "" I just hope they do better on that if when they make sequels. What we have here is a step or two better than that.",1
"< br / > < br / > I assume, then, that you never heard of "" Topper "".",1
"I vaguely remember the theme song. The performances were top - grade, too. Also, I don't think I've seen every episode.",1
The interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen. No such scenes are present or needed. This movie is definately one of my favorite movies in it's kind.,1
And it is certainly the man himself we hear. It is also very stylish. Also One of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses. ( So the French language version is highly recommended ).,1
"Now everything that does happen feels too spontaneous, but the climax payoff is haunting. 'ending that might just make you jump. Top drawers Delon ( who's quite steely ) and Bronson ( a jovial turn ) Oh fun!",1
No such scenes are present or needed. This movie is definately one of my favourite movies in it's kind. The interaction between respectable and morally uncorruptable characters is an ode to chivalry and the honour code amongst thieves and policemen.,1
"My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take ride. I don't understand the pervading lack of'love'for its efforts, at all. There's nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends. Whenever I see most reviews it's called'a misfire for Eddie Murphy '.",1

"< br / > < br / > FAREWELL, FRIEND HAS BEEN RELEASED IN THE UK ; AN ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16. Losing Algiers was a bitter blow. Their motivation is quite different, their goals are different - their survival depends entirely on each other.",1

"appears as a bearded painter. The free love'philosophy isn't quite out of the system and Nora didn't count on falling in love, particularly with a junkie.",1
A classic Australian Story! Who knew she hid this talent? This movie will give you an entirely new impression of her.,1
"Put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great "" Grand Illusion "" and "" Rules of the Game. """,1
"The story is based on true events and that helps the movie. If this doesn't bring a tear to your eye, nothing will! For the first half of the movie the little girl grated on my nerves. I don't think this is one of her best acting jobs.",1
No matter this!,1
7 / 10 There is intense scene or two in this.,1
Great cast and an overall great movie.,1
"A warm, touching movie that has a fantasy - like quality. She is a miracle of God's creation.",1
!,1
"It is clean, wholesome, heartbreaking and heartwarming. < br / > < br / > All in all, a 10 out of 10. There are no downsides to this sweet human story.",1
What a lovely heart warming television movie. Which all viewers hope will materialise.,1
"I loved this movie. Everyone who rented it loved it! ). I totally disagree with some ( negative ) critiques that I've read over the years. ( YES, I did buy this film for my own video library!",1
"do watch it, you'll be glad you did.",1
In fact the only extra I think the DVD was missing was a pair of new pants. I caught this on ( a surprisingly feature - filled ) DVD and it scared me silly.,1
The special effects were very good. This is easily one of my favorite's. This is the way a proper horror movie should be. The spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood.,1
I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Laurence's future projects. It will keep you completely off balance.,1
"I just watched this movie and have to say, I was very impressed.",1
"It's creepy, tense and very very jumpy!",1
They aren't all that important anyways. Dark Remains is a home run plain and simple.,1
"This movie is creepy, and is very well done. He's trying to give her more direction.",1
"This is, very simply expressed, the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison, in this movie. Now, in our usual world of perception, it is common that objects change signs. Mrs. Christian is not a light, but a sun. First, nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly. ex., if someone grows a bird, his photograph will show him with beard, not without, as it did before.",1
Lots of fun.,1
It is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie.,1
I give it two thumbs up! This movie was very good.,1
"It offers some genuine scares and plenty of tension. Dark Remains "" is a pretty decent indie horror flick. 7 out of 10.",1
"I know, I know... she's just gone through a traumatic experience. For one thing, she's totally unsympathetic. This is not a movie to watch while you're eating pizza. There's not much new here... it's just done well. I think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her, but I never did.",1
Dark Remains is one of the good ones. Check this film out!,1
"Well worth rental. Doesn't rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its "" gotcha "" moments. Even if you've seen everything, there's still a few things in this film that will make your jaw drop.",1
< br / > < br / > The editing and visual fx are also top notch. The story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares. < br / > < br / > We managed to catch a screening of this film at Shriekfest 2005.,1
"I mean right now too! Of course ; as always, Mary - Kate and Ashley are the main scenery here anyway! "". Would any true fan want it any other way? Of course not!",1
"That In fact, that's not really the target audience. < br / > < br / > That said, those who ARE fans of the Olsen twins will really enjoy themselves. If that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on motorbikes, so be it. I enjoyed myself. "" as well as providing good, clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family.",1
Her bisexual nature ( allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with German Guy No. I thought this was a splendid showcase for Mandy's bodacious bod.,1
"Her face is huge in the back and Leo's is in the foreground. It brings up the snickers I got from his role in the Kingdom ( Riget. ) I have never seen anything like that in a film. < br / > < br Yet some people, like Leo, are tuned in, but don'thing positive about it. It shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them. Ernst - Hugo Järegård is great as Leo's uncle.",1
"We are contradictory and hypocritical, and I am ashamed for this. This might contain a spoiler, so beware. God Help us for what we have done. No one is above the law.",1
"The weaving of this footage with the interviews, and the islanders music, really heightens film's impact. Recommended. < br / > < br / > It is not easy viewing, but "" Stealing a Nation "" is John Pilger at his best.",1
We suck. The endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me.,1
"Nevertheless, the governments of Great Britain and the United States have thus far made no commitment to return the islands to what the courts have definitively concluded are the rightful inhabitants. To be silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime. Instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population.",1
"This is engine which drives the story, right or wrong, and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end. It is breathtaking, a master class in artistic control.",1
I will tell you. It always comes down to race. Pay no attention to the racist. This is a very good movie.,1
My wife and me gave 8 / 10. There are many plots and turns.,1
Excellent cast in this film! This was an excellent film! This is a great film and should be seen.,1
Quite ridiculous in fact. It is not a simple task as he quickly finds out. His job is to attend to the needs of the passengers. < br / > < br / > He depicts postwar Germany as a nightmarish train journey. The bomb scene described above really put me off. When the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles.,1
I gave it 7 of 10.,1
"Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee, and the Late Lynne Thigpen co - star in this very intense dramatic thriller.",1
In end this one makes for a rather good suspense / thriller.,1
He confesses. But the film has a sequel. One person in the local Public Attorney Offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges. To charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice. To fight against the death penalty is a just cause.,1
I completely disagree. I thought casting was perfect. This movie is filled with top stars and I highly recommend it! !,1
"The cast uniformly turns in some good performances. He's sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl. < br / > < br / > Of course the reverse is equally true. < br / > < br / > Criminal justice is not an end, but a process and a never ending one at that for all society. I guess if Just Cause has moral that would probably be it. Blair Underwood's grandmother Ruby Dee buttonholes Connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson's appeal. Many a confirmed liberal I've known has come out thinking quite differently once they've become a crime victim. < br / > < br / > Later on after Connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence he's uncovered, he's feeling pretty good about himself.",1
Whom he immensely detests. Now Sullivan is executed to his death. A Compelling Thriller! Bobby Earl gets a re - trial.,1
It's too bad he decided handheld cameras were wave of the future. Zentropa is the most original movie I've seen in years.,1
"I feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it. < br / > < br / > Maybe Sean Connery was miscast in his role. He's truly chilling and acting superbly. This movie really is a mixed bag. His performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie. Still I regard "" Just Cause "" as an above average thriller simply because of the fine cast.",1
"She old woman is convincing enough for Armstrong to take a look at the case. He is also convinced of the young man's innocence. < br / > < br / > Then, the scene changes. Ed Harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Arne Glimcher directed.",1
< br / > < br / > Christopher Reeve does a good job as being an ex - con / drifter.,1
Who cares? I judge it for what it is. < br / > < br / > This TV movie was charming. Books and films are different media.,1
Everything went on so matter of fact. I found this movie to be charming. She hires him.,1
A bona fide low budget classic. I love this film.,1
I have always treasure this film.,1
"Still, these characters weave a very interesting web together. Darla is a genuinely loveable ( or loathable ) character, depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior. "" Magda is a prostitute, the character i liked the best. Mark my words! Its a wonderful film and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie / art house crowd.",1
"It is not for mass consumption ( and that is not a compliment ). The message is a somewhat stylized post - college, neophyte view of society.",1
"For fans of Fight Club and any Charlie Kaufman film, and required viewing for anyone who avoids multiplexes like a rabi dog.",1
"This film is as good as it is difficult to find. 'Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!",1
"< br / > < br / > Hopefully soon. This film had cult classic written all over it, and I'm surprised it's not yet out on DVD.",1
It's also one of my top 10 favorite films. The film is five years old and rings more true every day.,1
"Perhaps they used real bikers, instead of actors. I found the music a real treat.",1
"Director Tom Laughlin ( yep, the same dude who portrayed Billy Jack! ) Stanton Fox's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings - on. Robert O. Ragland's funky score hits the gnarly spot. A total trashy treat.",1
"Leads Wymer and George E. Carey sell the May / December romance believably. This familiar story of an older man / younger woman is surprisingly hard - edged. 3, which is available from Amazon. Patricia Wymer, where are you?",1
"were more distractions than anything else. Let's Bowl "" started out on local television in the Twin Cities. The constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters ( Ernie, the Pig, Butch, etc. ) - - an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better. Sedahl played it straight, counter - balanced by Rich Kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious "" Wally Hotvedt. "" Hilarious!",1
"Besides his birthday coming up, nothing else looks promising. Preston Waters is off to a bad summer. He makes Leaving the bank, a bully steals the check. It's blank. His father confines him to his room for the rest of the evening.",1
The acting was good and bad. I hated and loved it at same time. Plus this movie isn't based on reality. I mean how whacked out is this. But also it sucks. Back to the story.,1
In this movie we can see how good Von Trier's handles film as a technical medium. The movie is also full of cynical ( even humorous ) undertones about the role of the Germans and Americans in post - war Germany. Mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to ( self - ) destruction. Of course the Dogme - films acted only as a vehicle for this theory ( besides creating some welcome spotlight on Von Trier ). ( These elements were also very omnipresent in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark. ),1
"Yeah, I remember this one! The story was entirely surreal, but nonetheless great! Brian Bonsall is a smart actor anyway. Many years since I actually watched it.",1

"One is enough for any man. In fact, no other book has affected me so much.",1
Yet it's extremely relevant to society and everybody. But ultimately it is a very beautiful and deeply moving film.,1
"Then Tisserand will become some kind of prey : all his pessimism will rub off on this poor man. The story takes place, now in Paris, now in Rouen, Guy de Maupassant's town. Absolutely none. < br / > < br / > This depressing movie is only suitable for an informed audience.",1
Tell them to get their own! ) ( This DVD justifies selfishness!,1
But these are failings of the movie but conscious choices.,1
Very enjoyable movie.,1
"It was through a high end Arcam system, it sounded great with dts. It does not matter what type of music you like, this one will definitely grow on you. ! It's the sheer brilliance of their performance that will make you watch it again and again. Even new musicians don't cut mustard these days, as these old rockers do.",1
"Ginger Baker, enough said. I've loved all of Cream's work, even as there is such a small and precious catalog of work to take hold. The renditions of White Room, Badge, Politician, Spoonful, Sunshine of Your Love, not one seems to miss a beat. Clapton's solos have a formation that he sometimes doesn't have when on stage with his solo band.",1
Jack Bruce just great. This concert is just shear brilliance from start to finish. Not so here.,1
The concert sounded very good. They surprised me.,1
Steven Ford was very likable. No.,1
and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one.,1
"An unusually straight - faced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously. Small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along, which is rare enough ( as I was reminded as I tried to sit through an Albert Pyun monstrosity called "" Heatseeker "" the other night - - this low - budget stuff isn't as easy as it looks - - but that's another story! )",1
"But, for once a TV movie caught my interest. More importantly Helen Hunt caught my eye. I would now see myself as a huge fan. Give it a chance, it won't let you down. This movie comes with high marks from... me. I really wasn't big fan of hers prior to this film. Sure I liked Twister and As Good As It Gets.",1

Officer Palusky is given the task to go undercover to get close to murder suspect Kayle Timler, Steven Webber. * * SPOILERS * * Highly charge police drama about a serial killer loose in and around the small town of Riverside Wisconsin.",1
What a scene! ! When she talks about her mother!,1
Gina was a complex character. This movie was a good example of doing a lot with little. < br / > < br / > The entire movie was spectacular.,1

"I just finished viewing this finely conceived, and beautifully acted / directed movie. So why did I watch it? I gave it a 9. Reading the earlier comments persuaded me to give it a shot.",1
One of the better movies released.,1
The style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along. The style is very sixties Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. Check out if you can. Space Cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch. Space Cobra himself is witty and likable.,1
This film is a great fun. But I don't want to give anything away. They deserved winning the best documentary. Just drag your friends over to see this and don't tell them a thing.,1
He simply is the Bergman or Fellini of our time. And It is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this. I tend to agree with him. This is the fifth von Trier film I have seen.,1
"Interview footage with those who know / knew her ( including an ex husband, her publisher, and others ) tell their side of the story. It, like Irving's biography on Hughes was revealed as a potential hoax. This is a toothsome, well produced documentary that manages to point many fingers at just as many potential guilty parties. Not a good choice for little ones.",1
"The apparent con unfolded in the Australian State of Queensland via very personal swindles of Khouri's friends and fans (! ). Beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature. < br / > < br / > Cleverly edited and colourful, Broinowski's storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of Norma Khouri meaningfully blowing smoke. On a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired..... so I watched it twice.",1
What a patient woman! What a fascinating film. I loved this movie.,1
celebrity? It's almost impossible to imagine what Ms. Khouri hoped to gain by appearing in this film : vindication?,1
"She sounds completely believable, convincing. < br / > < br / > One of the most exciting feature films at the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. < br / > < br / > Khouri comes back and denies the accusations, taking a successful lie - detector test in the process. < br / > < br / > What is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this "" exposure "" of Khouri is made with Khouri's full participation. Brilliant.",1
"As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. < br She refuses to return to Jordan and show us the facts. Norma fears for her life, worried about violent backlash over the unsavoury portrait her novel paints of Jordanian Muslims. Broinowski is not deterred however, and slowly puts pieces together in front of us. I like documentaries, but often find them dragging with about 25 minutes to go. A few years later though, a few journalists started poking holes in the story, leading the public to believe it was fraud. The web of lies, truths and half - truths she turns through the film is brilliant.",1
"No. It was made in Brazil, so I assumed that was why it hadn't made it to video yet. Before they dispatch him, though, they make him part of their tribe ( their custom ). A white man is mistaken by a savage tribe of cannibals as their enemy, so they intend to kill him.",1

"In order to celebrate the victory, the Indians decide to eat him. The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix. The screenplay is very original and the story is spoken in Tupi. My vote is eight.",1

"The film is not really realistic, I mean, isn't it easier to adopt? Does it hurt to attempt some originality, Abbas? She just should do more such roles. Come on, it's cheesy and unrealistic. Watch it for Preity. Why? Mustan? < br / > < br / > 7 / 10 for film! < br / > < br / > Salman acts very well. Have you heard of insemination? The cinematography was unfortunately bad.",1
Preity Zinta is picture perfect. Otherwise the whole family sequence felt overdone in the beginning. Rani Mukherjee was adequate. The songs are pretty nice. There are some very little plot holes. Otherwise the movie is definitely worth a watch.,1
The main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled. The only information given was that it was a suspense thriller. Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai nothing stood out. I say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer! Abbas Mastan has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactfully..,1
Raj finds a girl. The film is going to be a huge hit because of the three main stars. Her name is Madhubala ( Preity Zinta ). They go to Switzerland to do this so no one finds out. She is a dancer and a prostitute. I was right. Rani and Preity are wonderful. What happens next? Raj changes Madhubala completley. Raj and Priya decide to go for surrogacy.,1

"Anne was so right for the role of the chatty, heartwarming orphan. Gertrude Messinger, who had also been in films as a small child was fine as Diana Barry. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her stage name. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe.",1
Von Trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen.,1
"As in the book, Anne is bright and quick, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her build, her freckles, and her long red hair. The actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood's all - time beauties and the film is in black and white. Which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy.",1

"Sexuality is a big theme within the movie, which gets handled delicately and subtle. < br / > < br / > A good movie on its subject. The film premiered at Cannes in 2007 and actually won some awards there as well. The movie is certainly a good watch, that handles its subject well and tells its story steadily and therefore also effectively, in a typical somewhat slow French cinematic pace. It's a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie, due to its subject and visual approach.",1
"The shy, retiring Marie is slim and petite and appears to be the youngest of the three. Anne is something of a plain Jane, Floriane a glamorous blonde who is very popular with the boys. The film reverses some conventional stereotypes about sexuality.",1
< br / > < br / > Bon cinéma! Not everything is said in this excellent first feature from Céline Sciamma. The soundtrack is A + by the way.,1
"It is no different for boys. In it she finds an apple, mostly eaten. Soon they will walk together. The English title is "" Water Lilies "".",1

The camera works beautifully also. The music is perfect and the acting is amazing.,1
"the musical score is very good. the story DOESN'T make sense. the day time ended "" is an incredible picture.",1

The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least. He has never been a very interesting film actor. I don't understand why the other comments focus on McConaughey.,1

I've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini - series, "" Planet Earth, "" narrated by my childhood idol David Attenborough.",1
The camera techniques are varied and spot on from close ups to aerial work. Eventually it all gets a bit bitty and disjointed.,1

Great film with great acting and fantastic photography in NYC!,1
But it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect. Certainly one that I encourage you to see.,1

"Danny Aiello as a burrough political chief, is also very good. I love showtunes, too. CITY HALL is a somewhat mixed bag. It comes off more like a documentary, than a motion picture.",1
"There are much more comedy in this, good one, though. It's an odd story and setting. They are all very good. Also be prepared to see some more. This series don't seem to be quite as serious as the first one. The non - digital effects looks good too. Thought it was unoriginal and didn't fit.",1
Here the story became implausible.,1
< br / > < br / > And the power behind power. < br / > < br / > As New York Mayor John Pappas in City Hall.,1
The man is acting royalty. In City Hall Pacino plays the New York City mayor. Its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by Pacino. The film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city. < br / > < br / > I absolutely hate talking about Al Pacino.,1
"And what was to happen happens and a few people, including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that criminal. We are not speaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest. The film concerns a classic theme.

"Little by little, the deputy mayor comes to grasp that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it outclasses he law. Individual idiosyncrasies are also explored, including Aiello's emotional bond with the music of Rogers and Hammerstein. As Cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mobster's probation report, his skepticism is agitated. How and why these people are affiliated I leave to the movie to divulge, though there are never any misgivings that they are. How did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence? Much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations.",1
This one richly deserves! I don't award many tens. Pacino is an American Olivier. There is murder.,1
"In that movie, their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense. The thing is, the public knows that something is wrong, for sure! It requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer. I would compare it to'All The President's Men'in terms of generic subject matter. I read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred, went ahead and started watching. but following details is hard to do. I watched it 3 times in a row! What a nice change.",1
A great vehicle for Cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic. It just so happens to open in New York.,1
David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. The ending didn't have a lot of sting. This was one of the few problems with the film. Danny Aiello was superb as always.,1
"Like the first, this also brings up some loaded ethical questions. The pacing isn't as sharp as in the first part, and I found myself less gripped by this one. Both qualities show in this. The characters are developed further. The strong graphic material of the first also returns, and it's been kicked up a notch.",1
"Excellent political thriller, played much quieter and slower than other, higher ranking films in this genre. A story of friendships, father - son relationships, corruption and deceit.",1
I've seen this movie about 6 times now.,1
"No one watches anyone else whenever he's on. < br / > < br / > No surprise because the script was co - authored by Nicholas Pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories. The story mushrooms and at the end it's reached inside City Hall itself. He's very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them, do Aiello in. He knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film.",1
"The plot is cleverly crafted, story is believable.",1
And there is good acting here.,1
This movie is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own. The workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and couldn't believe it.,1
Documentaries of this kind are often very opinionated.,1
< br / > < br / > I wish everyone could see it. This film however was mesmerizing.,1
Need to see more documentaries like this. < br / > < br / > Outstanding and highly recommended.,1
"Wow! Here, the film comes full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film is never preachy, is not guilt driven, and allows everyone's point of view to be present. They play with toys, jump rope, and dance.",1
But you never know!,1
The film is much more than a commentary on globalization.,1
It is simply amazing.,1
The girls'bleak lives are shown in stark contrast to the bizarre excesses of Mardi Gras itself.,1
"The young women workers in China have various points of view, and owner is amazingly open about the discipline. Bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film!",1
"The man in charge of the movie ( the narrator if you will ) does depict movies here in his own way. More like psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho does sound better as a header. It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's a only a brief snippet not big of a deal anyways. < br / > < br / > Or in other words, he might spoil them for you.",1

"Just don't expect to see something outbreaking. Again, it's way over top and I believe not to be a completely waste of time for I do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood.

Congrats.",1

"And talk he did, and how. Well? He stands in front of us and calls himself a pervert. He says that the perverse nature of cinema is to teach us to desire certain objects, not to provide us with them. Come on, you could have guessed by now : he's one of the leading philosophers of our age. He's unpredictable and scary.",1
This film will keep you guessing right to very END!,1

"It is also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene is long just some seconds. It begin with a courius wedding of the two protagonists where their love - story is reported. I am right now in front of the tv, watching Casomai. It is changing, it id evolving or better... devolving. It is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this movie.",1
The screenplay is wonderful. < br / > < br / > Who likes contract marriage? The real role of families : they can help or they can destroy us.,1
This film was a relative blockbuster by domestic Italian standards.,1

5 out of 1o stars. Overall the film is OK. Beautiful.,1
"That they don't is also testament to the astounding performances given by the leading non - actors, Sharifah Aryana and Mohd Syafie Naswip. That is what Malaysian filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad aims to prove in her fourth feature, a movie where that most complex of emotions is recounted in a deceptively simple, straightforward fashion. But what does this mean? Are they just friends, or is something more implied, something neither of them is yet ready to understand, let alone accept?",1
"The movie starts off in a classroom setting where not surprisingly, our main actress, Orked was seen in a Chinese Language class. The different character was portrayed with eagerness and mild humor. Later in the film, she was asked on why ( by Mukhsin ) that she was sent to learn Mandarin.",1

Ha ha. Its not just about entertainment. Its really ironic how the characters relate. Its crude yet awakeningly fresh.,1
"Grade A < br / > < br / > 2nd Story. ( "" Waxworks "" ). This is the Best story here, as it's extremely creepy, and unpredictable throughout, it also has a nice twist as well!. Christopher Lee did an amazing job, and Chloe Franks did a wonderful job as the young daughter, plus ending is quite shocking!. I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's one of the best horror stories i have seen!.",1
"! If you love creepy, horrible and mysterious films, with lots of surprises, this is FILM FOR YOU!!!",1
Minor quibbles aside this movie and it's wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can. Someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead we're given a woman with a jaw of a turtle.,1
"In general, however, this is a solid, spooky little movie.",1
"At that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become. And these things don't happen in the open. Possible too. TB was real too. We're not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life. All that happened later on? People were poor, illiterate, and worked in small farms. A kid knowing that his mate's dad is in fascist squad that killed his dad?",1
"For true fans of classic horror. This is for you. Now people strain just to think of new ideas. < br / > < br / > Anyway, to the movie.",1
An excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything.,1
"The idea in this tale isn't exactly originalbut it's very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising. The second story stars ( Hammer ) horror - legend Peter Cushing as a retired stockbroker. High expectations are allowed for this film, since it was entirely written by Robert Bloch! It's a terrific warm - up for what is arguably the BEST story : number 3.",1
"With the creepiest outright plot and the biggest twist of the stories, this is a quite pleasant entry. The classic moment is the kill in psychiatrist's office, which is an all - time high for creepiness. The atmosphere here is what sets it apart. Ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from Jane's past, which John vehemently denies. The House That Dripped Blood "" is one of the better anthology films of the time period.",1
"Brilliant cinematography. Some haunting moments and images. Aside from the'The Cloak,'the rest of the stories feel like they've been done before. I can't tell you how many times I rented this film during my childhood, but I did because there was something about it. Clichés galore. Moves at a slow, but stead pace. Plenty good old fashioned thrills and chills, especially in the first and last vignettes.",1
"The first segment is a great kickoff to the film. The tale is delightfully weird, and the second - best of the film, after the third. In four parts, the film tells the tales of four different heirs. John Reed ( Christopher Lee ) moves in with his little daughter. The story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are entirelly very good.",1
"Plot contrivance similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good movie, taken with a grain of salt. Good uncanny vibes. This segment also lacks the solidity of the first two.",1
RIP Peter. Death and the maiden.,1
< br / > < br / > The piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of sexual nature.,1
"< br / > < br / > The second, while not bad at all, is probably weakest. Though slow, this one ended very well. < br / > < br / > The fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre. So, for a change of scenery, they rent this house. Yes, this IS a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun!",1
"First and most mundane tale, "" Method for Murder "" - Successful author Charles Hillyer ( nicely played by Denholm Elliott ) is haunted by images of the murderous fiend he's writing about in his latest book. Highly recommended to fans of omnibus fright fare. No - nonsense Inspector Hollaway ( a solid turn by John Bennett ) investigates the disappearance of a famous thespian and uncovers the wicked past history of a creepy old house.",1
"The movie centers around a very old English country house and the misfortune that befalls all that dwell within. I'll admit to being biased when I reviewed this since it was my introduction to the series. She has a natural talent for it, with good reason. Oh and those horrible prop teeth ( then again these are British actors, maybe those were REAL!!! ) There is subtle physchedelia here via his torment that I found amusing yet creepy.",1
"It is rather good, but it could have used a bit more. All in all though it was an interesting set of stories. It has four stories all somewhat connected by a house. This movie is another horror anthology. The actor really gets what he paid for.",1
"Well come to find out... if she knew what Lee did, she would have certainly understood. There were nice Gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance. The two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye. This one ' I won't spoil it for you. < br / > < br / > Story three stars one of my very favorites... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid.",1
"Dominic may or may not be real, so director Peter Duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. < br / > < br / > "" Method of Murder "" is about a horror novelist ( Denholm Elliott ) who is menaced by one of his own creations, the creepy Dominic. This episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror.",1
"Production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget Duffell had to work with. That's all we need out of it, really. Though the linking device itself is not all that great, the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable. The latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and, frankly, it makes one regret the fact that he wished to distance himself from the genre ( though more so as not to be typecast rather than because he felt it was beneath him ).",1
"The "" dying "" moments are particularly horrific. Most effective in this episode is the dream sequence, although it's great as always to watch Cushing. This sequence has some good surreal and fairly suspenseful moments, and is capped by a reasonably amusing revelation and denouement.",1
"It wasn't quite as good as I was led to believe. My feelings for them today are just as strong. Although, that movie is very different from the others. < br / > < br / > The first story sees Denholm Elliott as a writer of crime stories. < br / > < br / > I spent many years trying to track down this movie.",1
Oh well. A very cool movie.,1
I absolutely love photography. The story is sweeping.,1
A very good and unusual movie score too. There's also a cute line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula.,1
"The key to this segment, as with the others, is the mystery surrounding the events that take place. < br / > < br / > One can only struggle to find the words to describe the true brilliance that is The House That Dripped Blood '. Elliott'performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability.",1
"Horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies. Inside, he discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess.",1
Go in expecting quality entertainment and you won't be disappointed. < br / > < br / > The symbolism of the opening credits and director's choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white filming all serve Shaw and the story well.,1

"The innocent have always had to suffer for the ambitions of the mighty. Why? Suddenly, the air pressure blew out the stoppage and the flames leaped up right on her.

They used gas jets in the movie, and 2 of them were stopped up. He is the English politico who is orchestrating the show. < br / > < br / > John Gielgud performed outstandingly.

Leslie Charteris'series of novels of the adventures of the slightly shady Simon Templar ( "" The Saint "" ) was brought to the screen in the late 1930s with the up and coming George Sanders as Templar.

"< br / > < br / > The narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in New York City once again. It all seems rather too pat. The details are given in an addendum that follows this review. Hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story. < br / > < br / > The story of the protest is told simply. While scenes in the present are color saturated, the 1943 scenes are washed out, strong on blue - gray tones.",1
"After Hannah's father died, her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox Jew even though she hasn't been very religious before. < br / > < br / > One of those movies is "" Rosenstrasse "". For as far as I know, there hasn't been another movie that deals with this subject. I'm always surprised about how many times you'll see something about World War 2 on the German national television.",1
"While Ms. von Trotta shows that the courage of a small number of Germans made a difference, she does not use it to excuse German society. In addition to the dramatization of historical events, the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the Holocaust by a German and the result of the child's experience of losing her mother. In Rosenstrasse, Margarethe von Trotta blends two stories to create a vibrant tapestry of love and courage. < br / > < br / > Standing together in the Lena, in a radiant performance by Reimann, discovers that her husband and other Jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the Rosenstrasse.",1
"This is very, very realistic. Those days were simply not discussed. Her apartment in New York City reflects affluence secured by her deceased spouse's labors. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiance, a non - Jew named Luis ( Fedja van Huet ). Berlin - born in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. Stay tuned. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families, in whole but usually in part, escaped the Holocaust.",1

Agnes Merlik directed with sure hand showing a visual style of her own. Artemisia, unfortunately couldn't go as far as she could have because of the prejudice against women in the arts. She was clearly influenced by the work of her father, by Caravaggio, Agostino Tassi, and other Florentine painters of that period. She is a gorgeous creature who awakened passion in men.

It actually has a point. This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen this year. Just a well put together movie!!!!,1
I saw a group of four mid - 60s women come in. This is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly. The poster is possibly the funniest I've ever seen for a movie. And they're funny. Carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally. I immediately bought one for my dorm this September.,1

"You don't want to miss the first few jokes, assuming you came to not miss any jokes. ! I have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending.",1
"I was very pleasantly surprised with this film. This film is just as good as this year's Wedding Crashers, and both films are two of best comedies I have seen in awhile. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year. It is sweet, funny, entertaining, fun, enjoyable, clever, good natured and a good time.",1
SPOILERS Sex huh? < br / > < br / > Carell is not alone however in his performance.,1
Andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology. Simply being excessively raunchy isn't enough anymore. As we all know the sub - genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded. Combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer. Andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. < br / > < br / > The main character Andy is ( unfortunately for me ) a person I can relate to. It's like my life story.,1

Not many. A wonderful performer. Does this mean female butt cannot be funny?,1
A true winner and an instant classic ; the funniest film of the year.,1
Only once in a while do we get an R - rated comedy that gets everyone's time and attention. The end couldn't have been better. I dare you to see this film and to not laugh. It's two hours of non - stop laughing. It's an even rarer case when the critics will like it. A man is forty years old and he is a virgin.,1
"I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald ; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. < br / > < br / > Strangely enough, despite the raunch, there's an admirable moral If I were to say, "" This movie is hilarious, go check it out!

My mom would've walked out during first scene. Honestly. I feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect.",1
"original, charming, and very funny. highly recommended. it had it's crude moments, but they were full of charm.",1
I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time.,1
"This is his first starring role, but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle. But by the end of the 40 Year Old Virgin, I think I found overall it was more satisfying than'Crashers '. Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well. As the title suggests, Andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little Pee - Wee Herman in him ( the opening over credits of his his apartment is hilarious, a good sign ).",1
"My girlfriend and I both loved it. Everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect. or small children. I laughed so hard I cried at some of the jokes. I got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know what to expect. What a great surprise. OK..... this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother ( Jack Palance? ) All of the characters have their flaws, but they also have depth and likability. I can't wait to get DVD.",1
"And so begins Andy's quest into adulthood. Without giving anything away, it reminded me of'Something About Mary '. I would highly recommend. Virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes.",1
I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. He has a style that I haven't seen before. He proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always.,1

"Most notable were the unforgettable titles. Barriers seems to be one of those series that have been lost in the mists of time. < br / > < br / > A fond memory from my childhood After it's transmission in the early 80s and one repeat, it's since sunk without trace. This is a crying shame. Although I don't remember a great deal about the program, a few things stuck in my mind.",1
"Oh well, I can't wait for the DVD. This sitcom had a feel of'Citizen Smith'about it.",1
I often wonder why this series was slammed so much. If it is ever issued I will certainly buy.,1

It'more for adults. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. This was true brilliance.,1
... here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm.,1
"Perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically. She always had a falling out with her men and she rejected them. I have watched this movie three times. How did she afford to buy such a house on meager earnings of her singing career? This pattern held with Harris and two husbands. Perhaps Lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail. None of this communication appeared on the film. Despite Ann's rejection of Harris, she continues to hold deep feelings for him on her deathbed. Ann's behavior seems totally inexplicable.",1
"The older Lila ( Meryl Streep ) visits Ann at the end and the secrets are revealed :'there are no such things as mistakes - life just goes on. For this viewer, seeing the film on a DVD in the quiet of the home, a very different reaction occurred.",1

< br / > < br / > The cinematography is excellent as expected. The backstory to this should have been developed more. Her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional resonance than the rest of the film. Claire Danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth. Their interplay is weak. I think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years. A bit too As a matter of fact as soon as he exits the story it starts to drag. Streep's performance actually is little more than a cameo.,1
"Nice girl. This irony is intended! The Danes character finally let's Buddy have the awful truth. "" Maybe there are few mistakes, after all.",1
"This is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her lifethe one that got away. < br / > < br / > It is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid. It's not as though Ann's life now is uninteresting, it just has less to do with the plot then it does with the morals being learned. No matter what happens, though, the film is not about these people and what they do, good or bad.",1
"Later the bride - to - be confesses her true feelings about Harris to Ann. Why motherhood is so important in the story? Which issues Ann Lord has resolved after visit of Lila Ross? Why Ann and Harris have not stayed together, if the guy really loved her like he confesses in their occasional encounter in New York? The locations, costumes, set decoration, cinematography and soundtrack are also awesome. My vote is seven.",1

"" Individual tunes are woven into a symphony.",1
"Nina finds a great deal of strength in her mother's mistake. I can't wait to see her act in something else in the future. She plays the black sheep of the family ; a little lost. The cast is glowing in Evening. Mamie Gummer, who plays Anne's youthful best friend, is wonderful.",1

"Carface will not even listen to the fat, ugly dog with the big glasses who happens to be closest to him. It was set in New Orleans in 1939. This movie isn't just for kids and it's far from ordinary.

"All Dogs Go To Heaven Is The Best Animated Movie Ever. Dogs Are So Cute As Little Mice. Oh, Yes.",1
"Most people that don't like anime that I've forced to watch this movie ( lol ), liked it. This OVA is kinda the opposite. So, I'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti - war story. This movie did a fantastic job of that.",1

Soon Carface shows up and captures Ann Marie. I love All Dogs Go to Heaven even though I'm a guy. Soon Charlie awakens and finds out that Ann Marie is gone! The next day Charlie Itchy and Ann Marie go to look for money!,1
I had forgotten about the movie for about 12 years. Which I Believe makes the movie from good to great.,1
"Don Bluth, thank you. All I've said are just only some of the good points of this movie.",1
This is definitely must see for people of all ages.,1
I love the songs in this movie. Those are beautiful songs. They are so cute.,1
"That depends on the kid. In this movie characters can DIE, and be sent to HELL! I saw this movie when I was 10, I absolutely loved it.",1
I'm unsure about how adults would react to it. I would highly recommend this film to children.,1
"In that picture he appeared quite dubious to his role of villain. I still love this movie even at the age of 22. Once back on Earth, Charlie goes about seeking revenge on the evil Carface. Now he must rescue her from dreaded Carface.",1
"Itchy is his sidekick. It is set during the prohibition in the United States. ). Five : The songs in this are lovely. Three : The Don Bluth animation ( as usual ) is superb. The backgrounds are good too. Charlie is half a gangster and half a goodie, which I like.",1
"< br / > < br / > Sometimes you have to lose to win. A neutral colony of Side 6 has been targeted by Cyclops, a Zeon task force. I would rate it more of a drama than action. UC 0079, the One Year War is almost at an end.",1
The movie is filled with fun songs and music.,1
"Set in New Orleans in the 1930s, the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable. I managed to track it down a few weeks ago, however, and was pleasantly surprised again.",1
"Recommended for the whole family. A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I just love that guy, ahehehe. But it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals.",1
"How could they not? Not to mention that it's just so cute and touching. Charlie takes the girl, Ann - Marie, and makes fake promises in order to get the money. 8, I thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well. I'm 22 years old and the ending still gets to me.",1
"This is good and your kids will probably like it. This isn't a bad movie like many say, it is a very good movie. All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie that I have always liked. When I was a kid, I used to watch this every other day.",1
"Yes, there are continuity glitches. It gets 10 simply because it made me feel. To my surprise, the movie held to my every expectations. It's a great movie.",1
I loved this film when I was little. Often very dark and frightening at times. But do keep a tissue in handy. Along with Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro. A treat for Don Bluth fans and animation buffs.,1
If only I could go back to those days. It's an amazing movie.,1
What a fun movie St. Ives is. In fact it isn't over anything.,1
"If you are uninitiated to the Gundam world, this is a good place to start.",1
"They fall in love, and most of the story concerns Flora helping Jacques to escape and to find his emigré grandfather, the old Comte. Cue treachery!",1
No Music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie. The fundamental difference is the Story and the Director. His stunt scenes are clearly outstanding.,1
This is movie is very touching. The direction is very good.,1
What a outstanding movie is this i have not words to describe. but i know the people has deferent chooses so ya.,1
"of three. ), married to Sumi ( Shefali Shah ) is a doting father to Aditya ( Akshay Kumar ). His love for Aditya though, results in his procrastination of the grave issue. In this'saga of Indian emotions'then, we have a happy family ( isn't it always? ) Writer Aatish Kapadia ( he also penned We've got it!",1
Simply great movie no doubt about it.,1
< br In the meanwhile he marries his ladylove Mitali ( Priyanka Chopra ). Aditya is still at his blithe best leading a carefree life. Ishwar's pampering has only spoil him all the more.,1
An excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman. Highly recommended.,1
). Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood seeking stardom.,1
"Great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. Thus all his actions become unescapably logical. Montand gives the concept of the'lone wolf'police detective a whole new dimension of intensity and, most importantly, credibility.",1
"When the latter learns it, he kills her in a fit of anger. But his superior knows that he usually works alone. < br / > Eventually, the chief idea of the film concerns Ferrot himself. In spite of drawbacks, Corneau and his scenarist Daniel Boulanger penned a deft story. He's a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization.",1
Series 2 has got off to a great start!,1
"This drama is unlike Sex and the City, where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other. Her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well. The ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between Richard and Trudi are totally funny! Its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be "" safe ""! Its much more personal and people can relate to it. She is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son's advances on her.",1
The chick can act.,1
"However, it can't think of a good way of putting the two Ah, I see. The series itself? Unwisely, she's now taken up with his son. Husband is infertile. < br / > < br / > Jessica is an experimental lesbian. Most of the characters are hell bent on cutting metaphorical chunks off themselves. It's not going to end well for Katie. Stop! What she actually does of course is say to her friends "" I have to tell my husband "".",1
Plus the male cast are not bad on eyes too. The stories the characters seem more real and you empathise with the situations more.,1
"See it, i recommend it to all young people. it's not about racism it'about how to live your life! Bless these people and make everyone happy!",1
Some of the movie was shot aboard the U. S. S. Belleau Wood. Fisher can't seem to avoid launching his own assaults at minimal provocation from his fellow enlisted men.,1
"But, Davies yearns to become a true drama queen.",1
He was the most precious little boy I had ever met. This is my favorite movie EVER. !,1
THE FILM IS GREAT!! !,1
"Also a great piece of casting was Joy Bryant as Fisher's girlfriend, Cheryl. Providing good support in a small role in Salli Richardson as Washington's wife Berta. However more importantly we wouldn't get to see the superb, we can only hope star making, turn from Derek Luke in the title role.",1
"< br / > < br / > And I wasn't. Black, white, purple or polka dotted. I didn't want to be disappointed. In any film. That is what makes good cinema.",1
"He is understatedly, and thoughtfully, portrayed by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, while obviously using his star power to have the film made, sticks to the background for the most part, and allows the film to be the Antwone Fisher story. That would be a sad commentary on race - relations in North America in and of itself. I can say that it is the best film I have seen all year. < br / > < br / > < br / > < br / > Antwone Fisher's story is one that should find resonance with any empathic individual.",1
I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away. ` Antwone Fisher'was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself. But what can you expect from the acting ` Master D'himself. Ok!,1
This movie was incredible.,1
"< br / > < br / > Do stereotypes of pimps, whores, drug dealers, single parent homes, and so forth constitute a "" Black Movie? "" That is to say, Denzel deserved awards for "" Malcolm X, "" "" Hurricane "" and others before that jive "" Training Day "" Oscar. That is not to negate or push aside other great actresses and actors of color who are denied their due praise for ingenious work. Viewers may go to this movie expecting a "" Black Movie : what is a "" Black Movie? """,1
"This, of course, is a tribute to the Director.",1
"Pop the corn, pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century movie making history. Enjoy!",1
... intimate and specific.,1
"Quite contrary! Undoubtedly, Denzel felt some kind of commitment and believed in the real life story of Antwone Fisher. What makes this film good is the fact that it's not overly melodramatic.",1
< br / > < br / > Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER. < br / > < br / > Get ready to shed a tear or two. The movie could thaw the coldest heart. The chemistry flowed well between the romantic characters. Priceless. He had a strong presence in this movie.,1
I just watched Antwone Fisher on BRAVO. Kleenex alert - - Feel good tearful.,1
"He is at first unwilling to talk, but when he begins, the floodgates are opened. Author and screenwriter Antwone Fisher joined the U. S. Navy to see new landscapes but the demons of his past prevented him from seeing the world through new eyes. It is a heartfelt if somewhat formulaic look at the painful process of moving from being consumed by one's past to being able to live life in present time. < br / > < br / > The only friend he has is a local by named Jesse ( Jascha Washington ) who, later in the film, only adds to his feelings of abandonment. According to Antwone, the treatment by his foster mother Mrs. Tate ( Novella Nelson ) who referred to him only as "" nigga "" and by his cousin Nadine ( Yolonda Ross ) was in fact much worse than shown on the screen.",1
"( The story is based on life of Antwone Fisher, born 3. So, it hits you hard, letting you know your not the only one going through hell.",1
One of most moving cinematic scenes I have seen. I defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie.,1
Whats more is that this is a true story.,1
"< br / > < br / > The DVD includes a French Language track, various subtitle choices, as well as additional features and information about foster parenting. Antwone Fisher's story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children. Even if some of the homes and administrators don't seem to care and appear self - serving, many do give it their all. No matter where you are from, you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem. < br / > < br / > As a Clevelander I appreciated the location footage. Abandoned by a troubled mother, Antwone has never met his father. < br / > < br / > The scene where Antwone meets his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film.",1
"It's really a terrific trip back time. The producer? ( Until a potential scandal forced him from the business ). The boy genius, Irving Thalberg.",1
It is very good.,1
"And his self - confidence and self affirmations to his mother and against the abusers of his past were so powerful. One died. < br / > < br / > I cried for almost a day after I saw this the first time. It even caused me to realize that I do have a "" missing piece "" and I am going to seek out my birthparents now. BUT another set of parents picked me up and loved me. And now I am a success! "" And it helped me to realize just how messed up our social system is. No matter if you are adopted or not, it is a heart - tugger that can't be ignored by anyone concerned about children in our society.",1
Antwone's past is revealed in detail. The film has a very professional look. He is not a < br / > < br / > The lead performances are very good indeed.,1
"My vote is eight. Resolving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man.",1
We all have a choice!,1
A stunning film of high quality. 10 out of 10. The story is in effect a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment. < br / > < br / > The real Antwone deserves success.,1
"An adaption of the book'Finding Fish '. < br / > < br / > If you like inspirational true stories, then watch Antwone Fisher.",1
"Why should you see Arthur? It was even featured in VH1's "" I Love the 80's. "" I know I do! "" Running time : 97 minutes. Classified PG. Especially when he delivers lines such as, "" Don't you wish you were me? Written and directed by Steve Gordon. Arthur Bach is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk, but you can't help but like him.",1
Now my whole family has it memorized. It will make you laugh for years to come. ! We quote it at least once a day. I still laugh after all this time. I absolutly love this movie. And I know it will do same for you! A lot of laughs.,1
"The jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is Davies outrageous southern costume. A treasure of film. Davies lands a job in slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. She meets fellow slapstick star William Haines, who is immediately smitten with her.",1
"The end is fairly corny, though. Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic. Worth seeing many times.",1
* * * from * * * *,1
< br / > < br / > What can I say? This is one of the most perfect films ever made.,1
"The end was happy for Linda and Arthur although the latter knew that his life will change in coming future. This comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone. Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he only enjoyed himself drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes. Rich people are not usually happy with their ways of life.",1
"Admittedly, Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice. It's the butler you'll remember best long after closing credits roll. This is one of my favorite comedies ever. The ladies of the piece are also well portrayed. Arthur proposes, but then unwisely falls for Linda, a waitress and petty thief.",1
"It's only sad that Steve Gordon passed away just a year after "" Arthur "" was released. < br / > < br / > The DVD has a few extras that are nice but it's just not enough. Quite simply, IMHO the movie is a rare gem.",1
Do yourself a favour and see this movie!,1
I don't know that actor. 'Arthur'is just fun. looking forward to watch the sequel.,1
"That is not way I wish to be remembered. "" Dudley Moore is charming, lovable and rich. ""... "" More than enough. """,1
"We have most lines memorized. Arthur is truly "" funny stuff ""!",1
"( I know that doesn't make much sense, but that's what happened. ) I'm a huge classic film buff, but am just getting in to silent movies.",1
"It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable. I remember watching the out - takes regarding the bit with the moose. < br / > < br / > The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to this. His demeanor, his one - liners and the way he handled Arthur were all equally hilarious. They were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it.",1
"Moore's clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable. And there is some interesting soul - searching. He eventually returned to Britain, dejected and apparently dying. 'Arthur'is the result. He invariably steals any scene in which he features and thoroughly deserved his Oscar. It is darker. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he has never played any other comic role. < br / > < br / > This is a truly splendid movie. Perhaps the best of these was'Bedazzled '. Guilgud only gets a cameo appearance at beginning and as a ghost.",1
Truly this was one of Best Comedies of the 1980s. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his Oscar.,1
"He is to inherit $ 750, 000, 000 if he marries the daughter of fellow millionaire Burt Johnson ( Stephen Elliott ), they woman he and the family have chosen, Susan ( Jill Eikenberry ). Sir John Gielgud was number 35 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and film was number 53 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.",1
"John Gielgud gets all juicy lines and polishes them off with relish. I watched this over the Christmas period, I don't know why but it reminds me of Christmas so I watched it, so there we are.",1
"< br / > < br / > And that's what Dudley Moore is, a wastrel. Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons. That's a full time job as we see demonstrated in Arthur. Frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him. He was not quite as wealthy as Arthur, but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid. He spent his life being a perfect party guest. < br / > < br / > Secondly though, I actually knew a real life Arthur Bach. We should all have such troubles.",1
"I challenge ANYone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud. 4 out of 10 possible. But, apparently, nearly a third of its audience has so managed.",1
"Much satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby / affluent. God rest Dudley Moore ; this was such an enjoyable movie. Yes, I agree, Sir John stole absolutely every scene.",1
"Steve Gordon's 1981 film Arthur is short and simple, but delivers laughs - plenty. Arthur is an interesting fellow.",1
"1928 is in many ways a "" lost year "" in motion pictures. She had excellent comic instincts and timing. < br / > < br / > "" Show People "" is one of the great silent era comedies. He gets Peggy an acting job.",1
She decides to teach Stanley how to read at her home in her spare time. Over time they become romantically involved. < br / > < br > A good film all round.,1
There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years.,1
It's hard to put your finger on this one.,1
He's great too. It really is a great song about New York City as well. She plays a diner waitress.,1
The one - liners are best.,1
"Sadly, Gordon, only in his early forties, died soon after completing this, his only feature film. It plays almost like a 1930's - style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes.",1
There are hilarious set pieces aplenty. It's a shame late Dudley Moore passed away last month ( March 2002 ). ). Arthur and Linda's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film. He also refuses to leave the bottle.,1
You could feel how raw the emotions were during those incredibly hard episodes. He was one of my all time favourite actors.,1
But all and all this show is pretty good.,1
"However, my view was shot out the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny John Ritter accrued.",1
"But I hadn't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful. ! Who was that short little guy "" - when she finds out she faints!! There is a funny scene where she sees a star she doesn't think much of - it's Marion Davies!!! I had seen Marion Davies in a couple of movies and really couldn't understand her appeal. They convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success.",1
WHAT ABOUTORY!!!??? Ya. poor Rory is almost always left out.,1
This family is so real and funny.,1
"< br / > < br / > Plus, i think most people would enjoy this watching it. I was gutted to find out that he had died when i browsed Google.",1
I can't believe John died!,1
"I admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died, i felt the programme did to. Eight Simple rules started as a very entertaining series. I think the Granddad is funny ( Especially when he's watching Great escape ) but feel C. J is unnecessary to show. He is funny in parts but I felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedy series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show. I would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for Paul and Kerry, but later ones were about average at best.",1
"I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything. The next time it shows, I will watch it over over again. This show is awesome.",1
It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. I always laughed at that.,1
James Garner was a good addition.,1
"This was great show to watch, and I'll tell you why it was a great show.",1
"My personal favorite episode is in last season. And it is. Sagal makes a return to being the female lead in a sit - com, and her character is far removed from Peggy Bundy.",1
"She wants to drama, but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics. And also wins the heart of young comic actor William Haines. She gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face, but learns her trade. That in itself makes Show People a film worth saving.",1
John's loss shocked the world. They should be rewarded with Emmy.,1
"She is off wall hilarious with her innocent'blonde'humor and how conceited she is. < br / > < br / > Katey Sagal is great as well, and she too is a likable character. She's always after Bridget, and her character feels like it's just thrown in there. It's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment. Let me say first that this show was top tier when John Ritter was there.",1
"Each one was a standout. Cate is the conservative mom and loving wife. Al Bundy was our hero. Bridget is shallow The supremely - talented Tom Shadyac was involved in the project. Quite a résumé. I know it sounds boring, but comedically, she fits perfectly. Again, this is the kind of perfectionism that we've come to expect from Tom.",1
< br / > < br / > it should never have ended but still love watching repeats everyday.,1
I'm almost surprised it's Disney! This has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment.,1
Life TV network. More so than any show that old. That is the one show that I wish I could see again.,1
Ordinary lives come together in an adult swim class and become extraordinary in a celebration of the diversity of life.,1
But this masterful film proved me wrong. You will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies.,1
I hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it.,1
"The Big Bad Swim, "" a genuinely good independent film, has had to swim upstream on its own. However, her parents are not shown to be involved with her life in any way, which seems odd.",1
The plot is fairly thin. The two actresses give natural performances and work well together.,1
"I enjoyed the scenes in the class immensely, and the drama that took place outside was very poignant. < br / > < br / > What surprised me about the film was how real it felt. Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well. See it if you get opportunity.",1
"A big THANK YOU to the staff of this master piece, and I am waiting for it to be distributed. Writing something genuine and true is challenging.",1
I thought that Avi did a great job in his role.,1
"I never cringed. The Big Bad Swim "" needs to be seen. < br / > < br / > The humor of the film is something like "" Napoleon Dynamite "" meets "" Old School "". The festival highlights some of the best independent and non - mainstream films from the past year.",1
"The big bad swim has a low budget, indie feel about it.",1
"I'm sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance. I don't know why I picked this movie to watch, it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different.",1
"That she had fame handed to her and was undeserving, is often speculated. As a comedienne however, her star shone very brightly. ). At preview, Billy and Peggy bump into.. Charlie Chaplin, who asks for her autograph! with von Stroheim, Walsh and DeMille.",1
"Further, the music is terrific. I was really impressed with this film.",1
"we start to get bit by bit into their lives, witness their troubles, guess of their thoughts. pretty soon in became clear this is no comedy, or at least not a'Jim Carrey type'one.",1
The filming was beautiful. The end Just great.,1
"When a movie makes me feel like that, I know it's really good. She makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend. I felt like my adrenaline had kicked in. Jeff Branson and Jess Weixler also did top - notch jobs. It's beautifully shot and directed, and the casting is excellent. That's a gift. I left theater excited and ready to start writing that long put - off project. I can not say enough nice things about The Big Bad Swim. This is one of those films.",1
"He attempts, more or less, to fend them off, with varying results. The movie covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they go through class.",1
"The Conduit is deep inside Borg Space. There's one problem. Voyager has made it back home. He's like a child. < br / > < br / > Janeway visits Tuvok. But Janeway's expected this! He carried a disease they were too late getting home to cure. The two captains disagree, arguing about the plan.",1
"Voyager's episodes also progresses through time unlike TNG. I was not really a big fan of Star Trek until past 2 - 3 years. I love Tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a Vulcan. Instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined. What a GREAT job! She has developed through 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain.",1
SPOILERS.,1
This is a great ending to the show.,1
"B'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband Tom. The Borg are involved, as they have played a massive part in this period of Voyager. Am I satisfied with the ending? Voyager could have continued. I think I am. It's very tense.",1
"And it was all heavy drama, exhausting in its pace and retakes, action, all at full speed. Try and find a scene in which she doesn't appear.",1
"< br / > < br / > Wow! Colin Roberts, who plays the younger son, also does a great job. She is much better suited to drama than to comedy. Then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs.",1
Yet it was done so well. I applaud the director for making this movie.,1
"I thought this movie did a down right good job. Don't wait for it to be a classic, watch it now and enjoy it.",1
Some very good British actors as well as the one and only Sharon Stone. Just the kind of movie I love.,1
"< br / > < br / > And a fun film it is. It is still titillating, but not done so readily for shock value and buzz as done in the first. Katherine Tramell is bisexual... how shocking! "" In fact, the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertaining. That's the genre.",1
She really impressed me ( like in Casino ). He really sucked.,1
"She's not even close. Compared to Sharon Stone, Madonna is too coarse and BAUERISCH. < Paul Verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew. Rather, she seems to have a slight golden glow ( YES, YEATS ). Attempts at censorship were vehemently denied.",1
"However it is like one of these "" easier dives "" that you see at the Olympics. Check out the memorable quotes section for a chuckle. If not always in the right way. I mean why would anyone put two - and - two together and start thinking she might be a murderer? Equally her reaction to such accusations seems very casual.",1
< br / > < br / > Davies was adorable and lively comedienne. Soon she becomes Patricia Pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend Billy.,1
"Still I recommend it. Catherine Tramell ( Sharon Stone ) is now in London. It feels like a retread of the first. This picks up about a year after the events in "" Basic Instinct "". The acting is good across the board. < br / > < br / > This movie was doomed before it even opened. She survives - - he doesn't.",1
"Go see! That's what movies are designed for - - escapism. The music is superb, reprising the original's theme.",1
Great screenplay.,1
Is that not right? The critics are a bunch of morons. We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. not just good but very good. So we can see whatever we want whenever we want.,1
It still left me wondering at end but in a more satisfactory way. David Morrisey was satisfactory even though he is no Michael Douglas. I cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers.,1
I found this movie to be very good in all areas.,1
thank you for reading.,1
"Give it a shot, you might be glad you did! I found it sick, brilliant, twisted, and psychologically sophisticated.",1
"Not every movie is supposed to be a new The Lord of the Rings! And really, I was very positively surprised!",1
Again she proves to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class - unchallenged. I voted this film 10 and I tell you why : Game opens in London this time.,1
She is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film.,1
"Five years later, we have it. I never would have thought it to end up such as this. It's a film for fun. This film is not an Academy Award winner, nor does it try to be. That said, I shall evaluate the film.",1
So don't listen to them. Stone once again delivered a great character. She looks good and that's.,1
Get over it! What's important is the interactions between these and other characters in story. I don't understand your objections to this movie.,1
"I was captivated by her. Catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection. Her one liners are great, much like in the first one. That goes for critics as well.",1
"It's the character of Catherine Trammell that helped give way for this sequel. Fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen. As such, it never claims to be either. The score is amazing as well. < br / > < br / > At very least it's entertaining and fun to look at it, and that's the movie's only intentions.",1
"Michael Caton - Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, neither Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas. "" Unfortunately, she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick. Since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie, he can keep your attention from beginning to end. First comments on this movie were so vicious that I had to see for myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film, but is not as bad as most comments pretend.",1
Now that is talent. for the first time sometime ]. ),1
I really love this movie.,1
"The best is Nancy. A rod and staff are there to comfort him. Things are not as they seem. In the middle is Oliver. Lacking in judgment, she ignores Bill Sikes'violent nature out of her deep need for love. His innocence is unsullied, but untried as well.",1
I hated the Oliver Twist kid tho. AWESOME. And he has a wonderful singing voice. The supporting actors were great too.,1
"It's still funny and its satirical points still resonate. William Haines gives an engaging, likable performance as her boyfriend and co - star Billy Boone, but this is leading lady's show all the way. Where her career was concerned Davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour, the newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst.",1
One of the last great musicals of the 60s. The musical numbers are all memorable.,1
"As a child I always hated being forced to sit through musicals. for the first time as an adult, I saw it in a new light. It was undeniably catchy and sounded like a real pub tune that drunks might start singing around a piano. Upon viewing "" Oliver! "" was the one musical I remember oddly enjoying as a child, probably because it is one of the darker ones and is appropriately drenched in the spirit of Dickensian squalor.",1
"< br / > < br / > My all - time favourite'' bad guy'' has to be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. < br / > < br / > This movie is both charming, and charismatic as a musical sing - along, as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life.",1
I saw this recently on a cable channel. But what really lifts this to another level is Oliver Reed's performance as Bill Sykes.,1
Delicious! A film for entire family. Costumes are exquisite.... even the shabby ones.,1
"Its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it, it stands on its own. A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.",1
Oliver Reed was masterful. Who will buy this beautiful movie? His wife directed this masterpiece. You Should!,1
"My especial favorite was Jack Wild. I can't get over it's songs. That movie was awesome! He's short, that's what helps.",1
"The underscore for that moment is brilliant. That said, this film is absolutely fantastic! However, I don't mind.",1
< br / > < br / > This movie isn't for everyone. I admit not being that fond of Oliver!,1
The story is about having success in life and the way it changes you. For a moment she even denies her ( poor ) past! !,1
"Lester and Wild do well He makes the long journey to London where he hopes to seek his fortune. The great cinematic musicals were made between 1950 and 1970. Freely adapted from Dickens ’ novel, this vibrant musical is a film version of a successful stage production. This twenty year spell can be rightly labelled the “ Golden Era ” of the genre. Despite the unlawful nature of the job, Oliver finds good friends among his new “ family ”.",1
No comparison. however is that Oliver!,1
"This is a musical adaptation of Dicken's "" Oliver Twist "".",1
"Didn't you like the changes? Oh, Charles, "" she said, "" I'm Jewish. The young woman Fagin does. "" "", she said. "" Dickens tried to improve on Fagin a bit. He left thinking about what she said.",1
"It holds up well, especially Lionel Bart's outstanding songs.",1
"Simply put, Oliver! A multi - Oscar winner and a massive success on its release, Oliver! < br / > < br / > The film was shot solely in studios and on soundstages at Shepperton Film Studios but this does not translate at all to film. The sets perfectly replicate Victorian London, as do the costumes worn by the characters. is one of the greatest musicals of all time.",1
"It's not really Dickens at all. He could be serious and hilarious in the same sentence. < br / > < br / > And it is the comedy that is so often missing from his interpretations. ', on the other hand, is much closer to the mark. < br / > < br / >'Oliver!",1
"For the record, Mark Lester retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath England. The secret was revealed by on a 2004 UK documentary titled "" Oliver! After They Were Famous "".",1
the musical is a favorite of mine. It all just seems perfect. Oliver!,1
"I understand he doesn't like the film, but his reasons are not evident.",1
Very good!,1
I've loved it ever since!! ! Best musical in my opinion of all time. Always makes me cry!,1
"in 1968 on a big cinema screen in Boston when I was a young teenager. The song "" Who Will Buy? "" The sets and musical numbers are mind boggling. Good show!",1
It's Encore Action this month. Catch it on cable if you can. I found that movie to be quite misogynistic.,1
"this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been. It is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre. It simply could have used bit more excitement. Much like "" Vampires "" however this movie's climax near the end is not very intense. The female vampire Una certainly is the coolest vampire since Blade's Deacon Frost.",1
If you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else.,1
"You can almost see the director's temptation to create a movie with a VERY personal note and different to original. This means a lot, because a part of the audience ( also me ) was probably thinking : ""... just because he's a rockstar... "". It really takes some beating. And obviously aiming on the "" From Dusk Till Dawn "" - audience. """,1
"< br / > < br / > So, gore fans might be disappointed, but story fans will not. Is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained? < br / > < br / > I generally would not watch a horror movie. He can act well and that's come to be expected of him. It reaches a happy medium with the effects and story balancing each other. These few instances are forgiveable knowing that Vampires could have been a continuing series. No.",1
"Like the story line, there should have been more to the movie. There were some bad things about this movie. Jon Bon Jovi ( Derek ) was great in this movie.",1
The original Vampires ( 1998 ) is one of my favorites. I was quite surprised at how this played out.,1
Davies and Swanson were friends. They're great together! A sweet romance and delightful spoof of early Hollywood. Odd that MGM never teamed them up in a talkie. < br / > < br / > Davies and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. Polly Moran is a maid. Dell Henderson plays the father. Updated from a previous comment.,1
"If you have never viewed this film and like old time veteran actors, this is the film for you.",1
Very enjoyable.,1
"( Or alongside Ken Berry in one memorable The real merits of'Higher and Higher'are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films. Michele Morgan hears a knock at the door, and asks who's there. < br / > < br / > Sinatra's entrance is quite funny.",1
Highly recommended for it's feel - good factor alone.,1
"Only Michele starts looking at another. Not a bad bunch at all. He's the butler and she's the scullery maid to Leon Errol. In fact Errol is a millionaire who hasn't paid his help for seven months. When Bing did his feature film debut in The Big Broadcast, he played Bing Crosby. Yet it yielded one of their bigger hits It Never Entered My Mind.",1
"brother. And how about "" Eve "" and her apple?",1
"I adore him in Forsyte Saga, and all else I've seen him in. But he outdoes himself here as Arthur. But he does. I loved it so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. And Gilbert Markham was amazingly "" on it "" from the very start of the movie.",1
A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretentions.,1
Another thing. The cast was brilliant. The book is rather underated. This is why the video is rated 15. CONTAINS SPOILERS!,1
"Another BBC classic, highly recommended : this is how romantic literature should be dramatised. No one's perfect ). I just love watching women like these on screen. < br / > < br / > The actors are superb best Brits have to offer. But those old, well - told stories have enduring power, and this is one's a hidden gem. The love story is beautifully handled, with real passion and feeling by well - matched actors.",1
"Other than that, this is very good - quality. All the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life.",1
"So re the story as in the film I'm equivocal. It's well done as per the novel, but somewhat irritating as per today's kind of life.",1
< br / > < br / > Excellent acting great locations.,1
< br / > < br / > This film successfully portrays the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time. < br / > < br / > Tara Fitzgerald is excellent as the long - suffering Helen Markham. I am not even sure if he is a good actor as my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively!,1
Markham's constancy may then be seen as her reward for her faith and unyielding moral character. What can be said of the compelling performance of Tara Fitzgerald? He is the force of passion and hope that will restore Helen's injured spirit. I highly recommend viewing it!,1
The horse scenes are absolutely fantastic!!,1
Where did he learn to ride?,1
I highly recommend it. < br / > < br / > It's very funny how that happens. It's a damn shame they died. You can find that in this film. This Comedy is an instant classic. George Burns deserved that Oscar. He gave a strong comic performance.,1
"There are some very JAWSish moments with the stallion that defy belief. The Man from Snowy River II doesn't reinvent the wheel but is a crowd - pleasing beautiful film that hits some great notes. A little more grit would have sufficed here, we are Aussie's, we can take it!! < br / > < br / > The best thing about this film is the acting.",1
"The film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century, of Australian history, legend and horses.",1
But at all times we still learn a hell of a lot about our bodies that we should be * required * to know. It is amazing how we function. < br / > < br / > The subject matter skip around an awful lot.,1
I've never been huge on IMAX films. < br / > < br / > Our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable.,1
you will understand when you see it. ! Well i am going to go against the grain on this film so it seems. After 2 or 3 mins i actually found myself scared ( quite rare ).,1
"< br / > < br / > "" Creep "" is a HORROR movie and it is a pretty good one! So why complain about it? So, if you want to make yourself a very, very scaring hour. - SMALL SPOILER HEREIN! I am wondering : what do people expect of such kind of movie?",1
"'Creep'although a little bit loose on information, proves itself worthy of a true gory classic.",1
This film exceeded my expectations.,1
Anything that has a rating below 6 / 10 is clearly utter nonsense. ! < br / > < br / > There is much mystique in this film. How was'Craig'created and what happened to him? < br / > < br / > A fantastic film with a large chill factor.,1
"Now if they would work, they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story TV show. My rate is 7. The meets is explosive and liberating for the old questions.",1
"Yes, you heard me right - I wanted a clichéd twist ending! And it does just that.",1
"The obvious aspect - to - love is the outrageous gore! What it hasn't got is logic and a solid plot but, to tell you the truth, that didn't bother me for one second. "" I really dug the creep - character! The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used. There's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make - up, as well as the sound effects, are very convincing.",1
"In terms of succeeding in what it set out to do, Creep does cleverly create ( especially at the beginning ) a scary sense of isolation and tense fear. However, after a hectic working day, she dozes off and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform.",1
I really do hope he gets to make better films in future. It was a fun ride.,1
"She awakens to find the place deserted, but quickly comes to realise that she is far from alone. Someone, or something, is down there with her and it's intentions are wholly malicious. A horror film writer should not need feel compelled to dot every i and cross every t, in the same way a writer of political thrillers might be expected to. An excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script. The retention of a certain sense of mystery is to be welcomed and reminds us that in this film the ride was always going to be more important than the exact destination.",1
"Emory's father - a dedicated union man - is sure the plant will reopen and recalls for his son all the short - lived closures during his own 35 years at the mill. The mill, which once employed 45, 000, has seen its numbers dwindle to 5, 000 recently and now 1, as the plant just shut its doors, leaving a single security guard. Meanwhile, some of the unemployed men take demeaning make - work jobs or hop in their trucks and take off in a desperate search for employment. as a lifetime of hard work and devotion to job, union, church and family have left him with nothing and nowhere to turn. He hits rock bottom when in a drunken rage he manhandles his young sons and knocks his wife to the floor.",1
Where will it be better for a blue - collar steel worker?. Some scenes between Emory and his father are moving. 8 / 10. However where in the U. S. can they move to?. It is very disturbing and realistic.,1
"Ic an't find it anywhere! Being 29, I remember the'80's and my father working in a factory. This movie struck home for me.",1
"< br / > < br / > The heavy metal score - - was someone making a pun? Strauss is completely believable in his role, and Pamela Reed is, as always, wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before he put on weight.",1
"< br / > < br / > Ah, afraid they might sue, so he changed them into men. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? For me, the pleasure linger. First off, I dislike almost all Neil Simon movies.",1
"See how many times you can spot the camera crew too. Everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken. Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. Buy it if you have a sense of humour. Following a Mad Max 3 (! )",1
"This list is totally accurate and I It's a totally delirious movie ; I loved it. < br / > < br / > Okay, let's not fool each other here. They each keep half a dollar note as a symbol that McBain is in Santos'debt. One of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time composing a list containing all the main stupidities and insensible moments of "" McBain "".",1
"Total Recall, Top Gun. It took Pulp Fiction to wake him from the slumber he had been in. The scenes and actors and explosions etc. Whoever he or she was I like them because I love this film!",1
McBain is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle.,1
< br / > < br / > McBain then asks his good ol'Vietnam buddies to help him. I think not.,1
"I love it for its originality, most fun. His demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going. No one else is willing to go that far.",1
"He really brought me back to the monsters of the 80's. Sure, they're not for everybody but to each his own. What a fun b - movie!",1
"Here's my main point : Walter Matthau is flat - out perfect, even beyond perfect, in this movie. All the criticisms registered here have valid points. I agree that Matthau was unfortunate to be up against Nicholson in "" Cuckoo's Nest "" that year. < br / > < br / > About 1976 Oscars... This is a masterpiece of comic acting.",1
This movie is not your typical horror movie.,1
Yes it's a low budget B - movie. Also Richard Elfman does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend.,1
I would be angry too! ScareCrows look was really good! reaction when they see him!,1
"As if he's an expert on that. Mulder and Scully have some good dialog, always a plus.",1
And it's very much an episode of wonderful moments.,1
"As a huge fan of both series I subscribe to the latter belief, although the less charitable may not do. Forget Fearful Symmetry's dubious originality and just enjoy it as deeply satisfying X File.",1
1958. The sleepy small Southern town of Clarksburg.,1
George Burns did a great job. This one was also very awesome. Boy are you wrong.,1
"This is how all "" car movies "" should be made.",1
"al., Martin Sheen showed us The Way in this great feature.",1
< br / > < br / > The ending is grand. Vic Morrow as the villain is superb.,1
"A black flamed'34 Ford coupe. The race begins... The Sheriff knows McCord knows. The ones who tried to outrun the Sheriff? He knows how his brother died. Then one day, a stranger drove into town. Michael McCord.",1
"I suspect the latter. Let's hope same can happen with North Square. Sexy, intelligent and funny.",1
"Saying a film is depressing isn't necessarily a bad thing. Be prepared to watch segments about famine, death and disease.",1
It is tear - jerking and very heart warming. ! The Good Earth is a great movie!!,1
"His is now a legendary luminescence. So I now gratefully welcome it into my soul with gladness. So many years have I waited to see this eternal story! I was not ready, perhaps. All parts equal, necessary and perfect. She amply deserved her Oscar. But all will not come from it with the joy that I did.",1
"She does not even look Chinese! I think you can. Luise Rainier plays Olan. Its a must see, just look beyond casting.",1
< br / > < br / > Shara Reiner succeeded in her role as ( O - Lane ) by this brilliant evidence that she won An Academy Awarded as a best actress in 1937.,1
"Very good! I think the best line of the film is Burns mentioning that Matthau called him "" a son of a bitch bastard "". They cannot get on all the time, they are both forgetful, especially during conversation, but they do it eventually.",1
"Of course, the next looter about to be found out and shot is the main character of the film, the former kitchen slave girl O - Lan ( for whose portrayal Luise Rainer, now 99 - years - old, won her second consecutive best actress Oscar ).",1
This movie is based on an award winning novel and chronicles a family starting with the son's arranged marriage to a slave girl. The movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat hammy performance by the lead played by Paul Muni. The definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it'pulled off pretty well.,1
She has been called wooden and one - note. < br / > < br / > Then there is Luise Rainer. There is a small grain of truth in that. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung.,1
"The locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects. However here learns his lesson, then wins.",1
"Luise Rainer is a servant girl who gets married to Muni. Other then that, it's pretty good. Everybody stars to head north by Muni stays behind at first.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it. A common formula told with the unique perspective of a Chinese family ( especially for 1937 ) makes the film a classic. Rainers performance is so complete, she is nearly unrecognizable.",1
"He becomes selfish, self - centered and takes credit for the find. The newly found wealth transforms Wang Lung. With all that help, he succeeds in saving the farm.",1
"In the end he comes to realize that his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Pearl S. Buck's story did come alive through the magic of the chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school.",1
"* * * * The book like the movie is called "" The Good Earth. "" Highly recommended for all audiences. From the upper shelf of great Classic Books, comes this masterful story written by Pearl Buck.",1
"The special effects and costumes are very good for time period. She basically only has three emotions : submissive, hungry, and heart - broken.",1
An excellent film!,1
"But in "" Good Earth "" she shows that she can really act! Like hell. His character is not likeable one to me. ( Yeah right, A PEARL!! ) This is where the term "" classic film "" comes from.",1
"Rainer helps in the field, bears and raises the kids, does the housework. The rest of her literary output never matched The Good Earth. Not the political struggles of China, but the lives and toil of the every day people we find in The Good Earth.",1
I came away from the film thinking YES! I was happily proved wrong.,1
That was astounding to view.,1
"< br / > < br / > Large scale and touching, what more could a movie lover want! It is a 10. Sure, 65 years have passed since Thalberg's last production was filmed. But fellow IMDB members, come on, this movie is surely one of the masterpieces of the 30's! But as Olan, her use of visual vocal is memorable.",1
In 1937 studio chiefs believed that any actor could / should be able to play any role. End of story. The movie is 67 years old.,1
"Why? Get with it, people. So, why isn't this movie out on DVD? And'The Return of The Soldier'is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered. So can those checking out Oscar winner Julie Christie.",1
"< br / > < br / > I didn't even recognize Ann - Margaret at first and feel that her performance has been underrated. Margaret says, "" We quarreled, and as you rowed away, you turned your face away from me. "" This movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed.",1
"'But is this a good idea? He wants to renew his relationship with Margaret. Telling Chris this, weighs the Shrink, will certainly restore him to'normal. Jenny wants to help. They both are in love with him. Its a delicate story. Chris has forgotten totally about Kitty. Kitty ( Julie Christie ) is vacuous and snobbish.",1
< br / > < br / > This one stays with you forever.,1
The acidity of Willy with the perplexed amnesic Al is a mixture made in heaven. Walter Matthau and George Burns just work so well together.,1
"Sir Ian Holm has a smaller role as the doctor treating him. She is still a fantastic actress, comedy or drama. She makes Margaret Grey into a likable character and you see why a regal captain fell in love with her.",1
"< br / > < br / > I exited the theater room very pleased, and hungry for more. Forget Neo and Bourne and all those half - baked made up modern heroes. And the only one time where he was weakened is when Mélanie Thierry shaved his beard! I rest my case.",1
"In Radivoje Bukvic portrayed Goran well. When I sat down to watch'Largo Winch'I expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I stood up, I've seen both of these ; and more.",1
"I'm not aware of "" Largo Winch "" as a comic book ( or is it graphic novel?",1
"After a first - and failed - attempt with a TV show, the real thing begins. The movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of series. As a 1st class - fan of the comic book, I must confess I was nicely surprised. The actors are good, so is the scenario, though it might seem too fast.",1
Lovers of Classic Romantic Comedies will enjoy this picture!,1
Would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one? The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy.,1
"I recently bought this movie with a bunch of other LaserDiscs from eBay. ( OK, weired example. ) Yet still, I liked it a lot. There is nothing fake or pretentious about them. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart. If you likes Notting Hill then you will like Shop around the corner.",1
"< br / > < br / > Lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry. < br / > < br / > This is a wonderful, unsung romance. < br / > < br / > There's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which I appreciated.",1
"Well, it is a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated.",1
"And Matthau is every bit his match, if a tad more crotchety. scene.",1
Every time I see this scene it moves me. They all have plans for their own Christmas eve. As each of his employees leave he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each and everyone of them politely turn him down.,1
"However, Lubitsch's film runs much deeper than that. This subtle subtext brings a more meaningful, personal touch to the film in fact, even as I write this review, I'm beginning to appreciate story even more.",1
The two don't get along on the job because each has fallen in love with a unseen pen pal.,1
"< br / > < br / > All the acting is magnificent. Gold stars all round to performers. The dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days. As Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing. It moves effortlessly from scene to scene. Some of her other films are worth catching. His moment of truth is very moving. Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair.",1
Two warring shop workers in a leather - goods store turn out to be secret sweethearts as they correspond under box - number aliases.,1
I was amazed at this movie.,1
A must see! Has there ever been a movie more charming than this?,1
Lubitsch managed to get best and he obviously gave his best. Every time I watch this movie I am more impressed by the whole production.,1
"fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through PO Box 237. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is one of the sweetest and most feel - good romantic comedies ever made. Their bickering takes them through the next six months, even as they both ( unconsciously, of course! ) There's just no getting around that, and it's hard to actually put one's feeling for this film into words.",1
"They're the type of character actors that Hollywood sadly no longer employs. Just as good with repeat viewings. "" Enjoy!",1
"This can obviously be compared to the recent You've Got Mail, and the original wins in every way.",1
"If you want to see a great movie, this is it.",1
"He makes himself very scarce. Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife. Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time. Back in the day of the big studio system, the darndest casting decisions were made. His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing. In fact Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda back then. Bressart has my favorite moments in film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions.",1
I particularly like William Tracy as Pepi.,1
"A must see for all! This is a truly classic movie in its story, acting, and film presentation. She was such a beautiful, young woman, and so sweet in her personality portrayals.",1
By far the best thing about this technological age is not CSI but DVD that can at one and the same time make these classics available to nostalgics and show the Matrix freaks how big boys used to do it.,1
"< br / > < br / > Sara Haden graces the small role of a sales clerk. An accomplished scene stealer, he allows no emotion to escape unvented. Theirs is one of the classic love stories of cinema.",1
Calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading.,1
"I just thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Jimmy Stewart is a special favorite of mine. I also think they were made much better in many ( but not all ) cases. of this film.",1
Don't miss it! A one of a kind film. Everything looks so perfect and dream - like.,1
"Willy wakes up and picks up the phone. A pause. """,1
"It'funny, pointed, and sad all at once.",1
"< br / > < br / > This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. There are so many nuanced performances in this. I greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate work of Stewart. This is a movie that gets better each time I see it. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief. Very believable in every facet of his role. Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding.",1
"In this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done. No comparison. This is a great example of that.",1
"Well you wont be - this story has a sweet, almost sugary ending - but we all know it is the ending we all want. Joseph Schildkraut as the womanising arrogant "" Vadas "" - so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from beginning. Confused? Clearly Kralik is besotted with Klara - but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the "" pen - friend "".",1
< br / > < br / > That is why these films will live forever! Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to the American cinema is enormous.,1
It will leave a smile on your face for days. The is certainly the case with Aoki.,1
Just rent it and you will not sorry! !,1
"It's the tale of one person learning to love life again, pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once more. < br / > < br / >",1
I understand that it was more popular than Titanic in Japan.,1
"I approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised. The cultural contrasts are thus intriguing. He is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing. While the music is nice and the dancing colourful, for me the movie is not about dancing.",1
"Richard Benjamin shines as Matthau's nephew and agent. And, Matthau's bellowing tends to get a little old. I think you have to slide. "" Such is the premise of this hilarious Neil Simon play made into a movie. < br / > < br / > Matthau : "" Wait, wait.",1
"Masayuki Suo, who directed this fine film, is on a role. < br / > < br / > The story is engaging.",1
When truth comes out it is quite funny.,1
This touches me very deeply.,1
made me laugh and cry.,1
Shall We Dance?,1
She is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio. See the movie. They are friendly and warm and inviting. < br / > < br / > Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the film.,1
Or cried. A +.,1
Have to get the DVD I guess. My favorite character must be Mr. Aoki. Would make for the perfect sequel if they had. Not sure if I want to.,1
Aoki's character is both hilarious and pitiful. < br / > < br / > This film is truly keeper.,1
"So, this is good. For me it's worth seeing for Burns alone. I give it a 7. Matthau's character really makes this hard to love. Also I never liked Matthau.",1
"Pain. < br / > < br / > Sad. < br / > < br / > It is rare that a movie truly moves me, but "" Shall We Dance? """,1
Rather Billy Elliot like I would say. Good entertainment! I enjoyed that film as well.,1
We can all see ourselves in the everyman. This movie was charming.,1
< br / > < br / > I can't even think of this movie without smiling!! I love it... and I think most people will too. It is a classic in every sense of the word.,1
"and I really loved it. What a lovely and delightful movie! ( "" Dance With Me? """,1
"Breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of Japanese society, they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away. In instant that it takes his train to pass, he is enthralled by her. This movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog.",1
Okay. This is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious.,1
Imagine that! I can't think of anything I didn't like about it.,1
"< br / > < br / > 10 out of 10. Truly a well written film. Highly recommended. The dancing is great, too. I happen to be a fan of any movie with dancing of any sort, for that aspect.",1
"< br / > < br / > "" Enter!!!!!!!!! "" Definitely one of my desert island films.",1
"< br / > < br / > All these makes it moving and fun film to watch. Instead, there are downfalls, revelations and redemption.",1
He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule. It is a warm very worthwhile film to see. Shall we dance?,1
"It definitely deserves 10 stars. < br / > < br / > And yes Aoki is funny : - D I felt lost. I understand why some of you dislike this movie. Shall We Dansu? """,1
"The original Japanese film is touching, subtle and wonderfully acted. Monsoon Wedding - I list this first for a reason, outstanding film! Johnny Stechino - Very funny Italian mistaken identity flic! The remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon. I simply love this movie. I was aghast when I first saw the trailer for the remade US Version and who was starring in it. 3.",1
"It just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance. Is thisynchronous or what? Yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe. All of the film's characters are taken seriously, as they are, and none are diminished because of their "" imperfections. """,1
"Very entertaining and definitely recommended. Viewing "" Impulse "" is a very satisfying experience.",1
I saw this at about 2. Government undertakings or shifty corporations involved in dodgy shadowy dealings. Overall a good film.,1
"So we went instead to see this movie. If you have any conspiracy theory's going around in your head, you will want to watch this one.",1
Definitely. Did I enjoy it? Scary stuff. There are several surreal and very unsettling scenes that have remained etched in my memory all this time.,1
Great to watch late at night!,1
"answer : quietly, deadpan, and with perfect timing as George Burns does here. Richard Benjamin is very funny as straight man - trying to get at Burns through the window etc. Even the small parts are great. < br / > < br / > Enterrrrr!",1
"< br / > < br / > That'just my opinion anyway. If anything, this film only scratches the surface - It doesn't go as far as it could go.",1
"Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. A real classic, ten out of ten!",1
"And one last, heretical note : Those mountains do look gorgeous in color.",1
"Louise Brooks! There is no Dietrich. There is only Louise Brooks "" ; and there is, thank heavens! And that's what this film is. This is the third of her European masterpieces.",1
"Also check her out in'Pandora's Box'if you can find it. I think I truly love this film. "" I don't know. This may have been the way they were shot.",1
"Here she has a chance to be charming without the dark side of her Pabst collaboration. What "" Prix "" has that the Pabst films don't is music. In this early French film, the whole Louise Brooks mystique is fleshed out powerfully with a conjunction of image, song and music. This is full of major spoilers, so beware. It continues on screen after husband Andre, who has followed her to the screening room, shoots and kills her. The tango also plays a plot point in "" Prix, "" being the music she danced with on her short rise to stardom after becoming Miss Europe.",1
"That Brooks's character decides to leave her boyfriend ( even if she does "" reconcile "" with him later ) is also a little ahead of her time. A story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely swan whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise.",1
"We saw the silent version of this film, and it is quite simply shimmeringly beautiful. Fairy - tale, however, turns to tragedy.",1
"). A bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound, which is a bit off.",1
"Seeing this makes it only more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last starring role. < br / > < br / > Louise Brooks, of course, is responsible for saving film from obscurity. All of the characters are drawn with nuance. This is silent film technique at its pinnacle. Her role here, more than in the Pabst films for which she's best known, is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with. Prix de Beauté tells its story visually, with exciting, imaginative camera - work.",1
THE SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning Neil Simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between Matthau and Burns. The scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and can't get the name of product right is a classic. Matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance. The problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other.,1
We are all the poorer for that. The movie is very energetically filmed by director Augusto Genina and cinema tographers Rudolf Mate and Louis Nee. Louise Brooks gives a wonderful performance in this well - made French melodrama. This is really some of the best stuff of the early days of film. And the tragic storyline only underscores greater tragedy that this is the final starring role for Louise Brooks.,1
"A sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again. All in all I have seen this film at least 10 times. < br / > < br / > Artisticly shot, actors portray exactly their role.",1
"As another reviewer said, who knew Rathbone could be so funny! "", to which Levant responds, "" Ah, it'only a part - time job. """,1
And then they discover what they've been doing. < br / > < br / > Crosby and Martin sing terrifically. Good job by all.,1
And who knew Rathbone could be funny? ).,1
< br / > < br / > And I do think you will like The Sunshine Boys. What happens here is pretty hilarious. Or at least pretty close to as an active performer. The doctor sketch that Matthau and Burns do is directly from their material. < br / > < br / > Burns brought a bit of personal into this film as well.,1
Shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage. Thank you Dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of world. But when this stage is Israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style.,1
"Instantly, you are drawn in to Dan's plight, and you can't fail to be deeply moved. If you have an ounce of passion, and have ever been in love, see this film.",1
Maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her. Carole and Arthur are great together. I loved it! Big brawl and Maggie ends up stuck in Panama. Romance.,1
"Of course, he works in the beauty salon on the ship! Good timing and clever banter at the beginning. Some good singing by Lamour.",1
"It is worth a look. Enough with plot. Then the temptress arrives in the form of Dorothy Lamour. Heck, not even your typical Hollywod movie of any era. Skids is a bum who doesn't care that he's a bum. The movie has fantastic montage sequences that dazzled me.",1
"It's yet another adaption of the play Burlesque which apparently was popular back in the day. That's an interesting work, believe me. Also Anthony Quinn is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on make for Lombard.",1
"Why couldn't he have been assigned to a project with them? Mona Lisa "" was the only tune in CAPTAIN CAREY. Most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre. I suspect it just dates too much now to be well liked.",1
You can literally hear the script crackle. Simon's carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by Matthau and Burns. Period.,1
"They aren't your typical charming young yuppie couple, as generally depicted in on screen romances, but an ordinary working class, middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles. Iris discovers that Stanley is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen.",1
"His glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and role as a passive observer. Their on - screen marriage near the end 1953 - 54 season captured national even on kinescope. But it's really more a matter of adjusting to the different style. < br / > < br / > "" Mr. Peepers "" is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value. Once you get into the characters it will win over most intelligent viewers. Tony Randall played his brash best friend, history teacher Harvey Weskit. Like a lot of baby boomers this and "" Ding Dong School "" are my earliest memories of television.",1
"The DVD box is shown on the title page here on IMDb. So far ( aside from the 1st episode ), the image quality is quite good.",1
"nights. ( you had to have been there ). It was a must see for the whole family, I believe on Sun. I saw somewhere that the 1st TV wedding ( big one anyway ) was Tiny Tim on the Carson show. Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on screen.",1
"i, too, loved this series when i was a kid.",1
He doesn't get mentioned again. I think that the movie was kind of weird.,1
"And, yes, the acting is sub - par. However, if you can overlook this flaw, the setting is great. Yes, the gore is laughable. Yes, it is cheaply made.",1
I wasn't initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly. Believe me! Not a bad word to say about this film really.,1
7 out of 10.,1
"There are many reasons why I said that. You will really enjoy it. I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as the host. If you ask me, that was pretty darn funny.",1
"The 1976 film starred Walter Matthau as Willie, and George Burns as Al. The question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will Willie wring Al's neck? So he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial. < br / > < But Willie can't remember lines unless they are funny, and keeps flubbing them. Neil Simon's THE ODD COUPLE set up a model for many of his later plays. when Al knocks on the door.",1
Go watch something else! I can't believe how many people hate Hal Sparks!,1
's Soup. I think I hold this show in good company. ). They're obviously being ironic. And that's part of what makes this show funny. < br / > < br / > I love the scathing review of pop culture that this show gives.,1

"Anne Rice is incredible and I ask myself, why is she'symbolically'writing about my family and I'm not. I have cousins obviously black aka African Americans and others who can "" pass "" as white and chose not to. Leza I recommend this movie to everyone.",1
"Rather picking actors that looked near white in a sense, could have been more thought out.",1
"< br / > < br / > 8 out of 10 stars! However, it wasn't enough to make me dislike the mini series.",1
"When I saw the previews featuring the ( dreaded ) blond - haired Ri'chard, I expected a buffoon, a fop, a caricature - - I was pleasantly surprised.",1
My daughter was fascinated by the movie. We have made it a part of our library.,1
No!,1
"It lead to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slaves. < br / > < br / > The characters are very three dimensional, and have been well - rendered in this adaption of the novel, by Anne Rice. That is to say, they weren't slaves, but they were still exploited to a certain extent.",1
To be perfectly honest i wasn't disappointed. Christ its bad! The prison guard Hank is woeful too.,1
It gets better as it moves along. And ends with a bang.,1
Ity only lasted one year.,1
It is a psychological thriller. Please don't be fooled by the rating by IMDb. I am surprised at IMDb's low rating of this movie. This movie is worth it. Reel. < br / > < br / > Kudos to the acting as well.,1
"That's a red herring. 'Camp'is a misreading of the tone of this story. < br / > < br / > And it is twisty. He IS acting here. Time travel, Mind Control, secret experiments and Nazi's who may NOT be dead... yet. It's horror - - but not a splatterfest. This would be a good choice for Saturday Midnight sit down.",1
"While I honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre, I feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. The score just plain sucked. The main problem I see with this film is its score, which screams with every note, "" This is a cheap - ass movie. "" < br / > < br / > So what's my holistic grading of this piece? < br / > < br / > The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau. This aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress, and one cannot place too much blame, therefore, upon Barbeau. There's not much more to say here.",1
"Muddled. Horribly structured. """,1
"< br / > < br / > Burns : Maybe later. A hilarious Neil Simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end. I got coconut, pineapple and graham.",1
I've been looking for the name of this film for years.,1
"From the very beginning, it holds a person's interest. To think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable! Strongly recommended by me for At times having to swim in dangerous waters, alone, frightened, injured, she always managed to keep going. I never tire of this fantastic movie.",1
I have no idea whether it was ever released on video. I have been looking for this for years.,1
This is indeed quite a compliment as I have hundreds of movies! I would recommend anyone to look at this movie. This is why this movie is so appealing. You will not be sorry.,1
"< br / > < br / > This, like many other movies, is not for everyone. I actually went out of my way to obtain a copy so I could show this movie to my son.",1
"It also should be shown more often on satellite movie channels. I believe a condensed form of the book was published in "" Reader's Digest "" soon after the actual event occurred. Most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude.",1
Not quite kind of Christmas cheer I was used to seeing at the time. Definitely not a Rankin - Bass production.,1
"It isn't brilliant ; yet it's got some good humorous parts. That was a bit far fetched. But, to compensate the missing special effects, the landscape does the trick. Original, certainly, but not brilliant.",1
"I give a 9 of 10. Scary Movie, loads of Scifi spoofs etc. )",1
"Well, so I was. And so I really love this movie.",1
Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear as themselves. in one of Neil Simon's best plays.,1
"( This was Sellers'second film of 1959 concerning a tiny country matching wits with the world, the other being "" The Mouse That Roared, "" of course. ) Ian Bannen almost steals show here as Gaillardia's suave king, and my girl Lucianna is as appealing as can be in her minor role. Terry - Thomas underplays this part nicely, as does Sellers in his role as Prime Minister Amphibulos of the tiny country.",1
So what's with everyone voting it down? It even had a decent twist of an ending. The music was lush and well - thought - out.,1
"This movie was a genuine happy surprise, the satire is genius.",1
"Ultimately, Salva is the victim of his own success in the end. Salva shows he is a natural for the reality show. He transforms himself into a Christ - like figure who is an instant success in the program. < br / > < br / > The ensemble cast has some good moments in the film.",1
I highly recommend it.,1
Could it have been completely fabricated? And almost as disturbing.,1
It is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people. I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the LDS faith. Brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints ; rather he led them confidently by inspiration.,1
"He fleashens out the story and the characters. But I think that Ross and screenwriter, playwright Simon improved on it. It's just a wonderful film.",1
"This is a wonderful movie about the struggle of the Mormons and their final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. People came to this country to escape religious persecution, and yet they could not. Their fate is left unclear regarding her conversion, and one does wonder about polygamy in their case. You can't beat either one for eye candy, however.",1
Then Joseph was killed.,1
"Charity to those in need or not, 3. Family is high in importance, 4. < br / > < br / > 1. I recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that Hathaway interpreted in his film.",1
The issue is not emphasized. I would love to know whether Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith.,1
"Thanks FOX for another outstanding DVD - - and thank you, James D'Arc for your great commentary! One of the fun bits of information deals with Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the title role.",1
Fight scenes were good.,1
Together they did a great job. ! She also did good job editing the film.,1
"Sarafina was very entertaining. This is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students. The fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime. Also, it changes some of the details from other accounts.",1
I watched it and fast forwarded through the musical numbers. I bought the video for practically nothing at a videostore.,1
I'll treasure this little find until it wears out. < br / > < br / > Clearly nobody else had either.,1
"I have to say out of all Micheaux's films, Swing is the best! This film reminds me of 42nd Street starring Bebe Daniels and Ruby Keeler. The sexy, hot female dancer Consuela Harris would put Ann Miller and Gyspy Rose Lee to shame.",1
"Thank You. If there is a VHS, or DVD out there on the play, Please notify me ASAP. Although it has been 12 years since this story has been told, it is still one that lays heavy in my heart. Thank You Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such a astonishing story. This simply surpass a five star, I rate it a ten.",1
"< br / > < br / > The other thing is his narrative style, heaping irony upon irony upon irony but still making it hilariously funny. I am a huge fan of Vonnegut's work and I'm very fond of this movie, but I wouldn't say that this is a film of the "" Mother Night "" that I read. When people say that Vonnegut is unfilmable, two things come to my mind.",1
"There's a catch, though. Nolte and Lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as "" a nation of two. "" He's captured by Americans who are bitter because of his betrayal. He's beaten senseless by an ex - GI. His house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations. His adored wife, Sheryl Lee, knows nothing of what's going on, nor does she care. The war ends and the trouble begins.",1
"I could go on, really... no role is treated to a less than stellar performance. It is intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. It is well - told and well - thought out.",1
"It's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime, which is what being a spy in WW2 is really all about. After seeing Keith Gordon's film adaptation of his book, it will be an immediate must - read in the near future. But it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique.",1
< br / > < br / > It will change you if you do.,1
< br / > < br / > One of the best films I've ever seen.,1
"Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really "" vonneguty "".",1
"And, to be frank, you might be right. It's from Howard's POV.",1
"After the war, he lives anonymously until competing factions wish to dig up his past.",1
"Far fetched yes, impossible, no. I have yet to see a film with Nolte in it that I did not like. aetv. Nolte has a a full range of acting talents.",1
"But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration.",1
"The central question ( indeed, a question that has frustrated many critics ) of the movie and Kurt Vonnegut's source novel is, "" is Campbell a hero or a traitor? """,1
"I would not place this movie as one of the best I've seen, but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching. Of course not. Does this mean that the movie misses the mark? His whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance.",1
Do not miss this one!,1
"Cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love. And he realizes that... well, watch the movie and you'll see. < br / > < br / > Alan Arkin is absolutly hilarious as George Kraft.",1
Nick Nolte did an excellent job this film.,1
One of my most favorite films. com movie database.,1
"). Mother Night is a very good Vonnegut novel, and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film. Hard to categorize the film - perhaps it's an avant garde spy thriller? The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Mother Night has tight direction and a solid cast. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as always.",1
"Sheryl Lee is also excellent, and the same can be said for the whole cast in general. After the war, he tries to conceal his identity, but the past comes back and haunts him.",1
"Terrific! These questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years. Can you live without paying attention to the political changes? What is guilt? But as I casually saw this movie, I was totally captive by the story. What is important in our life?",1
"Very much recommended. Overall, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels.",1
"This is a very chilling, and for the most part, a well thought out drama. Nolte more than pulls off the role, and fits the plot quite well for what it's asking.",1
"Yes, he has nothing but army surplus "" White Christmas "" albums. < br / > < br / > Overall, I was constantly surprised and impressed as I watched this movie. < br / > < br / > Campbell was also a very Vonnegut character, portrayed perfectly by Nick Nolte. So goes! I have never seen an author, all of the intelligence and life behind the workings of a novel, translated so well to film.",1
This movie pleasantly surprised me.,1
"The casting is inspired : Nolte is understated in triumph, bewildered in defeat, decisive in judgment. Watch, also, for Kurt Vonnegut's cameo near the end of the film. Alan Arkin delivers a totally lovable, but equally treacherous, Soviet spy.",1
< br / > < br / > Recommended.,1
"Otherwise, this might be exactly the film you wish they made more often. As far as I'm concerned there's no flaws here. < br / > < br / > Enjoy. "" Convicts "" is very much a third act sort of film. Masterson is not necessarily a good director.",1
"It's brilliant! How many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that? It is a powerful, affecting piece of cinema.",1
for the first time. I recommend it.,1
"Even with different voice, Bugs is definitely his mischievous self and I laughed myself blue the whole time! Anyway, I highly recommend Elmer's Pet Rabbit. whenever Elmer catches him in his bed. In fact, according to Thad, he's channeling Jimmy Stewart ( his "" shy boy "" type personality of that time ).",1
"However, despite this, this is still a very enjoyable film. This is a very, very early Bugs Bunny cartoon. A true "" anarchist "" instead of the hero of the later cartoons. !",1
"There's some very clever humour in this film, which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors. An effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt. But there isn't really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep rest of the film interesting throughout it's entire running time.",1
7,1
"The plot has several interesting twists, and stays suspenseful and uncanny throughout the film. Overall, "" Guardian of the Abyss "" is another interesting and creepy HHH tale, and my fellow Hammer fans should not miss it. Antiques dealer Michael ( Ray Lonnen ) stumbles over a mysterious old scrying glass.",1
"When he picks up a clearly petrified girl who's running from the cult to avoid being sacrificed, Michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy. Recommended! Whoever said that horror wasn't an educational film genre, huh?",1
"It has a "" close - up "" personal quality to the narrative. I wonder if this movie was made for TV?",1
I can not remember the original tale. The other actors are well for their parts.,1
"Show this movie to your daughters. The score is remarkable, breezy and pure. It will end up becoming a lifetime comfort film.",1
It's now my favorite movie and I only saw it today and I'd recommend it to anyone above 15 as long as you're somewhat mature......,1
Reese Witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one.,1
Warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well.,1
This movie is bound to be a classic. It was well cast and believable.,1
"I'm sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending, that's why this made this move such a good movie. I thought this was a very good movie.",1
"This sweet tale shortly will be in our private library. Look, my taste is like any others ', eclectic. It is joy and a gem, a film all too scarce in this world of hardening hearts.",1
watching him die made me cry for whole day. i just could not believe it.,1
"My mom and I watched this film together, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It's an ending where, although unexpected and tragic, the movie's overall effect is not harmed by it.",1
"It was life - changing, IT REALLY WAS!!! I don't see how anyone couldn't love this film.",1
The movie paints an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes. However it's on DVD and worth money. < br / > < br / > This movie should have gotten more notoriety. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease.,1
"7 out of 10 stars I was so surprised by how great The Man In The Moon truly was. This movie is so entertaining and is so aware of its tone, and its just a fabulous film.",1
Loved it. Reese Witherspooon's first movie.,1
"To this day, tractors are pretty dangerous. But elements for this are set up subtly. A young man named Court is loved by everyone.",1
"As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a stunning film debut. All the acting is superb.",1
). For some reason I found Jason London on a tractor funny. Maureen's character is quite underdeveloped I think. Because she's a few years older?,1
Every frame of The Man in Moon is evidence of film making at its best.,1
"I watched this movie by chance, get curious by the trailer on TV.",1
The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other.,1
"Otherwise, it's done with rare emotional perfect - pitch. It's intimate and honest, and it sticks to ribs.",1
but also for it's realism. < br / > < br / >,1
"Also there is Tess Harper, Jason London, and a young, young Reese Witherspoon. As if it all really happened. And mostly, it's for two reasons. Love story or not.",1
"Danni becomes attracted to Court, and Court to Danni. She wants to be Maureen but doesn't see that she is beautiful herself. They yell and argue and Danni leaves.",1
"The rest of the cast was very good as well. Jason London does a fine job as well. The Man In The Moon "" is a pretty good movie.",1
Feel free to cry.,1
I would give The Man in the Moon 8.,1
"There are feelings to sort out, lessons to learn, and truths to face in this sweet - natured film that packs an emotional wallop. This is one of very best films of 1991. * * * * of 4 stars. The music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene, but never becoming intrusive.",1
Brilliant!,1
Buy this dvd and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art.,1
What a delightful movie.,1
This show is good. I really wanna know how story's going to be.,1
"Guess what? Even Detective Emerson Cod's character has continued to grow in complexity. The show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen "" P. D. "", I highly recommend watching it!",1
"A Modern day Fairy Tale that Brings my Spirits up and Holds my attention throughout the entire show. I think the Acting and Casting is just perfect, Each Character brings Something Unique to the show that adds to it's perfection. It was as if Pushing Daisies Brought ABC back to life for me.",1
"Definitely give it a chance, and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are. I couldn't help smiling after every episode I watched. I recently started watching this show, and I have to say that it really made me laugh.",1
It is just Brilliant.,1
That's what t. v. should be.,1
"This show has a good sense of humour and it's fun to see a good show like this. < br / > < br / > Almost 20 years later, Ned owns a pie bakery, cleverly titled "" The Pie Hole. "" He learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight. His father took him to boarding school, and when he left, Ned never saw his father again. He brings her back to life and decides to break the rules and keep her alive. That's how they usually solve it. He first did so with his dog, Digby. When Emerson I have loved it since.",1
"< br / > < br / > I must say a word about the conventions of on - going story lines. "" In other words, it's between Ned and Chuck, who was not inclined to forgive Ned anytime soon. ( Both shows involve an "" undead "" young woman, For example. ) ( Yes, I've seen "" Amelie. "" There is always next week - - and maybe even next year. Further, about dozen episodes into the series, Ned finally did confess to Chuck that he had caused her father's death with his gift.",1
"Bravo ABC. LOST was getting old, way to revitalize prime time. 9 episodes prior to writers strike left audiences wanting more.",1
I love this show.,1
Nice movie. It is what real life can be in such an environment.,1
"But that's not all : It also manages to keep you until the end. But "" Pushing Daisies "" is more than it's parts.",1
"I think it's funniest thing on the tube since "" My Name is Earl "". Best of all, it's not a "" reality "" show. Much more enjoyable than "" Ghost Whisperer "" and "" Medium "".",1
Maybe that's a good thing. I am not sure whether his presence as narrator adds or distracts.,1
The best description ( for those in the know ) is really Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me in the best way possible. Thank god ABC picked this up instead of Fox.,1
"Wow! However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I think the characters are picture perfect and believable. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Here we go again, I thought.",1
< br / > < br / > Check it out.,1
Every time I see her on the screen I see Zooey. Very sweet pilot. Wonderfalls!!!,1
I have been a fan of Pushing Daisies since the very beginning.,1
Somehow. It's fun. I just heard a rumor that it was being canceled so I thought I'd send off a flare of good will. This show is clever.,1
"Definitely worth a look. This show is poetic, artistic and good fun. The two aunts are a delight. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults.",1
"This is her best work since "" the Last Picture Show "". If you get chance, watch it.",1
"Jim Dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show. Oh, and add the dog. Olive is the jealous but good - hearted waitress.",1
< br / > < br / > Pushing Daisies quickly made it to top of my list. What makes this show so unique is the hyper - reality it creates.,1
"The narrator made a cake out of the whole ordeal by making death seem as routine as, well, Ned ( Lee Pace ) baking pies. ). On some of the episodes, the plot line was rushed and awkward, making you ask "" what just happened? "" It definitely deserves the title of a ( romantic ) comedy / drama. But despite the awkwardness presented as they work their feelings around a strange secret which only a few know, they still manage to show their on screen chemistry in touching scenes like when Ned gives Chuck the beehives. in both the overall dead - person - of - the - week plot and in the overriding plot line. And that bringing them back to life was just as routine.",1
"And that's how this beautiful modern fairytale starts. He gave her life again and she loves him so much as he does, but this love is untouchable. Bryan Fuller, the creator, has an amazing creative mind. Till the day he could finally be close to his biggest childhood love, Chuck ( Anna Friel ), if wasn't for another sad fact : she was dead. The truly kiss of death.",1
"Nothing can ever replace Pushing Daisies, because what could ABC possibly find to replace this show? This makes every show I've ever watched look plain boring. This is easily best show on television.",1
But you know what? ... but I enjoyed this show anyway. I really liked it.,1

"Can we add a genre tag for "" so - bad - it's - good ""? ( Perhaps for sex as well, but not on Indian TV, anyway. )",1
The direction is good ( the fight scenes also ). The best film of Martial Law series.,1
His fighting incredible!,1
"Who would not want Mercedes Ruehl as an older sister? It is a rare occasion when I want to see a movie again. "" The Amati Girls "" is such a movie. One feels such a part of this family! And wanted to cheer Lee Grant as she levels criticism at Cloris Leachman's hair color. It has the aura of reality.",1
It's a great American martial arts movie. I was impressed by this film.,1
"It's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets, or better quality animation. I was particularly impressed with the heat ray. < br / > < br / > How faithful is the adaptation? Artistically, the film looks right. The only scenes shot for "" real "" seem to be those in open fields or forests.",1
"This is perhaps the least well - known and very probably the best of them. The acting is often more in the style of that period than ours. At other times, colors are washed out. Some of effects are really awkward such as the destruction of Big Ben. The year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of H. G. Wells'great novel, "" War of the Worlds "".",1
but any way i give this movie 2 thumbs up.,1
"It is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library. I will watch it for years to come, all three great hours of it. I thought that the creatures were also quite good, also considering how they were made. It isn't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow. They will explain the processes used. This film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great Czech filmmaker, Karel Zeman. They have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only. Hines took a great gamble, and I think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come.",1
I sure didn't. It's got to be seen to be believed. It was wonderful!,1

Today B - Movies have larger budgets. Nothing is changed nothing is removed.,1
It's about time.,1
"Obviously, everyone looks for different things in a movie. Mr. Hines succeeds in doing so.",1
I still think it's fairly ingenious the way Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two - part episode. You can poke holes in the plot if you want.,1

"My summation is that if you want to see a powerful, Happy, Sad, beautiful story? Or perhaps not. I cannot for the life of me understand why this film here on the IMDb only rates a 3. 9 < br / > < br / > That rating here is utterly Amazing to me. Can Scarcely Imagine a Better Movie Than This < br / > < br / > Hey, before you all go "" Chick Flick "" on me. The Acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast. This is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul.",1
"It's well produced with high production values. The characters are interesting, vibrant with primary colours and all.",1

"Nice, pleasant, and funny, but not earth - shattering.",1
I highly recommend checking out Macbeth Manhattan.,1
The ending stands out among little indies I've seen for it'closure and originality. I really enjoyed this movie.,1
"Fine soundtrack, and good performances all around.",1
"Heath Ledger is great as always and the sexy Naomi Watts charms the screen. < br / > < br / > Give this movie a chance if it airs on cable. Otherwise, I don't think I could recommend it.",1

Im a huge M Lillard fan that's why I ended up watching this movie.,1
"Wow, I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business. Matt shows his true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme.",1

"Judas'passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of Christ. When Judas takes his own life, the viewer can sense the angst. And third, is the humanity of Jesus.",1
Fantastic movie.,1
I would watch this movie again and recommend it others.,1
"Why did Pilate waffle? ) ( What motivated Judas if money was not the issue? ( The disinterested, "" just doing my job "" look on the face of the man who drives the first nail in Christ's wrist is as chilling as any moment in film. ) The film makes no claim to "" authenticity "", but the settings and costuming invariably feel more "" right "" than many more highly acclaimed efforts.",1
Loved It. This could be developed into a great Primetime Soap.,1
"Someone is going to get hurt, there's no stopping that. Love the TV show. Making the decision that you really want will be better in the end. You are in a situation were you have to choose one or the other. Making the best of what you have is a good thing a well.",1
"However, the movie needs to continue for a long time.",1
i am totally addicted to this show. it is suspenseful and exciting. i am really mean it.,1
"Also good acting by Richard Libertini, Alley Mills & Pat Hingle.",1
Eugene Levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker. Just classic stuff.,1
IT'S A MOVIE PEOPLE! !,1
"Oh, yeah, movie. It's just that good.",1
"It IS stupid, but it's stupid on purpose, and you need to remember that when you see it. And to those who just didn't get, well, I can't blame them, too much. I remember it being announced. Flaherty and Levy follow him effortlessly. No movie has ever done that to me before. D This is almost a 3 Stooges flick, except it's much funnier. When this scene came up, I laughed so hard, I peed my pants.",1
"Yeah, it's low budget.",1
"The disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reasons as us all. Once in the Life means that once a hoodlum, always a hoodlum, and nobody gets in or out of ` The Life'for free. Often times the dialog comes very fast, much faster than it would on stage, and I think it's the film's biggest flaw.",1
"I gave it a 7 / 10. It's not outstanding, but it doesn't have any really serious problems. It seemed a little forced, though.",1
"On video it's OK ). Once in the life "" is a very good movie. I rated the movie 9 / 10.",1
"Perfect dialogue without the typical clichés. This is really a great unknown movie. * * * * 1 / 2 * out of * * * * *. I loved his acting since "" King of New York "".",1
It is Mr. Fishburne'usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. All of the acting is quite good.,1
GOOD WORK!,1
Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also really good and believable.,1
"Ferdie starts licking Casper on his cheek. And the hunter and dogs are terrified of Casper. for You Tube ) ; after that I love this short, and it is one of my favorite Casper shorts. Casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with Ferdie. Poor Casper sat on a log and weep ; until a little fox cub comes up an nuzzles him.",1
"But even in death, there is still a happy ending. < br / > < br / > You have to give them credit.",1
"< br / > < br / > What is so sad about that? Both characters look overjoyed. I remember Casper comic books, but don't remember any cartoons. Did people miss the ending? It brings him to tears, until a little fox hears him bawling and befriends him.",1
"< br / > < br / > I'd give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. In fact, it's probably the saddest I've ever felt watching a cartoon.",1
"But, the plot development involving the fox ( who becomes Casper's friend, but meets a tragic end ) is a concern. < br / > < br / > THERE'S GOOD BOOS TONIGHT is a well - animated project - no doubt there.",1
"It was so depressing, I just couldn't watch it again. It's just like seeing Lassie die at end of a movie. This is the saddest one of all!",1
"But it grabbed me from the start. My choice? "" The best and most unpredictable stories are all true ones.",1
That is not what this film is.,1
"This was a gem. Irish countryside is as beautiful as ever. High recommended. Just like in the movie the Liam Cunningham's character says "" the hatred had always been there under the surface "". Story is fast - paced. It was interesting to watch the moral choices people were making in this story. The title "" Love divided "" couldn't capture it any better. Again acting is a top notch.",1
"A LOVE DIVIDED shows what happens when self appointed moral guardians take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe. What a superb movie < br / > < br / > The story starts on the day of the wedding between Sean Cloney and Sheila Kelly in the 1950s. Yet another example of "" Oireland "" and religion. No doubt we'll be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some "" hunky and macho freedom fighters "" from the IRA. Well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later I was in a state of shock. May I have the temerity to state that if Karl Marx saw this movie he'd love it and call it a masterpiece? Oh dear. This is a warning against taking pledges and not keeping to them.",1
< br / > < br / > An excellent film all round. And makes no mistake here. Definitely one of my favourite movies.,1
OH WOW. WHAT A GORGEOUS FILM! < br / > < br / > SEE THIS MOVIE.,1
"Considering it is true, it changes to a horrific tragedy. < br / > < br / > Special note should be given to Orla Brady who plays Sheila. There is no sign of any animosity between the Catholics and Protestants in the village.",1
"I believe that the film does a good job in showing this struggle in both the church and the family. Unfortunately not everything in life, including religion, are all nice and rosy. In this case both let this family down.",1
I really like this show.,1
Way better than niece. Awful. She was an awesome actress.,1
C'mon man! The one bad thing is the title. Really? George Lopez?,1
There is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes. < br / > < br / > George Lopez is funny. Now there's a bad sitcom...,1
nah but he can be really good too. funny show! ha ha george does have big head!,1
"It was dark, dramatic and gripping.",1
"Still funny. Funny, talented, funny, spectacular.",1
This makes both him & the shows progressively funnier. George Lopez is a funny man even without the sitcom. No one on the cast is really safe from his wit now. His wife's dad is getting more & more involved in plot.,1
"¡ Gracias, Señor Lopez!",1
"The film notes describe the main role family, as Turkish immigrants which living in Denmark.",1
I will stop here to avoid the spoiler.,1
"It's a rather good movie, but too Americanised in it's predictability.",1
< br / > < br / > I think this movie deserves a broader audience than it has received.,1
"When you are in a gloomy or depressed mood, go watch this film.",1
"But this movie is a dramatic powerhouse. Theoretically a coming of age story of a teenage Turkish girl living in Copenhagen, Denmark. So what have we? When I took my seat in the cinema I was in a cool mood and didn't plan on changing it. I was all in sweat and needed a shower afterward.",1
< br / > < br / > Well worth your while. A beautiful and touching movie that deserves a wider viewing than it is likely to get.,1
"The direction is competent and assured. Other than that, just don't see it. It's not bad, but it's really not very good. The story is plodding.",1
"Branaugh is one heck of an actor. His soliloquies were breathtaking. Um how you say "" two thumbs up "". Hamlet is by far my favorite of all of Shakespeare's works. This leaves no stone unturned.",1
"Kenneth Branagh's "" Hamlet "" hits all the marks. Oh yeah - the screenplay, by some guy named Will S., isn't too bad either. I can't think of many better ways to make four hours fly by.",1
"Well, she certainly eradicated all doubts with her performance. I didn't know what to expect really. < br / > < br / > The setting of the play in the 19th century gives a welcome change to the usually gloomier Gothic settings. Nevertheless, I'll give it a go. She is the best Ophelia I have seen and lent such depth to the character and was simply wonderful.",1
I doubt you'll find a better Polonius than Richard Briers'delicious portrayal. William Shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play. I guess they know good writing when they see it though. Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is simply genius. How he wasn't nominated for an Oscar is a total mystery.,1
One of the best movie - dramas I have ever seen. There are several scenes of note.,1
"Julie Christie as Gertrude is surely one of the best ever, and even American actors are astounding, esp. A lot of people don't think Branagh's Hamlet film is all that good, but I must admit I think it is splendid. All right, so Branagh is a mite too old for the title role. ! Jack Lemmon ). And he gets too hysterical at times. For that, one must delve into the print versions of the plays. Of course it may not be true, but it's a funny story - and if true, a This is the biggest problem with this production. But that's it. The thing about the "" secret doors everywhere "", for instance, simply doesn't work. And the relationship with Ophelia seems a little forced.",1
"It is his charisma, power and command of the role that defines movie. The only gloom comes from Hamlet himself, as it should. Well worth your time, all four hours of it. And the cast is incredible, Brannagh the brightest star.",1
Astounding. Every frame is a painting. A mesmerizing piece.,1
"So Columbia if you're listening put this film out the way it should be watched! And I don't know what happened at the Oscars. I own a DVD player, and I'd take this over Titanic any day. Branagh doesn't play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for this. I went to see Hamlet because I was in between jobs. What films were they watching? Like other reviews the 4 hours passes swiftly.",1
"I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. Well, I couldn't and so, I rented this mess of a movie.",1
It blew my mind.,1
< br / > < br / > That's my two cents. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and King. You don't need to be affluent with Shakespeare to relate to all the Misery hamlet has to go through. I would recommend this movie to a wide audience.,1
"< br / > < br / > The rest of cast is top - notch as well. school. Olivier at least did it without being self - indulgent about it, but Gibson and, from what I saw, Williamson, looked like they went to the "" Look, Ma, I'm acting! Seemed like overkill to me. I'm acting! "" But upon further reading, I grew to really appreciate the play. This was my favorite performance of the year by far.",1
"Wow. The language is awesome and passionate. It was an event. What was being said. Powerful. < br / > < br / > Second, it was 4 hours long! But lo and behold... when performed, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life.",1
"It was filmed at Blenheim Palace, possibly England's most grandiose stately home, but also a rather forbidding one. The look of the film is particularly striking, both sumptuous and chilly. ( There is a contrast here with Zeffirelli's film, where both the interiors and the costumes were deliberately subdued in tone ). "".",1
"< br / > < br / Thus "" Hamlet "" loses its impact as it loses its grip. The acting prize though must go to one of the great thespian discoveries of recent years, Kate Winslet. Branagh has taken on three huge mantels, adapting, directing and playing. Watching this film holds a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have garnered from it. "" Hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair, Ophelia. Two entirely separate sittings would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making. Too many of them outstay their welcome. And of course : "" To be or not to be "".",1
"Everyone knows the story, so I will not spend much time on that. All play their parts equally well. Whatever the reason, this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching "" Hamlet. "" < br / > < br / > The film is top - heavy with film stars, although most have mere bit parts. That is not a question that I can answer. Branagh nailed it. That being said, I have no doubt that had he been able to see it, Bard would have been overjoyed with Branagh's production.",1
"best - ever! "" And its also crippled down to 4 : 3 aspect ratio. - reviews make some people turn away ( including me ).",1
"I hope that people will watch this movie get interested as I have. Also that that is how people remember them, from their armor.",1
"First, what I didn't like. If they see this film they will understand clearly at least one man's interpretation of the play. The acting was not really up to the Hamlet standard. Some people are complaining that "" it's set in the 19th century and that wasn't Shakespeare's time "". Branagh was really over - the - top, doing a lot of yelling mostly. For example, in King John the English and French have cannons - - in Robin Hood's day. A lot of the ambiguities in the play were clearly resolved one way in the flashbacks.",1
"< br / > < br / > The set pieces, too, are often quite stunning, giving a refreshing change to the danky old castle corridors we're used to seeing in Shakespeare productions, as well as a real sense of country around them. Kenneth Branagh excels as Hamlet, bringing not only the confusion and pain required to the roll, but also a sort of sardonic air which plays beautifully in the comic scenes, making the movie as a whole much more watchable. The other major players are also good, but it is Kenneth Branagh who stands head and shoulders above the rest in the title role. However, I watched and, much to my disturbance, found myself not only paying attention, but actually enjoying the movie too. < br / > < br / > The main stars, of course, are also wonderful.",1
"It is a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding. < br / > < br / > This is a must see for everyone who enjoy's good story telling, brilliant acting, and incredible direction. All of these part of William Shakespeares greatest triumph. Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli, and Almerayeda have all directed Hamlet but Branagh's the only one who got it right.",1
"Branagh's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise. In return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves, a fair enough proposition and one that's a bargain. In his portrayal of Hamlet here he might be accused of that again, but there is a method at work. The direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play. Since so much of'Hamlet'is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels, battles, etc., this can be a daunting task.",1
Branagh is phenomenal in the leading role. Every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction.,1
"D to understand and enjoy it. I must say that, looking at Hamlet from the perspective of a student, Brannagh's version of Hamlet is by far the best. His dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded. It is presented in a way that one does not have to be an English Literature Ph.",1
Hugh is smitten. Nevermind. He convinces Aggie to become his fiancé.,1
"Perhaps also the film could've gone longer, to cover more of the Kelly Gang's / Ned's life - I felt not enough was covered. Orlando Bloom was fantastic as Joe, playing the role of quiet, loyal ladiesman very well. ( Great job, Heath! ) < br / > < br / > Regardless of a few flaws, this is a moving film, which stirs all sorts of emotions.",1
"As the couple's weak relationship falls apart, a larger story plays out in the background.",1
Good ones. These guys make films.,1
This series easily adds to the excellent comedies being produced! this is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen. if you like keeping up appearances it probably isn't. it's so silly it's genius. There are so many funny sketches. if you like twisted black comedy then this is for you.,1
"Bloody Thatcher "" possibly shared with most of us.",1
The Christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for Christmas. After that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the BBC have ever made!,1
"A weird, witty and wonderful depiction of family life! Of course the show is also incredibly funny, and is a guaranteed to make you smile. Veoh. com is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in shops.",1
certainly not! Predictable?,1
"The movie rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after jumping about quite a bit. Lee - Hom Wang also shines as the vengeful'Son'who becomes friends with a grown - up Sho. And that is exactly what'Moon Child'is, and more. The superstars as actors have their flaws, and so do their characters. < br / > < br / > HYDE as the somber vampire'Kei'is excellent, giving depth to the character and balancing - out the overly - zealous acting of Gackt as'Sho,'an orphan who befriends Kei.",1
"Shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it. It's just a movie with a vampire in it. Toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics. < br / > < br / > On a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising.",1
This film was amazing.,1
"Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, who is seen for a split second looks fantastic.",1
"it was Taro Yamamoto, boy # 5 from battle Royale! besides one great heck of a fan service for fan girls ( well, that was redundant ~ ), it was the story that blew me away. and Gackt wasn't at all that bad too, i preferred how his character was kind of aloof from the start. ... would probably be the best word to describe this film ( in my opinion ). hurray for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt!",1
"I'm a fan of both actors / singers especially Gackt and when I first discover this movie and watch the trailer, I just think this is a silly one.",1
"It is a drama about friendship and loyalty! But "" Moon Child "" isn't an action movie! Sounds promising and interesting! But it just is! This movie surprised me!",1
I am extremely picky about the films I see. < br / > < br / > Man..,1
"^ _ ~ If you are Gackt and Hyde fans, you have to see. I think that it's a really good movie to watch.",1
It's a good film with a touchy story inside. Several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad.,1
The sparks that came out of the guns appeared too fake and I think that could have been eliminated or fixed. Moon Child was one of the more symbolic movies I've seen.,1
"Moonchild is a very difficult movie to categorise. Which, I suppose, brings me to the lead actors. < br / > < br / > The other area that really stood out to me is the languages. It's easiest to think of it as several snapshots of the lives of the two central characters.",1
"The plot was just... wow. < br / > < br / > It's a sad movie, but not sappy. This movie is amazing.",1
"Vampires, sexy guys, guns and some blood.",1
"Some location shooting film in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballara.",1
< br / > < br / > And you will never see a more beautiful sunrise. Tragedy claims still others.,1
The story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along. I just wanted to check it out. Right?? < br / > < br / > It's worth seeing more than once. < br / > < br / > Wrong!!,1
"I was not disappointed. Moon Child has just the right amount of humour, action, romance and serious, heart - wrenching moments. In fact, this film greatly exceeded my expectations.",1
A lot of angst. The music is also amazing. Beautifully done.,1
The role fits him. DON'T MISS IT!,1
"Hyde did an amazing job for a first timer. It also explains that Sho and Son have become enemies. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with Son's sister, Yi - Che.",1
"The way they met up was quite cool indeed. Regardless of what some might've thought, I see Kei as a fatherly figure to Sho.",1
"All in all, if you're a fan of any of the actors or just a j - film fan, it's definitely worth a watch. He's one of my two major beefs with the film itself. Dreading it. That sort of thing? I was very, very pleasantly surprised.",1
"This is, by all categories, the best movie I have ever seen. Here, he meets Sho, an orphan living on the street. < br / > < br / > This is must see. All in their original languages, of course!",1
"It's a very beautiful movie. They're making new friend, life - friends.",1
such was Ned's Bravery. ' < br / > < br / > The Jerilderie Letter is more than what has been stated before.,1
"So, give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler wasn't the best at first either.",1
"Came up with nothing. You can tell what side I'm on with Moon Child. I mean, the synopsis sounded really out there.",1
"I must admit, at first I wasn't expecting anything good, at all. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.",1
"At least rent it since it's coming to Region 1. After a few months, I figured I guess it's for real. I didn't even see much of subtext.",1
The characters all had human traits. I give this movie two thumbs so far up. Definitely best movie I have seen in the past five years.,1
"However, with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day. < br / > < br / > Overall, a great addition that was very refreshing. Pro Skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems too their limits.",1
"In Story Mode, your going from punk to pro. It's awesome! 9 / 10. You can create the goal pedestrian and write what they speak.",1
"As I said.. it gets no better. This is what I call a "" pre Sci Fi ; Sci Fi "" movie. These two genuine artists are at their very best, as is the story line. No way. < br / > < br / > This is sort of motion picture that begs for a remake.",1
I disagree. !,1
"The contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark. Meanwhile Rukh becomes contaminated by Radium X to the point that anyone he touches will die instantly. Diana and Ronald accompany him. The Invisible Ray "" is part science fiction and part horror. < br / > < br / > Rukh goes to Benet for help.",1
You must watch this movie!,1
Pretty good special effects.,1
"Karloff slightly overdoes his performance but Lugosi is terrific. The film lacks pace, but is always absorbing. And even a touch of James Whale in a cockney landlady in Paris!",1
"The rest of the performances are also good, if not particularly worth mentioning. Frances Drake makes a very good female lead in her role of Dr Rukh's beautiful young wife.",1
"Acting is mostly fine, with Karloff & Lugosi being very good. Recommended, much like ALL old Universal horrors...",1
Still I did like this. The plot is just too far - fetched for me to swallow.,1
The film does get off to a rather slow start ; but things soon start to pick up. Karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for Karloff to impress with.,1
!,1
"I think this is the best part I remember seeing him in. I guess that ’ s mark of a good piece of art. Lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed. No skimping on the loads of extras and locations. A grade A effort by Universal. The script is well done, imaginative, and without fault.",1
"This light can do harm, or it can be harnessed to do good. shouts a young girl on whose eyes this light is projected ).",1
"The more the stories try to portray Kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention. < br / > < br / > Heath Ledger does an amazing job of impersonating Australia's most notorious outlaw. No, I am not making that up. The story of Ned Kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand, and this film is no exception. About the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the Irish versus English mentality of the battles.",1
"< br / > < br / > This film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films. However, despite this unusual twist, the two still did excellent jobs. ). However, over the course of the film, Rukh turns out to be right and Benet is especially generous in his new praise for Rukh. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet - - whose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds French.",1
"Their The Invisible Ray "" features three main chapters. This actually would have been a great title for the Boris Karloff collection instead!",1
Universal kept the public unaware of the special effects being used in this great classic film. Dr. Benet ( Bela Lugosi ) form an expedition led by Rukh to locate the element.,1
"In "" The Raven "" Lugosi is a sadistic surgeon, who blackmails Karloff to assist his evil plans until Karloff finally has had enough. < br / > < br / > What he gets is a disaster. Rarely are they both negative characters totally. In "" The Body Snatcher "", Karloff does kill Lugosi, but Lugosi is trying to blackmail him.",1
"In the same way, Boris Karloff's performance in James Whale's "" Frankenstein "" transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster. Of course, it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen, and the movie that united them was 1934's "" The Black Cat "".",1
"The acting is marvelous and science is amusing. I highly recommend it. It is hard, however to hear his accent and believe he is French.",1
For a movie made in 1936 the sci - fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time. What I'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot.,1
"But no can forget it. And what I see frightens me. """,1
"Karloff and Lugosi - Together again! Lugosi hesitatingly replies, in a way that only Lugosi could deliver, "" They die "". Same here. There isn't any real transformation. But, it is very worthy of both's talents and is a fun film when re - visited.",1
The movie is based on a french play and brings all the best qualities of that farce.,1
< br / > < br / > The movie tells the story of Ned Kelly's life. They start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days. I really enjoyed this movie and I give it a 7.,1
"This almost unknown gem was based on a French farce - - which shows, and I mean that as a compliment.",1
Robert Wagner played his role good. Fatal Error is a really cool movie! The movie's cast all acted really well.,1
It was interesting to say the least. The movie wasn't all that great. The book is better. Overall I'd give the movie a 7 or 8. But the movie wasn't all that bad either.,1
"< br / > < br / > watch it. It'really good, no really, it is! the acting in it and the plot was just so great.",1
"Actually, I have to say there all my favourite. I love the show it's great for kids and adults, OK, everybody. When I was little it was Bugs of course, and Porky Pig. Pepe is cool, I always loved him. This show brings back a lot of memories, happy ones.",1
< br > < br / > A classic. Maybe it IS love? We're still together. Bank on it. Red was the best thing in this film.,1
"And there's some nice touches of humor like that of Brando's head hitting the top of Button's and Umeki's inside doorway more than once. Red and Miyoshi themselves deserve their Oscars especially Red with his defiant and proud emotions throughout. Bailey himself is dating one of the dancers, Fumiko - San ( Reiko Kuba ).",1
"It certainly inspired me to look more closely. It is interesting to note, that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what, and how they only said so many lines. I feel that in this case, this is the only limitation. For me, I'd call it a breath of fresh air! It is also wonderful to see something Australian! Maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an Australian audience? So, watch it and decide for yourself. There are few films that leave me with the feeling that Gregor Jordan's'Ned Kelly'film did.",1
"Sayonara "" will make you laugh and cry.",1
This movie highlights prejudices and cultural differences of that time.,1
"Although, some attack Brando's accent, he is at his near best in nuance and characterization. However, when judged from the prospective of 1925 America, he was fantastic. This is one of the greatest love story movies I have ever seen. It portrays true love and passion, and not just "" heat. """,1
"Anyone who has been in Japan would understand. The same way MASH was a subtle criticism of the Viet Nam war? Any thoughts? The Jim Crow laws were still in effect. Civil Rights was in it's infancy. There were strict social rules, especially for men meeting single women. When this movie was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the South.",1
"Do so, and fall love.",1
A mostly underrated gem. < br / > < br / > This movie manages to say SOMETHING and be entertaining at the same time.,1
They presume to KNOW what's best for Buttons and Umeki. But the picture is stolen by the orientals here. < br / > < br / > Sayonara is a relevant film today. Miko Taka hits the mark beautifully as Brando's love interest. Today gays in the military is a big issue.,1
That all changes as the movie goes along.,1
!,1
"I enjoyed it. I don't think Ganghis Kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact. In spite of the efforts of governments and some historians, Ned Kelly has become a legend.",1
The tag line holds true as well.,1
? So simple isn't it?,1
Other than that I give it two thumbs / tails up! Those dogs ( Jerry Lee and Zeus ) must have had A lot of training. She died before this movie but how?,1
"This has been played so often that it's starting to skip ; no joke! But of course you'll have that when you own a film so charming, so brilliant. Poppycock, I say.",1
"< br / > < br / > If you are expecting more of the same from the first movie, you will be disappointed, but this is still a good movie.",1
"Forgivable - keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book. < br / > < br / > The film is a little unevenly paced. I was particularly impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed. The script is intelligent and economical. A day later, strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for Superman than Clark Kent.",1
"< br / > < br / > Give Blood Today God Bless! That doesn't stop me from enjoying this film, it has a lot going for it.",1
The old style special effects and sound - the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology. < br / > < br / > It's just so wonderful and fun to view.,1
Can Superman change the people's ways in time to save the mole men? A must see for anyone.,1
Usual acting in these type movies leaves a lot to be desired. John Brambury was also a Munchkin. Some of the mole men were famous too. But as a kid I enjoyed it.,1
"Rose was really in love with Jimmy's good friend happy go lucky Fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her. * * * SPOILERS * * * All too, in real life as well as in the movies, familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun, or rifle, in their hands.

"don't take my word for it, investigate for yourselves. to mention a few.",1

The people Tagge represents are never revealed. The allusions to J. F. K.'s killing are unmistakable. ). The script has enough plot holes to make you want to read the book ( neat trick that! I prefer right - wing ones myself - they are funnier!,1
"The "" director "" must be just trigger. This is a great movie. This is the clue! All can be done just by delegation. There is no special agency involved in the plot. This is a PRIVATE plot, built as a PRIVATE enterprise.",1
"He's a clown, but he has a special talent. It's a good offbeat film. < br / > < br / > So does Wallace.",1
"So, Wallace steps in and the fun begins. Brother vs. brother... fighting fire with fire! Vida's house arrest sees its end, but Wilder is preoccupied.",1
That seems impossible to say least. The fight between the brothers near the end of the movie was brilliant though.,1
It's a good one at that. It reminds me a lot of Being John Malkovich.,1
The soundtrack is great also.,1
"I think you can figure the rest out. Later on when Tracy is reported missing in action, Tone and George marry. He's learned to shoot by now and he does a Sergeant York.",1
"< br / > < br / > One thing in particular about the movie that impressed me was it's use of music, which plays a large part. The people who are bad - mouthing this film are those who don't understand film to begin with.",1

Wow!,1
"In the ten years since Wildside aired, nothing has really come close to its quality in local production. < br / > < br / > A great series which has aged remarkably well. Here's hoping the ABC's DVD department gets its act together. < br / > < br / > Wildside is currently being repeated late at night on the ABC.",1
I was amazed at her performance. A great message lies within film. Release it so all can enjoy!,1

"The Lion King 1 1 / 2 is a very cute story to go along with The Lion King. This story is still an original plot. In the movie, e vents are explained by a different characters point of view. Timon and Pumbaa travel along looking for ideal place to live.",1
After watching the 1 1 / 2 i was like wow. I was like ok there we go again.,1
"< br / > < br / > The voice talents are excellent. But there is nothing about it that would give you the same sort of feeling that The Lion King did. My favorite part is when they show the pair raising Simba. They could have easily fit a commentary, or another aspect ratio on the 1st disc. Some of the questions are actually difficult.",1
"It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg reprising their roles. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but he is ably supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. We find out what made Timon and Pumbaa decide to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to oust Scar. Having said that, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie. And we find out how they dealt with the hyena's once and for all.",1
"1 1 / 2 "" decides to try something different : It tells the original story from a new point of view. 10 / 10 After fighting over the remote, Timon and Pumbaa decide to tell the audience "" their story "". Everyone does well, especially Robert Guillame ( is that how you spell it? ) They start the new movie, and the laughs begin.",1
"The rest, you already know. Disney have done it again.",1
"Of course that's a good thing. < br / > < br / > However some parts don't fit. Everyone, my name may sound weird, but there was nothing else! Walt Disney company has NOT lost his touch maybe not for this one. In this movie, they are not!",1
< br / > < br / > Ups : Songs again.,1
This film even goes back to before Simba and ( presumbably ) just after the birth of Kiara. : ),1
Surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of Disney's straight to video throw away sequels.,1
"The score is quite good. < br / > < br / > 3. The friendship between Timon and Pumbaa are touchingly portrayed. During the climax, some of the jokes becomes lame. Many of scenes from the first film are used in this one. Lion King 1 1 / 2 "" is the funniest non - theatrical release from Disney. Yes, there is.",1
"Seriously, did you expect anything else in a film where Pumbaa takes centre stage? It's not what happens, it's how. Why,'The Lion King'of course! < br / > < br / > The music is also great. Which classic tale, you ask?",1
Disney was smart to cast Stiller in that role! It's got a good story and is very funney! 10 out of 10!,1
It was a very good movie over all. It was very funny. I was wrong. I found it to be very good.,1
"But this was no problem, it had subtitles. As do the other actors, who mostly consist of people in their 50's and beyond. It's all good. It's a special purpose sub. I've got a fetish for German subs, especially wrecks that can be dived upon. The team has done some serious research.",1
"It's a fun flick with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first. It means no worries! Sit back and just think Hakuna Matata! So, hopefully, I'll get the same with the third installment to Lion King series.",1
"They also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with warthog. The sing, they entertain, and they make us laugh. Disney has advertised 1 and a half as "" the rest of the story, "" though it really isn't.",1
"Of course usual Disney elements and themes are here, friendship, good versus evil etc. On the way he meets Pumba, another outcast and they become friends.",1
"It's all harmless fun, good for kids and some adults. The jacuzzi bubble, and when Pumba leaves, the bubbles stop.",1
"The newer, independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original. The toe - tapping opening feature of'Dig A Tunnel'is well choreographed and hilarious. The voice talents are all well performed, though I couldn't help thinking of Marge Simpson every time I heard Julie Kavner. < br / > < br / > Overall, worth purchasing. Lion King 1 1 / 2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. This is done with frequent comedic interruptions. Timon and Pumba's take on the Lion King's opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing.",1
"It's kinda like MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa. Maybe not now, but go watch it for yourself. < br / > < br / > Video movie rating : * * * 1 / 2 out of 5. We get to see them make fun of the events in the first film. < br > < br / > So doesn't this sound fun. Surprisingly amusing. My Take : A funny take on THE LION KING, posing as a sequel.",1
The scenes never seem out of place. It deserved a theatrical release. The same can be said for this movie.,1
"No painfully corny moments, which was a blessing for me. ).",1
One of the best movies for all ages.,1
"I don't think many kids are really concerned about Disney's profit margin on direct - to - video movies. ) < br / > < br / > The Lion King 1½ definitely has its cute and funny moments. Most of the time, I found myself embracing the latter. At least LK2 had the nice ballad, "" Love Will Find a Way. "" As for the voicework, it was well done in this movie. People just love these characters!",1
"This was a strong Poirot / Suchet, television mystery selection. Lemon is in middle. Japp was nothing special but for me did not distract from story. The characters were vivid and well - acted.",1
This is not a movie to be missed.,1
Rocky Green Eyes is a great movie.,1
Truly this is a'heart - warming'film. I won't'spoil'this movie for you. One of my friends said it was her favorite movie.,1
com I would really appreciate it. I have been searching for it every where. I was right.,1
All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. Winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart warming portrayal of a man lost by his memories. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.,1
No movies have grabbed my attention like this one has. Rating reflects movie content.,1
"This movie is to show what those "" genius "" people very often think and what problems they face. And what'even more boring?",1
This movie can be interpreted on many different levels. One of the best movies I have ever seen. Why?,1
"One brother, a self - proclaimed genius played by James Franco is your typical sensitive but intelligent man - child.",1
"I waited several weeks to watch this, and I was not disappointed.",1
"And the students had great personalities and well developed on whole, particularly Damian Lewis as Leonard. 7. All in all, solid mystery but doesn't rank along the best. Hickory Dickory Dock was a good Poirot mystery.",1
Just watch it!,1
The movie is better than the book. That's right.,1
"Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. There's an easy answer to that : modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. R. I. P. Stanley. < br / > < br / > So, the plot is fairly simple.",1
"Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are "" intruders "" in the hotel. At this point, we know something is going to happen, but don't know when and how. The ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute. They are not alone in this place.",1
"Not really. So go on Netflix, and get it! The kid is psychic. It really is great. ! Well, the house is haunted. Not just the classic, "" Here's Johnny "" scene.",1
"Therefore the Overlook becomes the new home of the Torrance family : Jack, his wife Wendy ( Shelley Duvall ) and their five - year old son Danny ( Danny Lloyd ). This is due to two factors : Stanley Kubrick's masterful direction and Jack Nicholson's chilly acting.",1
"We're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening. From then on, all bets are off. He's calm, quiet, patient. It's one of the few films where I can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it. At times, this overtakes The Thing as my favourite horror film. I disagree. It's the destruction of Jack Torrence. But it's the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared. He becomes irritable, angry, on edge.",1
"This is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so. < br / > < br / > In conclusion, this is the cornerstone of horror and tension. He loves to perplex his watchers everyone of his films. Nothin '. Red is used in EVERY scene. < br / > < br / > I will be talking about this film for months to come. Then the father ( Jack ) becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel. It has infinite depth.",1
A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad.,1
Ullman tells Jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh Winter sets in. The pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long & keeps you interested throughout.,1
"It's up to Poirot to bring a killer to justice. Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd standout among the group. It's a fun little play on the Hickory Dickory Dock title. It's just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked. In fact, the entire plot of Hickory Dickory Dock could have been used in a Giallo.",1
Jack Nicholson gives an awesome performance.,1
"Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic. If you want a great viewing experience, then this is an example that well and truly shines... When he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. ...",1
< br Kubrick's genius is like magic. < br / > < br / > The Hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. The movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999. *!!,1
"A red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in slow motion. Heck, even King himself didn't fare so bad. < br / > < br / > Kubrick's miss - en - scene is, as usually, terrific. And of course, the bathroom scene.",1
And it has what horror movies usually lack : a great script.,1
"Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237. Who could forget that chilling ending? ""? Seeing this, Wendy thinks Jack has been abusing Danny. The Shining, you know what's weird about this movie?",1
"), as well as his flawless delivery of several now - famous lines ( ` Heeeeeere's Johnny!!'). It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest.",1
"After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. I was never a big fan of horror movies. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well - acted, and had a great story. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk - in refrigerator. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore.",1
"The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.",1
At the same time it manages to invoke intense emotions of sadness and despair.,1
"< br / > < br / > Humour was much more prevalent in these early Poirots. Altogether though, a solid entry in the series though not one of best. This story was never among my favourites in Christie's works so I was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation.",1
Chrissy Dunn ( Danielle Cormack ) is a drop - out. I loved the sparring between Jen and Lyn. She is also nearing 40 and desparate for a child.,1

We also have to struggle against racism and fascim. Sometimes a miracle happens. Enjoy. Sophie's choice "" with Meryl Streep.",1
"Anyway, this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points. But it's GOOD crap. She seems to exist in a state of deja vu. Shots of Berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place, so that adds to the atmosphere.",1

"I certainly didn't expect to find "" Necronomicon "" that great : its beginning didn't impress me at all. Franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera. I haven't seen all of Jess Franco's movies, I have seen 5, I think, and there are more than 180 of them. But then I stumbled on this movie. Since that moment Franco never could grip me that much. We find out he can do a lot. It is even better than "" Vampiros Lesbos "", I think.",1

"As in other movies of this kind, it's also commendable that it's as much a portrait of female empowerment as it is pure exploitation. I also enjoyed a bank robbery scene gone haywire and a carjacking scene that was simply uproarious.",1
Won't it ever air again? Sob. I want to see it all again. I want to buy it.,1
"It did not suffer for that, however - the dialog was witty and the action was high. I am eagerly awaiting its availability on DVD! Wonderful memories.",1
MacGyver first aired about 3 years later.,1
"Unfortunately at the time we had no VCR, so i haven't ever seen the series again.",1

Brooks directs with a lot of verve and uses several interesting transitions between scenes.,1
IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. ) The landmark photography is by the great Conrad Hall.,1
"Add another classic score from Quincey Jones, and you have a masterpiece. In Cold Blood "" hasn't lost an ounce of its power. The acting from the two leads is terrific. ( 9 / 10 ) Its exceptionally well made yet forces the viewer to think. To be honest, I'm not sure if I agree with the film's central message, but I admire its audacity nonetheless.",1
"The rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth remarking on. Brooks turns killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them. < br / > < br / > Unlike so many other crime films, this one doesn't glamorize violence.",1
"Why Wilson didn't go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me. < br / > < br / > This is a solid movie, scary every time you see. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie. The movie was filmed in the actual Clutter house which had been sold to another person after the murders.",1
Highly recommended! Simply one of the best ever! John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. 10 out of 10. Go Figure!,1
The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith.,1
Loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager. I want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film. Looking forward to the next films - - - when? Many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter. were very realistic. Whidbey Too bad there have to be commercials. Thank you!,1
It really brought to life the excellent acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I've only seen this a couple times since. Music from Quincy Jones effectively scores it's story. It was too real.,1
What a chilling and tremendous film. I agree!,1
"The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD. Given the overall power of film, however, this becomes a trivial annoyance. < br / > < br / > GFT, Amazon Reviewer Strong stuff - - and recommended. As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less fine. This is the film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests, and deservedly so. < br / > < br / > The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself.",1
"However, this incident takes place in 1959! ! In Cold Blood "" centers on the element of unexplained... This dreadful revelation sideswiped us, and mired the nation into a tailspin of conflicting ethics!! The situational diatribes which Hickock and Smith lamented about were always ambiguous!!",1
"< br / > < br / > Robert Blake walks away with the film. Easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century. Dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime, only irritation at Perry's.",1
"These aren't good people, but they aren't necessarily monsters either, at least all the way through. You feel somehow for these criminals, who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of B - movie. The story ended in 1965.",1
"Acting, script, Quincy Jones'score, cinematography, editing, etc. Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing. - - just fantastic. I've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity ; and I've seen most of the crime classics going way back. Watch Dick and They seem so real. < br / > < br / > The cops are wonderful too. Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great as well. A unique film... one of the best of all time.",1
"< br / > < br / > Don't miss this brilliant movie. To me, this is what great film - making is all about. Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition.",1
I don't think I could watch that again..... once is plenty. His breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap.,1
Great job by each of them. Jeff Corey is marvelous as Mr. Hickock. Robert Blake is excellent as Perry. Those darker moments are the most haunting ones. There is much to remember from this film. Then the hanging scene.,1
"It was a very fitting end for Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! I am so looking forward to her future projects.",1
See it on DVD. Famed photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on this.,1
"This lack of balance comes from the book as Capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row. As I have matured, my fascination with the Academy Awards has evolved from intense interest to casual amusement. As a child star, Blake sold the lottery ticket to Bogart in that John Huston film. ) Scott Wilson is all cold charm and Robert Blake intense introversion as the two killers. While there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen, the film is definitely adult material. However, whatever feelings one may have for or against capital punishment, "" In Cold Blood "" will leave The performances are fine as well. The Clutter family was apparently not researched to the same depth.",1
"These two truly enhance each other. I'd suggest watching CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well.",1
"Many of the stills from this film of the Kansas farm house at night or the tree - lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography. Most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall ( later of "" American Beauty "" and "" Road to Perdition "" fame ). Second, the recent Oscar winning biopic, "" Capote "" showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author, Truman Capote. It's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting, superb writing, flawless direction, and haunting photography. < br / > < br / > As a stand alone film from it's era, "" In Cold Blood "" is top notch in every way. The flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done. First, and most chillingly, is the fact that it's star, Robert Blake, was recently on trial for murdering his wife. These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience. I dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down Robert Blake's pallid face in lieu of actual tears.",1
"< br / > < br / > An interesting, and maybe the first, look at capital punishment, and what ends we hope to achieve. They push each other along a road of "" proving "" something to each other. in this instance, these needs carried right through to the murder of the Clutters. The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of Hickok and Smith.",1
"It excels in every department. Blake and Wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo. I've seen a great many films, but'In Cold Blood'stands alone in a class by itself.",1
"But this is no dream. But it's a fool's life, and two outlaws soon regret their actions. It's the stuff of nightmares. There's no need to lock the doors. Sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway. The events really happened, in 1959. Moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room.",1
"Although it was released way back in 1967, IN COLD BLOOD still remains the benchmark by which all true - crime films are matched. We don't see that much blood being spilled in these scenes, but we don't need to. Only during the ride back to Kansas, when Blake is questioned by Forsythe and narrates the story, do we see the true horror of what happened that night. Two months on the run, including an aimless "" vacation "" in northern Mexico, ended in Las Vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car. But it eventually comes out, after merciless grilling by Kansas law enforcement officials, that these two men committed that heinous crime in Holcomb.",1

A real must have in any serious videoteque.,1

The film is as good as Forrest Gump in my belief.,1
It is a touching film for good natured souls.,1
It's only when we love that we're truly alive. I'm quite a cynic. I cry even as I write this and it was quite some time since I saw it. This movie has some kliches but I really don't care.,1

But Georges can't be shaken off.",1
"Better still, buy this movie. If you haven't seen it, there's only one thing to do. But it is matched by the brilliant Pascal Duquenne as Georges. It's quirky, visually inventive, exhilarating and emotionally challenging storytelling. This is not done in a patronising way but with a great sense of fun and also honesty. This is the French and Belgians doing what they do best.",1
"Is it a drama? However, this does not detract from the whole. Is it a comedy? This film is a monument.",1

"< br / > < br / > Finally this film belongs to Gregory Peck who wonderful as King David. David is not satisfied with Nathan's answer, ( to paraphrase ) that no one can understand the will of God. But it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves. The path tread in this film could have been very hokey, but King keeps it real and interesting all the way. The best thing about it is that it does not diminish them in the eyes of the viewer. From the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction. Hayward is at her best in this film. < br / > < br / > Raymond Massey does a great job as Nathan the prophet.",1
The production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game.,1

But his eyes catch sight of Bathsheba out in her garden one evening. I liked Kieron Moore's performance as Uriah is one of David's army captains. He even lays hands on the Ark of the Covenant which was an instant death as seen in film.",1
"He even tries the old "" My kingdom doesn't understand me "" routine on desperate housewife Bathsheba at one point. And somehow I doubt a bored David ever told the prophet Nathan "" Whatever you say. "" So it's probably a tribute to Henry King's direction that the film isn't at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide. Maybe it's the censor - baiting nature of the plot a married man kills a femme fatale's husband and gets away with it!",1

"Or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed? The flavorsome, harmonic score by Pray for Rain likewise hits the spot. Walt Lloyd's sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look.

It might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others. It remains the sum of its parts. The shorts don't exactly relate but they all have something in common, love.

It ran from 1959 - 1973. Its appeal was across generations. < br / > < br / > I remember repeats of this series.,1
"It's prime for youtube, I tell ya! I love this show and my 11 year - old daughter and I LOVE watching it together. Well, the swatch lined up perfectly and the mystery was solved. Yes.",1
"For 1859, the weapons and clothes are, for the most part, not authentic. < br / > < br / > There are other time - line problems. Mark Twain was 24 years - old in 1859. My comment is limited generally to the first season, 1959 - 60. In time, the killing was reduced. There are continuity problems, over and over. That's basically a nitpick.",1

"Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name. People have relationships, some go good, some not so good, it's just life. But that's if Bonanza were done today. < br / > < br / > The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution. I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys.",1
"When I was born, this television series was the number one show on T. ! ! Certainly, my entire family loved "" Bonanza ""! Western Movies were so popular that Western Television Shows followed suit!! The breathtaking cinematography of Lake Tahoe symbolized an infinite prosperity of the emerging American culture!!",1
"The characters are all very well drawn. The youngest, Little Joe, is a hot headed, handsome charmer who, by contrast, has quite a way with women. Bonanza is still infinitely re watchable in re runs. Also, trips away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so forth. These three brothers have different mothers, all of whom have passed away years earlier. They are involved in various town affairs, even the political life of the Nevada territory. Ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity. Needless to say, few of these excursions pass uneventfully.",1
"Long live the Cartwrights. I lost my father at a very young age. Over the years I have learned many things about him. On behalf of my late father, who is not here to say so himself, we love Bonanza. I can remember this as though it were yesterday. Watching this show over the years somehow makes me closer to my long ago lost father.",1

"What are you going to do next? You're going to Disney World!!!!! "" 10 stars.",1
I read many commits when it was in the theaters and they were all bad.... I knew HE was bad news from the start of the movie.... I think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies. The way Clark talks will get you every time.,1
It is lovely. This movie is wonderful. And the music!,1
"But there is a one big shame. In this, like in other Disney's movies is some kind of magic. This is only type of movies that i still have patience to watch. So, we will watch this movie again "" Once upon dream "" or...? Comment?",1
You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why.,1
"< br / > < br / > Favorite Disney additions : the mice! Also, appreciated the continuity - - Cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film.",1
"Recommended. At the ball she meets the handsome Prince Charming. A true Disney masterpiece! When the clock strikes midnight, she runs home, leaving behind one of her glass slippers.",1
When one day a letter is sent to her house telling all available women to attend royal ball.,1
Which is true magic of Disney. From then on I was a Disney child in a good way.,1
"Enjoy! : - ) To enjoy this, I recommend you watch it with friends ( and immediate family, if you like. I feel they made necessary changes to make this a good Disney film. < br / > < br / > You know story already, Cinderella is a girl working for her horrible stepmother and stepsisters. Immediate family is not good enough.",1
There's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke.,1
asked me to go buy them all. We loved the movie. really hope to see more.,1
"< br / > < br / > Overall, "" Cinderella "" ranks as one of the best Disney fairy - tales and comes recommended to young and all that embodies the Disney philosophy that dreams really can come true. And it really deserves its status. "" Cinderella "" is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics. Their antics intertwine generally with the main fairy - tale plot, and are for the most part wonderful. The mice Jaq and Gus are the main sidekicks, and their own nemesis being the stepmother's cat Lucifer. < br / > < br / > The animation and art direction is lovely.",1
"< br / > < br / > THE PLOT : Cinderella is a nice girl who can't catch a break. Walt Disney & his 9 Old Men put their own 1950 spin on the classic fairy tale of Cinderella, which I guess you could say helps form an unofficial "" fairy tale princess trilogy "" from the classic Disney years.",1
"9 / 10. It is a lovely looking film, with gorgeous animation. My favourite animation scene was the dress scene - I just love those mice. A dream is a Wish and So this is love? I don't think it is overrated, underrated don't you mean? are standouts. The characters are also a delight.",1
"Of course, Cinderella didn't get to go, but her stepsisters did. This film is about a magical fairytale. < br / > < br / > My favorite thing about "" Cinderella "" is the music.",1
"The animal friends tend to grate, especially that idiotic Gus. We never know. Who has never wanted to run away from the drudgeries of daily life and find someone who sees you as no one else ever had? The story is older than the English language and somehow it still rings true. I would have cheered had he met his fate in Lucifer's jaws. Cinderella herself was no pushover - making some justly catty remarks at times. Out of all the Princess stories Disney has put out there, Cinderella probably has the most enduring appeal. Ilene woods has a lovely, rich voice, probably my favorite of any Disney heroine. However, she just lacked drive to make her entirely sympathetic. She never works for her dreams that she sings so fondly of.",1
"she has hope that one day she'll find her prince. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, We got to witness Cinderella in animation.",1
But it sure is true classic. The mice are funny and sweet too.,1
"Cinderella herself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters Disney ever created. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairytale. I consider the film to have been the greatest of his films at the time of its release.",1
I can watch it over and over again. The acting was great ; loved the mice!! The music really fit the movie perfectly.,1
This movie was so great!,1
"I love his voice. Gus might not be that smart, but he's humorous. This was an important movie because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. The Grand Duke is a very cool chap and funny too. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Really has that mouse - like quality. < br / > < br / > It's not among Disney's top works, but is satisfying. If this was a failure, there wouldn't be any more Disney animated classics.",1
"< br / > < br / > But of course, the original "" Cinderella "" still maintains its magic, and the story is still good one, though we've all seen it countless times. It's a shame they had to cheapen it with all the marketing for what looks to be a lame follow - up. Thank you, Disney, for doing us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie. We watched this on "" The Wonderful World of Disney "" on ABC last night, and I came to the conclusion that things must be tighter there at "" the Mouse "" than usual.",1
"The villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile. Oh and of course, Cinderella is wonderful as the main character in the movie. In this film it's even more the magical when her rainbow comes smiling. The magic remains. Of course in the real world some are believers others are hoper's.",1
"It is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of Cinderella and her friends, moving the viewers to care for them. The film's suspense, however, is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness, especially in musical numbers. It is this menace that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the viewers'interest. Disney's artists provide the film with an appealing storybook look that emanates delectable fairy tale atmosphere. Overall, Walt Disney's CINDERELLA is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century.",1
"< br / > < br / > Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney. I wanted "" Dumbo, "" but my sisters won out, and we got "" Cinderella. "" I like to showcase Disney to them as much as I can, and we recently watched "" Cinderella "" together. < br / > < br / > A lot has changed since then. I can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe - inspiring Cinderella Castle.",1
"Cinderella takes me back, when I was a little girl I loved the princesses of Disney. Cinderella was one of my favorites because I always was so enchanted by the story. She cleans and cooks for them without ever receiving thanks. When the prince sees Cinderella at the ball, he has fallen hard for her. You'll just have to find out. You can't help but fall in love with this masterpiece.",1
"I wonder how he put up with the animal. ) ( Although he, of course, is richer. ) The animation varies a bit. It's really the animals that make the movie. Moreover he made things hard for himself by picking "" Cinderella "". < br / > < br / > It DOES look good.",1
"Of the three films, "" Cinderella "" is the one most faithful to its origins. Cinderella "" did not follow the same path. They remain among the most popular animated films of all time. The first was his groundbreaking classic "" Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs "" released in 1937. And indeed he had.",1
May be a lot of fun... And if you like to know Bs. I recommended it for a pleasant time of entertaining. AS there where few scenes of downtown and city center.,1
This two songs that have the same melody... but people don't usually realize that... it's just grate!,1
Dale Midkiff has the ways to pull off this character.,1
"What more could you possibly request? Her face can never be seen, but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim. Sister Evelyn would be the obvious culprit, but she moved to the States recently... Or has she? It's a fabulous giallo ( released in the golden year 1972 ) that belongs in the top - five of every fan of Italian cinema. Some classy and tasteful nudity, perhaps? That latter one is truly one of the greatest ( = most gruesome ) acts of violence I've ever seen!",1
"Should this be an American movie I'd rate it 7 : we've seen this before. That's when the real action begins. I think his role should need some upgrading, just to let him show us how great he can be!",1
"Peretti and Luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, though Peretti isn't as classically handsome as Hill. All in all, a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither panders to lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence. Diaz has been suspended from duty, but he's the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated.",1
"I sit through movies like "" Tiempo de valientes "" and I want to talk about cinema for hours. There are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film, but these two actors are the ones the film can't do without. Trapero's film was a journey into a man's mind and experiences, not into the places he saw. < br / > < br / > The second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of detective.",1
And I have to congrats Szifron for all talent he has.,1
"This movie is Damian Szifrón's second immersion in movies after his excellent character study in "" El Fondo del Mar "". It seems the script suits perfectly to the actors and vice versa. < br / > < br / > But I want you to see the movie mainly because I've never dealt with such endearing characters, all of them. I really believe with a film making like this Argentina is really up to Competition.",1
The work of the Director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark.,1
"Weird characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and heroism. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife.",1
"Unfortunately, I doubt anyone outside of Canada will find easily accessible.",1
< br / > < br / > Also Paul is not dead. I love Paul McCartney. < br / > < br / > I do have one complaint.,1
"Sometimes the good guys do win, and they win by honest efforts. It had no violence, no lewdness, and did not deserve a PG rating.",1
A splendid time is guaranteed for all. ). This is a great film for McCartney's and Beatles fans!,1
"This is closest you will get to a Beatles concert today. If you want note perfect music, buy a studio recorded CD. I have a huge 5.",1
"Thanks to this video I was able to enjoy it. I was very happy that he's found love again in Heather. < br / > < br / > I was glued to the set this entire show. And let's hope another lunatic won't change this, because the McCartney catalog is pretty good.",1
Then we shift to Southeast Asia. And the Japs are shooting like mad. Did the Navy have LTAs there? Only then does the second film start.,1
"Otherwise this movie gets good grades for technical accuracy, and gives a rare look into the Navy's LTA operations. Just a fun film to watch.",1
"The Navy LTA ( Lighter Than Air ) shots are authentic, photographed at Tustin and Lakehurst, and the P - 38 squadron is out of March AFB. 'Wally Beery, a little bleary - eyed, boasts to an always incredulous Jimmy Gleason his memories an improvement over reality, and give Beery a Ulysses - like shadow to play against. The following year Jan opened on Broadway in'Carousel.",1
Proud member of Naval Airship Association etc.,1
"A great way to separate himself The Fonz character he played on Happy Days at time. ). If you get a chance, watch it. I saw this on VHS in a'for sale'bin and bought it.",1
"I saw the film twice in the space of one week, both times the at a cinema in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was packed both times and people had to be turned away. Also look out for a very well known actor whose trademark wrestling move is a head - but!",1
There is no Justice in the world. People usually attack what they don't understand. It's a perfect date movie.,1
"I still think this is very funny. Eddie Murphy really made me laugh my ass off on this HBO stand up comedy show. I laughed so hard, I almost fell off my chair.",1
This came out in 1983. Delirious and Raw.,1
!,1
...,1
"And I think you know that. EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is easily the funniest stand - up concert film I have ever seen. Most stand - up acts usually have lulls at some point, but not this one folks. Believe me your fans will love you for it. For 90 min there is not one moment that is not side - splittingly funny.",1
SECOND - The story isn't very good. ! It's not that hard to film in a car!! There are a lot of things wrong with it.,1
To date I have seen it a further 17 times and i still laugh my ass off each time.,1
If only every movie could be this funny.,1
"), but this is by far his MOST HILARIOUS moment. * * * * * and two thumbs up! This movie is about 1hr. It never loses its edge.",1
If only Eddie Murphy were born 10 years later. From crude humor to a joke for kids! Then we'd all remember it.,1
Delirious is hilarious! !,1
You can see real people behind the unreal lines. The friends enjoyed it too. And the directing is wonderful.,1
"There will be no other comedian like Eddie. The first time I came upon Delirious, I only heard it.",1
If you watch the sequel'Raw'don't be disappointed. It's quite good too but doesn't match'Delirious.,1
LOL!!! delirious was so funny.. i was in tears.,1
"Thanks Eddie, god bless. Just long enough to last 20 years. All the jokes are funny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect.",1
Mooommmm!! You can even tell the crowd gets really into.,1
He is SO funny.,1
"And though he talks fast, you catch every joke.",1
!,1
At the time I saw the show I couldn t remember who Mr T. was but still laughed. I have seriously never laughed so hard of anything my entire life. I have never seen anything like it. Now I know who he is and that just makes it so much more funny.,1
"It is funny as hell. But the results were just awesome. < br / > < br / > "" Hey boy, hey boy. Now come on over here, and f @ * * me up the ass! """,1
John Ritter ineptly follows Dorothy Stratten and immediately falls in love with her. Highly Recommended! This film has some great performances by a supurb cast. * * * * * * * * * stars!,1
"If you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on DVD, it was probably'Delirious'you were looking for. That's the huge difference : Eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful and more. He was all we ever needed.",1
"Overall, I give it an 8 / 10. Go see it.",1
"Rating : 79 / 100. If this films comes your way, make sure you see it!!",1
There are still some VHS copies available on internet as well.,1
"< br / > < br / > Judy Davis'performance is stunning, I cannot say enough good things about it. There's too much good in "" High Tide "" to cover in one review. Davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to Cate Blanchett - in both manner and sensibility. ).",1
"In that film, Davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world, despite the suffocation she felt from her community and upbringing. There are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence.",1
! It portrays incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals.,1
Boy was i mistaken.,1
Sort it out boys! All in all an excellent film if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. I was surprised with the amount that I was absorbed in this film.,1
"America, either lock these guys up or put them in charge. Much of the film is Trey and Matt running amok with their new toy box.",1
BASEketball is a great comedy gives everyone what they want. 8 out of 10.,1
Oscar material. 10 out of 10.,1
!,1
Don't you? Fine.,1
a definite must see for all comedy fans. BASEketball becomes a nationwide sport.,1
And sublimity is the stuff this film is made of.,1
< br / > < br / > P. Does anybody think its weird for me to like them both?,1
Recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor. The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly.,1
Totally insane.,1
I loved this film and it only cost me £2.,1
"Sounds simple. In fact, I might try it one day. After game hits the streets, it soon becomes a huge success. This sport is known as baseketball.",1
"! Watch the movie!! I'm serious. This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then pee. Best movie.",1
BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.,1
"It's GREAT. < br / > < br / > Overall, a crude, but extremely funny, movie. Very underrated.",1
"This movie is just funny. I still find the bit at the start funny when he says "" want a beer........ cock "".",1
"Mainly they're just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Watch it dude, it'hilarious. It's obvious that I love this movie. His agent leans over : "" Minnesota. "" After shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year.",1
This is mainly what makes South Park soooo funny. I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. That is apparent in BASEketball.,1
5 out of 10.,1
"By the way, stay through the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. "", "" Top Secret! "", and "" Naked Gun, "" the humor flies out almost every second. Like his previous efforts which include "" Airplane! There are so many moments that work, it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat.",1
"Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films. And it succeeded admirably in doing so. Altogether, an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's great works.",1
"I love this old movie! She does EVERYTHING with flair! Understandably, the visuals are not great. It's dated.",1
Bette Midler's version is much more interesting.,1
Roger Ebert gave is 3 1 / 2 stars! WONDERFUL! And it deserved 4!,1
You almost wish people like this really existed. New York has never looked so good! And neither has anyone in this movie.,1
"Stella ends up pregnant. They like each other. You get the drift. Stella is a story from depression era America. On her wall, pictures of movie stars she idolizes. Stella tells the guy news. In the morning, she doesn't really want to get out of bed. His response? """,1
< br / > < br > It is very good.,1
"< br / > < br / > If you like horror films shot in England, give it a go.",1
"The narrative is pure Golden Age. He is duly murdered in a In English - speaking world, there have really only been two. There have been successes, for example the radical reworkings of Ellery Queen and others by Claude Chabrol. A repulsive character is introduced who gives a number of potential suspects reason to kill him. < br / > < br / > Before that came Michael Curtiz's brilliant'The Kennel Murder Case '. < br / > < br / > The problem with most films from Golden Age books is that they try to be period recreations of the Merchant Ivory / Jane Austen school, and end up looking silly.",1
"The personages are similar to Agatha Christie stories, all they are various suspects. Who's the killer?. The tale is remade as ¨Calling Philo Vance¨ ( 1940 ).",1
"We're so lucky to have his films available on DVD on TCM today. """,1
"Always remember, the least likely actor could very well be the killer. Eugene Palette, ( Detective Sgt. Enjoy a great Classic from the past.",1
"I can picture DeForrest Kelley watching film and saying to himself -'I'll have to use that sometime '. There were times when this movie seemed to get a whole lot more complicated than it needed to be, but I guess that's part of it's charm. The dropping of the dagger into the Chinese vase was the kicker for me ; I mean, couldn't somebody have just dropped it? Seems logical, but then there's always the case that doesn't fit the rules.",1
"In every way, a classic. There's no soundtrack music to cue us. The cast is terrific.",1
"There are some films that every Horror fan owes himself ( or herself ) to see, and Emilio Miraglia's "" La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte "" aka. "" The Red Queen Kills Seven Times "" ( 1972 ) is definitely one of them. < br / > < br / > The film starts out incredibly in a beautiful Gothic castle in Germany.",1
"It's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. Bromwell High is nothing short of brilliant.",1
"Eugene Palette is better than usual playing very straight as an admiring police partner to Vance, with his very professional timing. Jack Okey did the good art direction. Fortunately they assigned suave William Powell first to the character. This film has a despicable villain who gets murdered, and a claustrophobically challenging locale inside an apartment complex.",1
Recommend to everyone.,1
"William Powell is terrific as Philo Vance, gentleman detective. It's pure entertainment!",1
Mary Astor isn't given much to do but she adds class and beauty to production. < br / > < br / > Well worth seeing.,1
"But because it happens so fast and is... slightly dubious morally it doesn't lessen my opinion of KMC's status as a classic! < br / > < br / > The army of cops at the crime scene didn't really do a very good job in finding the second dead body and unconscious dog did they! I never understood why the DA had to trail Vance around everywhere, I always thought they were deskbound.",1
This one is definitely a keeper.,1
"His intelligence, style and effortless sophistication have made him one of the most contemporary - seeming of actors from past. And why was Coe's brother, Brisbane Coe, found dead in the main - floor closet? Then there's the dagger wound in his back. But wait. He's also good company. Few things escape Vance. Coe was no suicide ; this was murder. < br / > < br / > We're sympathetic.",1
"The murders are projects, barely human beings. Nothing more.",1

""", recently remaindered in UK bookstores. Miss Hepburn in particular benefits from this love. Mr Gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. Make no mistake this is her picture.",1
"Powell has a lovely group of suspects, as extensive as what normally is in a Thin Man mystery. This is why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studios putting them out. It's all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and why. It doesn't hold a candle to this one.",1
William Powell is as affable a Philo Vance as you will find.,1
Enjoy.,1
Highly recommended you try! Also Eugene Palette's Detective Sgt. Watch and see if you can wrap your head around this one's mystery. Doesn't stop movie from being just plain good fun viewing though.,1
He is a joy to watch. Bravo!,1
"Already middle - aged, he was stuck in somewhat of a career rut by the time this one came along. Mary Astor is very lovely here. It gives the movie a baroque quality. In - between these films he developed into a somewhat offbeat romantic lead, at times even essaying gentleman gangster roles.",1
Otherwise : Have fun!,1
Truly a minus.,1
and of course no classic is complete without Audrey Hepburn.,1
"One of Dr. It hurts by being a television product, albeit even one more slightly expensive than usual. 'The Karate Killers'was chosen to open the season. True's daughters - Sandy ( Kim Darby ) - accompanies the U. N. C. L. E. boys on their global quest. I was a fan for life from that moment on.",1
"Bacall fits that part here. but it's worth watching for Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. But listen to dialogue!",1
"Great Classic 1945 film without Humphrey Bogart. The real bad guy this film is Victor Francen, ( Licata ) "" Beast with Five Fingers "" who gives an outstanding performance.",1
"Despite these absurdities, the performances are all very good - especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. The big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents. This enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast, and many memorable scenes. It seems pretty weird that the Brothers Warner couldn't find any Spanish speaking actors in Los Angeles!",1
< br / > < br / > Bacall is just gorgeous. Not great chemistry - and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. Bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film. But I still really liked this picture. Mood is used to great affect - I especially liked the fog scene. I must say I found the murder of little girl quite bold for this period film. There is great tension and it moves along well enough. < br / > < br / > Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as supporting cast. No accent whatsoever. I think there was some miscasting in having her portray a British upper - crust lady.,1
"< br / > < br / > Paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful. Conclusion : Bacall is somewhat miscast. Uh, no. The two have no chemistry. < br / > < br / > Definitely worth seeing even with its flaws. Seymour wasn't a small actor. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall.",1
"Graham Greene has been translated into film many times of course, in such masterpieces as "" Thin Man "" and in lesser vehicles. "" What good is love in the face of death? What is a thief? I know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull, and I can understand that. The lack of glitz, of "" bubble, "" of narrative "" bounce "" help to make this movie very worthwhile. The most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from Greene's complex and guilt - ridden psychology, which pervades the film. Yet I found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is claustrophobic world.",1
"The local diplomat, Licata ( Victor Francken ) is already a willing associate of the Falangists. She's an aristocrat - the daughter of a Press lord. He has been sent to England to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed. It could have been a better film.",1
: - ) I'm sure I've met Arthur my travels somewhere.,1
Not without reservations. She does her best. The character wants to be helpful. But the story and acting can scarcely be bettered.,1
In a 40s thriller!,1
MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great manGeneral Douglas MacArthur. In war there is no substitute for victory.,1
Name just says it all.,1
"< br / > < br / > It was in 1950 / 51 in the Korean War that Gen. MacArthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat. Feeling that he'll be deserting his men at their greatest hour of need MacArthur reluctantly, together with his wife and young son, did what he was told only to have it haunt him for the reminder of the war. Told by his The General did that suffering far less US Military losses then any other allied commander in the War in the Pacific! The movie "" MacArthur "" begins and ends at Gen. Douglas MacArthur's, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata the US Military Academy of West Point on the Hudson. That he'll return and return with the might of the US Army & Navy to back up his pledge!",1
"< br / > < br / > Oddly enough, the potential was there. Yet for all of this, "" MacArthur "" is perfectly adequateand not much more than that. Not that Universal's "" MacArthur "" is bad. It's just not all it should have been.",1
Note how he deals with MacArthur That must have been a subject they avoided. The film opens with MacArthur addressing the student body in 1962.,1
"I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS.",1
"with possible exception of Ed Flanders. I very much enjoyed this movie, although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about MacArthur's early life. Well worth watching.",1
"Peck's MacArthur is of a more reflective, thoughtful bent, comparable to the liberal intellectuals he played in some of his other films. Scott, of course, portrayed Patton as aggressive and fiery - tempered, a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race, not just with the enemy. I think that this criticism is a At times, he even seems to be a man of the political left. I suspect that in real life General MacArthur was as volcanic an individual as Patton, but that is not how he appears in this film. It is as if Atticus Finch from ` To Kill a Mockingbird'had put on a general's uniform. Like a previous reviewer, I am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other. < br / > < br / > The main difference, however, lies in the way the two leaders are played. Gregory Peck dominates this film even more than George C. Scott dominated ` Patton '.",1
"The rest all is typical Bollywood screen writing. His was all important role of the master while Amitabh was his loyal servant. This movie will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a one man industry. But this is a caper, remember? Zanzeer saw the making of Angry Young Man. This movie had a good dose of them. Thanks to Manmohan Desai.",1

One of the campers, James, finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts, and feels impelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it on. < br / > < br / > All trashing aside, I actually enjoyed this film. All good movies "" inspire "" some direct to video copycat flick. The weapons, although apparently real, look really plastic - y. Then I spotted Full Moon's latest offering, Demonicus.",1
what is our world coming to?,1
The normal stuff! So every cave is complete with a Caultron Pot? The music even sounds like video games. The acting is really terrible.,1
I watched it some years ago. This may not be casualty. < br / > < br / > I think that the title is a hope about life!,1
Remarkable debut for first - time writer / director Henry Bromell. Macy and Sutherland are the stand - outs here.,1
Macy is excellent as always.,1
< br / > < br / > Pretty good acting performances by the cast. Macy is excellent as the depressed Alex.,1
"The film is directed astutely and consists of a wonderfully put together cast as well as a swift, family - conscious screenplay ( also by Brommell ) that brings life to an otherwise fatigued genre.",1
"Suspend belief and enjoy, this is truly time well spent.",1
One day Alex doesn't know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows.,1
Brilliant work all round. < br / > < br / > Pete Scary stuff!,1

His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next assignment, he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist.",1
"The title, "" Panic, "" initially seems paradoxical, given the lack of overt emotion. Thematically, this union is less coincidence, more the work of fate. < br / > < br / > More than once I was reminded of his performance in "" Fargo, "" another strongly character - driven movie. This performance, however, may be an eye - opener for many. < br / > < br / > William H. Macy, as Alex, is as convincing as always. At one point Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry.",1
"When are the powers that be in Hollywood going to wake up? This movie displays the kind of ensemble work one wishes for in every film. And finally, there's Sammy ( David Dorfman ). < br / > < br / > More of us would go to theatres if we were treated to quality fare like this. Macy, Campbell, Ullman, and Ritter are also terrific.",1
"I saw this movie a few months ago on cable, and it was fantastic.",1
The basic dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded. The cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background.,1
Very fine acting by all.,1

"What a surprising treat to come across on late television. dark, but not obnoxiously so. But the film works.",1

"And he's going to have to do it very soon. Parks'waiting room he meets a young woman, Sarah Cassidy ( Neve Campbell ), whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember.",1
"Just as we all do, at times. Go get it.",1
The impact stays with you right after you leave theater.,1
"Macy is the dutiful son, Sutherland is the domineering father. Son wants out of the business, father won't let him. This is the kind of movie Hollywood needs to make more of. Just people dealing with being people.",1
"He shows a maturity beyond his years. Neve Campbell surprised in her pivotal role of Sarah. He has to see someone to help him find peace with himself. Parks, the man who unravels the mystery. David Dorfman, is a delight in film.",1
Macy is such a great actor. I highly applaud the casting of Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife. Who knew?,1
"< br / > < br / > William H. Macy stars as Alex, a hitman who works for his father's ( Sutherland ) contract - killing business. When he meets a young woman ( Campbell ) he feels invigored and decides it's time to quit the family business. Brommel's script feels like a Shakespearean tragedy, with a definite theme of destiny running throughout. In his middle - age, he becomes increasingly disgusted with what he has done all his life.",1

This deserves a 12 out of 10. The scenery is amazing and wardrobes are exquisite.,1
"First of all, the characters. Great! < br / > < br / > Then, the cast. It seemed too ordinary, actually. Oh man, why? "" It would really be a good show to follow!",1

"That has been the most disappointing aspect. It caught be my surprise, as it was a break from listening to anything Chinese. I got hooked on this as apparently ABC has licensed this show to Pearl TV in Hong Kong.",1
"Everything here no one really needed to know. Overall, though, it was an interesting look into the lives of Lucy and Desi. Oh well. That wasn't too great. Yeah, would have gotten more in, been able to explore some more emotion. That is definitely so not true and very, very sad. What was explored was done well, for the most part.",1
This show is well worth it!!! ! I want that last show! html WE CAN DO IT!! PetitionOnline. The casting was spectacular!,1
It has the best cast of talent I have seen in a very long time. ). I don't think this show was given enough time to gain an audience. We want to watch what we can! PetitionOnline. This show is totally worth watching.,1
Thanks for reading. Wonderful show. So sad that it's gone.,1
I am SO sorry to see go! The writing was pretty good also. Will the series go on video? Thank God for that.,1

This show was Fabulous.,1
I loved the entire cast too. it sucks.,1
Too bad it didn't last.,1
I highly reccommend.,1
Is it a plot to steal an inheritance? Is it Franziska ( Marina Malfatti )?,1
"The action, the stakes, the plot. Matt Damon will forever be Jason Bourne.",1
"Can Bourne finally find the answers he has been looking for or will his old employers silence him for good? Performances throughout are nearly faultless - even Julia Styles begins to offer something more than book - wormy eye - candy. Not to say it lost it altogether but compared to the fantastic "" Bourne Identity "", it seemed more like a slow - burning spy novel rather than an action - thriller.",1
"But that doesn't slow it down. I saw the The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend, and, wow!",1
"< br / > < br / > Bourne remains street tough, and elusive. Its all about the action. I doubt that. """,1
They never treat the audience like idiots. I was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did. This movie was excellent.,1
The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics ( Ultimatum has an 85 / 100 on metacritic. Jason Bourne is played very well by MattDamon. Ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.,1
< br / > < br / > 8 / 10. < br / > < br / > But all in all TBU is an enjoyable film and worth a watch. The near - misses between the CIA and Bourne kept you on your toes and throughly entertained. < br / > < br / > And secondly ( inevitably ) - the SHAKY CAMERA. He crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something! This sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull. Very unrealistic.,1
"This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization. He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. In reality, perhaps they are. These sequences add realism to the film in feeling.",1
It is a political film more than a plain entertainment. A woman and the Senate ; read my lips. So go and watch film.,1
"Most of the actors were from Austrailia and New Zeland, and the repressed accents are detectable at times. Madeline Zima was decent, if not overly memorable, as the teen - aged Lucy.",1
"But if you watch the movie, than you'll notice it! How they got around that?",1
"But all that doesn't really matter, for "" The Bourne Ultimatum "" is an action movie. Yeah, Jason Bourne is back, and this time, he's here with a vengeance. And the action scenes are rather impressive. Jason Bourne is a Captain - America project - like, who's gone completely wrong.",1
Obviously there are only two originals left. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. It's enjoyable following leads along with Bourne. Unless Do some framing. This movie felt choppy at times. It basically makes the movie a half - prequel. I wasn't disappointed. Them teaming up was kind of odd to me.,1
"< br / > < br / > The acting is good, and evolution of Julia Stiles'character "" Nicky "" put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light. < br / > < br / > Hoo boy, does Ultimatum have suspense! The music also helped generate much suspense, and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail - bite over.",1
"This movie is awesome. From beginning to end, it is filled with genuine thrills. He is this role.",1
"First and foremost, speaking as no fan of the genre, "" The Bourne Ultimatum "" is a breathtaking, virtuoso, superb action movie. < br / > < br / > Secondly, it is a silly malarky of cartoonish super - hero stuff. < br / > < br / > Joan Allen plays what appears to be the Good Cop against Strathairn's Bad One. And, there is Julia Stiles as the No reference is made to Abu Ghraib or the Executive Branch's outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights, none is necessary.",1
And the veteran cast chasing Bourne is superb with a nice part by Albert Finney. They aren't his target. The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off. Or does it? It goes further to play the anti - Bond theme. Bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past.,1
"Please, oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. Right.. moving on. I will begin by saying I am very pleased with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. The fights between Bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch. As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is... it seems as though he was just meant to play Jason Bourne. This allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. It sticks to what works and adds a little more.",1
"Since I usually shy away from action and thriller type movies, this was such great news to me. I look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future. Well done. < br / > < br / > Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne.",1
"It makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but I'll be damned if it isn't a blast to watch them get there. The Bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper - reality that is full of technological - based magic.",1
"I thought Rachel York was fantastic as "" Lucy. "" Lucy didn't fit mold of the old studio system. This approach, I thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. My response to that is, "" So what? "" I couldn't believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally. She is a chameleon who can play ( and sing ) anything!",1
Come on it was not that bad at all. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this installment.,1
"However, it appears he was born to play Bourne ( pardon the pun ). Identity I found the superior of the two, but Supremacy isn't far behind. So I went out and bought both the original movies. You really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything. And boy did Bourne Ultimatum not disappoint! Because of this I was first in line today to see the Bourne Ultimatum.",1
"The stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it. With that said, the Bourne series has been fantastic. It has been the CIA who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them. < br / > < br / > Once again, Bourne is brought into the minds of CIA by false pretenses.",1
< br / > < br / > It's just so intense. The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it.,1
"I love Bourne trilogy. This time, it ends.",1
"I don't hand out ten star ratings easily. I think it adds to the suspense. A movie really has to impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Paul Greengrass has done it again. However for me, that last one was never a problem.",1
I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS. I loved this movie.,1
"At the end Frank Gorshin makes an appearance. Thanks to Julie Newmar to re - living a villain role, also. ! He didn't lose his touch! Adam and Burt rekindle the same on - screen chemistry that never seems to have left!",1
"I note that clips from "" Batman "" were from the movie, and not series itself, probably because of legal restrictions. Let's hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on DVD.",1
"Martin, the diamond commender's son, swears vengeance. Xica da Silva "" is definitely a must. etc. I wish I could buy the whole series on DVD. The slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village.",1
To see Adam and Burt was a delight and this TV movie is simply fantastic in every aspect. Very well done! My advice to all Batman fans is : SEE IT!! I'm gonna watch it again. All kids need some kind of hero. ! I had an urge to see the caped crusader. They play themselves as they played their parts in the series.,1
I really enjoyed this. < br / > < br / > Q,1
"They were being campy and not taking themselves, or this movie too seriously. I'm glad I did. Adam West and Burt Ward reunite as themselves. This is told in flashback. But, in a way, they were acting as their "" Batman and Robin "" selves.",1
I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS. I loved this movie.,1
I'm making a copy for my kids right now.,1
"This eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the Batmobile and why. The casting ( as in "" Surviving "" ) is excellent. Brett Rickaby ( "" Frank Gorshin It was very well done. It was funny, well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show.",1
"It was also great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. And the same applies to this "" reunion "" and "" flashback "" movie.",1
"It is He called Jerry, his butler, ` Alfred '. New characters are introduced who don't fit the mix. These have mixed results. There are many kinds of reunion shows.",1
We need it released again to Telemundo. This soap opera was best soap opera EVER.,1
They're all alright. < br / > < br / > All right... ignoring Season 8. What country is he from?,1
). The humor is usually very mature too. She looks good without make up too.,1
"This classic is on television as much as "" Full House "".",1
The only good part of the final season was the finale.,1
"Bob also annoys Red to his full extent. They also play a major role in the show's story. Kitty is just the opposite. The First Season is original, funny, and enjoyable. That 70s Show is the best TV show ever, period. < br / > < br / > Well, the First Season is great. It is a basic continuation of the First.",1
"Now only is this show one of best ever created, it is clever and funny. If TV was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record!",1
A perfect show.,1
"Topher Grace is also a great actor. I still watch it, and it does make me laugh. I love this show. Randy is horrible. = ] Period. Unlike a lot of fans, I did not completely hate the 8th season.",1
The following seasons the character where fledged out. I enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different. Not this one though.,1
Xica has become my Heroine. Even down to homosexuality.,1
"Donna, a forward - thinking feminist, is the object of Eric's affection and these 2 have the core relationship of the show. The humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable. I haven't liked many TV shows post 1990, but THAT 70S SHOW is great.",1
I like it. Hmm what i forget? He wants to get laid badly. It was dam Funny! The group Pervert. His one big pussy. And there's FeZ. His from India. He is a town playboy.,1
"This show was absolutely great, and I always look forward to watching it.",1
"< br / > < br / > Its all round classic I mean the cast, the writers, the director, its just a recipe for success. For example the way Hydes character always wants to see his friends get in some sort of trouble the more it happens the funnier it becomes.",1
Dumbass! < br / > < br / > great show.,1
Please come back... It was the greatest show ever!!! They should make new episodes.,1
"Like the characters in this show, I too was a teen during the 70s. No other show does camera tricks like this. < br / > < br / > Overall this is a very funny sitcom.",1
"That'70s Show "" is definitely the funniest show currently on TV. "", that always makes me laugh.",1
That 70's Show is a great example. Ashton is already the John Travolta of our time.,1
... and the series lets you forget all that. Then there are the parents. They represent what happened when the 60's finally reached the suburbs during the 1970's. I am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series.,1
I absolutely LOVED this Soap. Will highly recommend : )...,1
( Sorry for my poor English again. ) I don't know how you can like this show. That's the only difference that it has with other TV comedies. I would give 4 out of 10. Its humor is pathetic!,1
"That 70s Show was hilarious, smart and so real. I actually didn't start watching the show until it came on FX. Finally a show for everyone to enjoy.",1
"The idea of having "" That 70's Show "" without Eric or to a lesser extent Kelso is ridiculous. It just didn't really connect, it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn't even funny. They also brought in the standard cousin Oliver, only this time it just wasn't a kid. I'm guessing this was character development, but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from "" Family Matters "". I think more than half of the last season was Donna pretending to be amused.",1
"< br / > < br / > Meanwhile Red goes out and meets Donna's weirdo parents, Bob and Midge.",1
! I have all 8 seasons of that 70's show!!,1
The actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point. Season 8 was the real problem kicked in. Without Topher grace or Ashton Kutcher the show simply fell apart. Its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs. This was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television.,1
They stuck with the show and it was a success. This show has come so far. You are the best! JUST CLOSE OUT THE SERIES BIG TIME GUYS!,1
"It's not that she doesn't like Ken, it's just that she's used to a whole'nother way of life. She says, "" I can't tell him the way I feel in English, and Ken can't tell me the way he feels in Japanese. "" Not only that, she is homesick and wants to return to Japan. It's a rather sad love story with a killer 80s techno - nintendo soundtrack. The marriage is only expected to be temporary, that is, until Kyoto gains legal status again.",1
This is a cute and sad little story of cultural difference.,1
"There was something honest about it. The word "" Indy "", is thrown around as if's a Genre.. Ha!..",1
xica da Silva is one of the best Brazilians opera soap ever!,1
"Adam Jones may not be a well known name yet, but he will be.",1
< br / > < br / > A very promising first film. Cross - eyed is a very original and funny movie.,1
"More, please. Debut? These days, its rare to see a movie that is well - written, well - directed, well - edited and well - acted.",1
This guy can make people laugh and think ; that'special. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next. Very funny stuff. Cross Eyed is a rare gem.,1
Anyway liked it. Dreams are what you make of them. Just keep going and be who you are.,1
Definitely worth seeing! Even the peripheral roles are well written and well acted. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart ; it's touching story with fast paced comedy woven throughout.,1
There is something to like for everyone. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot. If you've had a terrible roommate.,1
You can't help but smile and laugh at antics that take place in this movie. Bravo! I can't wait for his sophomore effort.,1
Without that a comedy is just a bunch of ideas. Who cares. < br / > < br / > The dining room scenes are an absolute HOOT. They sneak up on you. < br / > < br / > Put on your seat belt. I love this film?,1
I wish Telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning. It is a very entertaining novela which is set in Brazil. Overall Xica merits a 10 out of 10!,1
"< br / > < br / > The standouts where the actors. I also really liked the vigilante duo. Well done to Adam Jones crew. Ridiculous and funny. Some of the other acting was good, some was so - so, but none of it was bad.",1
The audience loved this movie. Definite a must see.,1
"Worth a look for those seeking something different. Nico Fidenco's funky, throbbing score hits groovy spot. George regains his health and goes back to work.",1
"Emy will remain a virgin until she is married, to a man she has never met. It is simply how it is done in her world. The beautiful doctor seems OK with this arranged marriage. Neither one counts on third party, one Ilona Staller, who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games. It actually has a story, and it is very romantic indeed. Classic drama. Emy decides to do away with custom, and she gives herself to her Western man.",1
"Recommended for fans of original'Emmanuelle ', of which I am one!",1
maybe a fifties version of when harry met sally?,1
Turns out to be very nice.,1
"Vera - Ellen is that dancer and - wow, what legs! The print I saw was actually pretty good considering its age and the fact that it's in public domain. A few years ago, I bought several $ 1 DVD's that contained two movies each. Romero can be a bit frantic here but Niven becomes hilariously bemused throughout.",1
"And of course there's also... VERA - ELLEN'S LEGS. Oh hell. I can only imagine how it looked on the big screen back in'51. The plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven. Not sappy, not contrived, not melodramatic. But it's really so much more.",1
"So who delivered the laughs for me? Good Stuff! I could go on and on, but rest assured I really enjoyed this movie.",1
A triumph. This is without a doubt the greatest film ever made.,1
Appereantly it's a'Cinderella story'but I most certainly didn't thought of it that way while watching the movie. It's like watching a movie and getting a Laurel & Hardy short with it for free.,1
"Laurel and Hardy provide several enjoyable interludes, including their well - known skit involving a tiny harmonica, and we watch fine turns by such as Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long.",1
"Recommended for anyone and everyone! Yes, this gets the full ten stars.",1
"If you are in the mood for making fun of someone this is definitely the film to watch. Oh, my. When it was over, I had to rewind the film to once again watch the real Gary and all his shining idiocy. Although Olivia was the focus, I would have liked to have seen one of the "" fictitious "" shorts take a jab at Gary's Barry Manilow impersonation whic h was equally ridiculous.",1
"Immensely moving, and as profound as camp ever gets.",1
"This movie HAS to be seen to be believed! THE BEAVER TRILOGY is, without a doubt, one of the most brilliant films ever made. He's an incredibly nice guy to boot.",1
This movie is amazing for several reasons. He struggles to gain acceptance within his own community to no avail.,1
"It is its own genre. If you are a movie fan in general, you must see this. But I really wish someone would put this onto a DVD. If you are a Sean Penn fan, you must see this. If you are a Crispin Glover fan, you must see this.",1
"I loved it. < br / > < br / > A film not to miss. < br / > < br / > Another one of those fact is stranger than fiction pieces of film. "" I have not seen anything else like it. < br / > < br / > Jacob.",1
"< br / > < br / > Also ( again... But in the TV series, they've supposedly only been in jail for 18 months. I know, I have a lot to say ), in the movie, the guys snort coke instead of smoking hash. But some actors portray totally different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays "" Patrick Lewis "" in the movie, but in the series he plays Randy. They just... conflict with each other. Then at the end, it shows Ricky and Julian saying that they've been in jail for 2 years.",1
"One year later, the red lady left her grave. A fight ensues. They are sisters. There are many twists and surprises in the film.",1
You will be glad you did. Brilliant. TV how TV should be. This is a great Canadian comedy series.,1

Why they think it's sooooo bad etc.,1
I give Soldier * * * 1 / 2 out of * * * * *,1
I think this is Kurt Russell'best movie.,1
"The story is basic, and the plot is very good.",1
I really liked this movie.,1
A planet gets totalled. Kurt doesn't talk much.,1
I have to say I quite enjoyed Soldier.,1
"You'll note I specified the genre. However, i'll try.",1
"Who knew such things in a generally peaceful country ( i. e. usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars ) could be so heated - up politically? At least, that's part of Sjoman's aim here.",1
Maybe script writer David Peoples was nostalgic? < br / > < br / > I'll give this one 3 out of 5.,1
The costumes are like something from a mad max movie. !,1
"There is action in it, but that's not really what it's about. If you focus on that, you'll end up with ( as others have noted ) a bad "" Aliens "" clone. But, again, that's not what it's about. And he really does a wonderful job - - it can take two viewings to appreciate it.",1
"Todd ) only has 72 lines, and something like 104 words. What a challenge! What a perfect example of "" Less Is More... "" Kurt Russell ( Sgt. Also "" Gladiator "" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was in Soldier also.",1
angelfire.,1
3 or so stars. This was excellent.,1
"Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self - reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of Todd ; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions. Better still, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might.",1
in the storyline. This film could convert anyone who avoids A / A as mindless violence.,1
"Always. Todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a loner. Fear and Discipline we are told. Discipline to hold him in check through his fear, to overcome it and perform tactically. I'm going to start here too, with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting I've seen Russell pull off.",1
As a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like Todd. This is a great movie. Jason Scott Lee being one of them. For a while he lives there but can't adjust to normal life. This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action / sci - fi fans. Russell obviously comes out on top. < br / > < br / > The story is very well done and there are no holes.,1
). The film that Vilgot is making. < br / > < br / > 2.,1
I have not seen Soldier 2 but this one it one of my favorites.,1
Both sequences are quite gripping in different ways.,1
"Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid, and want to rebuild your faith!",1
"I watched this movie expecting what I got : good sci - fi cowboy stuff. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly, and gorgeous. Yes! Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. His robot becomes human, in spite of the constraints.",1
I recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film. And you know what it worked.,1
< br / > < br / > Always. < br / > < br / > That's why this film did'nt do well. I only saw it when it came onto cable.,1
"Russell's performance here is one of the best he's ever given. It is almost a mime performance. There are flaws. Jason Scott Lee is brutish as a "" superior "" genetic soldier.",1
Not surprisingly so have all of his other movies! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications!,1
"He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes. But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite.",1
). < br / > < br / > If you see this on your TV schedule I would recommend giving it a chance. I don't think you will be disappointed. Sean Pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble Sci - Fi lineage.,1
"Soldier isn't a great movie, and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons. Just don't expect the next Bladerunner. For me, this made the movie worth the time it took to watch. < br / > < br / > Second, I'm a Kurt Russell fan.",1
"I noticed btw that IMDB has got wrong information about Sanna. Her name, as you might have noticed in my review ; ), is NOT Heikkilä, but Hietala.",1

"This movie has it all. Max, the explosives expert. Frank, the master mind. Comedy. < br / > < br / > Truly a great film loaded with laughs and great acting.",1
It was on Star Movies one afternoon. I saw this movie with my dad.,1
check it out if you dare! Remember the early days of Pay Per View?,1
Had never heard of it previously. < br / > < br / > I believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th. The humor is mostly in the dialog. Recommended 110 %. ). A great combination of cast and writing. This movie needs your full attention.,1
"< br / > < br / > Corbin Bernsen has met four cons over the years, and he decides they can all be useful in a bank robbery he is planning in a small Montana town. One of the best ones is DISORGANIZED CRIME. I like this film for several reasons. But he hasn't given any details on the crime to the fellows, nor do they really know each other at all.",1
"All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to see this movie. It gets it's meaning across. The cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie. Everything about this movie seemed to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting.",1
He gets the drop on O'Neill and escapes. A lot of comedy involved is them feeling each other out.,1
This film is a buried treasure. I like to think of it as much more than that. I didn't expect to like this film as much as I did. Give it a try. It didn't look particularly great.,1
'It is hard identify with a woman who keeps a cannon up her pants - - in lue of leggage. More effective than contemporary'drama.,1
"These two characters would not have had much to do with each other. < br / > < br / > This one is strictly a B - Movie ; taken as that, it is rather enjoyable. Harmonica ( Chaeles Bronson ) is obsessed with his own broken family, and obsessed with revenge.",1
"She shows her acting skills much more as Otsu in the NHK drama, "" Musashi. "" Even the opening credits and music have that spaghetti feel : Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. The really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful (! )",1
"This is a movie with a good sense of feeling. Even though it made me cry, I admit, at the end, the whole movie just brightened up my outlook on life thereafter. This movie was perfect! Every scene was put together perfectly. Who knows?",1

"He could take a light script and, with the right casting and editing, put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star. And there's ample support from Ryan O'Neal ( in his best role in years ) and Christopher MacDonald. This is her film, but she doesn't overstep her bounds as a lead. Ardolino's next ( Where are they now? ) You really want to know how things are going to work out.",1
This is film at its best! !,1
But I do know that you need to see this movie. It just gets recycled. Another Downey must - see!,1
!,1
A charming romantic comedy. Suffice to say it's worth seeing.,1
A lovely and charming fantasy that will engulf and enchan you. Shepherd has rarely been seen on screen to better advantage and she and Downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles. He is told he can return to earth but not as himself.,1
"Yellow is energetic, playful, self - aware, explorative. It is this that, for me, really gives Yellow wings. Jag är nyfiken Yellow "" is a lot of fun. She is a complete person complex, flawed, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. "" Don't expect Bergman here. At other times, Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary.",1
"I've watched this film a number times on tv, and each time found it most enjoyable.",1
Very funny and sweet!,1
"The story is an interesting fantasy that doesn't end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly. It was quite obvious that Burke isn't that young. Pepperhaus "" is a somewhat unusual mix of kids'film and horror, with effective use of sounds and music.",1
I hope I can find it at a local video store. It's interesting at very least.,1

"They manage to escape and to kill her father and Anna can finally wake up. While she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house - the paperhouse. And next time she falls asleep the horror begins. One day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to. The doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so. I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. She makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting. Unfortunately I could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night. Especially the scene when Anna's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short. < br / > < br / > Now to the plot. Her dreams became a horrendous nightmare. When she fells a sleep, which often strangely happens just immediately, she finds herself near the house on a big green field.",1
49. Her life is also in danger as these dreams mirror her own state of health.,1
The only thing I can't stand is that it was marketed as a horror film... it really isn't.,1
It is not really a horror flick so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. This is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama.,1
"This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content & style over empty - headed flashing lights & constant loud noises. If it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of'Paper House'is more in the vein of Sophocles than Tobe Hooper. An unenviable task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly know. < br / > < br / > Essentially, if you have a short attention span or lack the wit & imagination to engage with literary narrative you won't like this film. I'm glad that this is available on DVD now.",1
"I've read one comment which labeled this film "" trash "" and "" a waste < br / > < br / > of time. "" The lead couple is < br / > < br / > clumsy, inept, funny and endearing in their first copulation scene. And the last is the end of an angry fight, < br / > < br / > that is believable. < br / > < br / > I just rented the new Criterion DVD's of both Yellow and Blue. I think this person got their political undies tugged a bit < br / > < br / > too much. Especially the supposedly "" pornographic "" sex < br / > < br / > scenes. The first such scene is very realistic.",1
"I've only ever seen this film once before, about ten years ago. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really excellent here. < br / > < br / > Paperhouse is much more than just a horror.",1
"I am really impressed. I loved, as always, Hans Zimmer's score. And what a directorial debut by Bernard Rose! It's a shame that more people have not seen it.",1
"Great story and characters. However, it is worth the rent.",1
It is definitely a keeper.,1
"That should confirm I was desperate! Quote "" he looks like madman "". Long after I had stopped searching I found out about Paperhouse. But none where satisfactory. So Anna decides to draw her father in.",1
"While you may find this puppy in your horror section it's anything but. Is a good word to sum up Bernard Rose's brilliantly haunting and poetic Paperhouse. The acting is of young Charlotte Burke in this, her feature debut, is a truly impressing as well. There's much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into. < br / > < br / > Wow!",1
"Put quite simply, this film is terrifying.",1
"Which, in view of later events, doesn't seem like a far cry from the truth. She even brings her absent father into the drawing, with disastrous results.",1
The DVD is available R2 only. This is a way cool fantasy movie. < br / > < br / > Hans Zimmer's score is also ace.,1
"She becomes very self aware and strong towards the end, even finding she doesn't "" hate boys "" as she so defiantly claimed at first. Both Charlotte Burke and Elliot Spiers do a magnificent job throughout, I find the editorial comment on Amazon. I'm quite proud to be an owner of the soundtrack on CD when it was released in the United States on RCA Victor.",1
I cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece. Be prepared to invest much thought in this deliberately paced film. This touch gives her even more believability out necessity.,1
"That'too bad - - it's really very good. Also, if you hate fantasies stay far away. Despite the fact that this is about a teenage girl and has a PG - 13 rating, this is NOT for children. However, everybody else is just great.",1
"< br / > < br / > Highly recommended. Cross is also very good, carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture. It also hasn't dated that much either. Watch it with lights out!",1
"Even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work. Often classed as a "" horror movie "" this, I believe, is a grave error. < br / > < br / > Paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film I've ever seen. To be honest, I make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste, stop reading now because there's more to come.",1

This film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks. Any other film, this song would have had close - ups of both of them. Then Meena Kumari died and it just brought the crowds rolling in. Notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the Chalo dildar songs, very unusual.",1

A few years later, murders begin to occur... < br / > < br / > Even though he only made two Giallo's, Miraglia does have his own set of tributes. The plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting, before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle. We've got more of the Giallo side of the equation this time around, although Miraglia doesn't lose the Gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight.",1
Their music and cinematography leaves you spell bound.,1
"Pakeezah is surely pinnacle of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled. Characters are well - developed, direction, although sometimes unrefined by today's standards, perceptive and convincing.",1
"< br / > < br / > The cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of Josef Werching that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entirety. He had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without Meena's close ups, because Meena Kumari, the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early 1971.",1
"Without question, this film has to be one of the greatest........ in cinematic history. < br / > < br / > Where does one begin?",1
"In some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face. At the very least watch Pakeeza At last - I've finally got round to it and managed to see a "" clean "" copy of Pakeezah! I've seldom heard such serious, beautiful, poetic, wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack.",1
"Whether one likes it or not, this is the only fair conclusion that be deduced from this particular film. It is because in Hong Sang Soo's film, there are no actual shots of wars, troubles and conflicts.",1
"< br / > < br / > One thing that's clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism. I think the think I've come to love about Hong's films is that they just feel so real, especially the complex and conflicted characters. Technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear. This film doesn't pack the same emotional wallop that the first does, < br / > < br / > This is not a fast moving film. It's a rather hard balance to keep and it's surprising how Hong manages to pull it off twice in a row.",1
"This is a great film. If this is any indication, than Hong Sang - Soo really is "" Asian cinema's best kept secret "". Plus, it doesn't keep it's subjects quite as detached as Hou does.",1

Many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list English subtitles. Pity.,1
"I liked this movie,, cute and funny. Sorry to say that to the Yankee's fans.",1
Not too bad. Check them both out. The movie is a fairly interesting look at how world events can affect peoples'relationships.,1

I got it for two quid in Blockbusters so I was happy. This then leads in the Ben ( teacher ) and Lindsey dating. But it isn't all simple when he confesses he is a massive Red Sox fan.,1
I never thought it could be done.,1
"OK, I would not normally watch a Farrelly brothers movie. I can't recall ever watching one. How sad is that?",1
"Ben is not just a fan but a "" fanatic "" who travels to Fort Meyers, Florida each winter for the Red Sox Spring Training games and never misses a home game during the regular season. While the premise of Fever Pitch is that some things are more important than baseball ( perish the thought ), you would never know it from the way things turn out.",1
). I love and admire the Farrelly brothers! But in this movie - the vibes get you.,1
"I thought the ending was a little abrupt. All around, it was a cute movie with likable characters. Big Fat Greek wedding ; Me, Myself & Irene ).",1
What? ) I think Fever Pitch will help him out a lot. Australian soap operas? I never wanted him to leave SNL but what can you do? Everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies. ( Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie? Here's wishing Jimmy a successful career on screen. Busom Buddies?,1
It does notpoil the story telling.,1
"The love is between the two young lovers. For the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie. He is funny enough and gets the most laughs. The lust is for the Red Sox winning the world series.",1
"Rather than accept Lindsey's - rather urgent - request to reschedule, Ben sticks around to play nurse, orderly, and janitor. Lindsey is a corporate, career orientated kind of girl, but she has a kind of cuteness that Ben finds totally endearing. < br / > < br / > Jimmy Fallen giving his best performance to date stars as Ben, a dorky, lightly nerdy schoolteacher. The film is not really about baseball ; rather, it's really about relationships, and the emotional disconnectedness that can often take place. So Ben scrubs the toilet and the dog's teeth, while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bed.",1
"< br / > < br / > Fallon was credible enough Well, I'm sad to admit, they are not. Let's say "" Fever Pitch "" might trick you into believing it's a baseball movie. I read the Chronicle's sports section every day. Enter the Boston Red Sox. Yes, commitment.",1
Or was another team in the frame?,1
< br / > < br / > It's funny movie and you won't strike out if you rent this one. I really liked this movie because I have a husband just like the guy in this movie. Also the people he sits with at the baseball games are just as obsessed as he is.,1
"but this movie did not follow that mold. The movie shocked me. I'll simply say i like it. It's no "" My fair lady "" but it is a spirited and honest film. There were no ex's popping up or characters threatening the relationship. The best thing about the movie is it's consistency with the relationship.",1
"She refuses to believe the Sox won it legitimately. One more strike, and it's back to SNL! "" You'll walk out of the theater and never go back! "" The mere mention of Pedro Martinez'name sends me running to the bathroom. It's the joy of being a sports fan. "" Then the movie had to go and be way more entertaining than I was expecting. Well, figuratively speaking. My whole family hates'em.",1
After the party Ben tells her it was'the best night of his life '. It both makes them both realize how serious they are getting and she begins to question if this is the person she wants to be with. 'Everything goes great between Ben and Lindsay the whole winter but then baseball season starts.,1
"Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of film. The Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter, are at it again.",1
"Their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a refreshingly grown - up way, from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him, centered around that they are both facing thirty and single. Fallon surprisingly rises to his character'gradual emotional maturity. < br / > < br / > It is even set up credibly how she meets Jimmy Fallon's math teacher and how she falls for his "" winter guy "" - - though it's surprising that his Red Sox paraphernalia filled apartment didn't tip her off to his Jekyll - and - Hyde "" summer guy. """,1
)... don't ask why! : ) Movies like that are excellent.,1
There is even a guy meets girl's pet dog scene. I rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy.,1
"This film is probably best characterized as a sweet, light comedy. That says something in itself.",1
"It was really funny, and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best performance. I would definitely recommend it!",1
"Fallon's portrayal "" made "" the movie. We expect that from her and she delivered. Kinda spongy? "" Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection. It's a terrific make - you - laugh flick. Go see it!",1
At the end the kingpin landowner appears and attempts to murder Tollinger with his own hands. Watchable results for this offbeat Western. Check all hardware at the marshal's office ¨.,1
Man With The Gun is nice Mitchum western and is easily worth one's time. The entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable.,1
"Yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments, both technically and as a functioning story. < br / > < br / > Robert Mitchum is in the lead as Tollinger, perfectly cast, he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace. Whilst here, the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of Tollinger's reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer.",1
"And most of all, emotion is on the rendezvous.",1
Favourite bit : the sudden demise of 2 of the baddies in the Red Dog saloon.,1
Very good western.,1
'Man with the gun'is one of his best. there should be a sub - genre in the Western called'the Robert Mitchum Western '.,1
This film makes a strong comment about the Italian people of the time. I love them both.,1
The meeting of two different worlds. A clear masterpiece. May 1938. A story about solitude and silence.,1
"Gabriele is simply an Anti - Fascist. I don't want to spoil anymore about the plot : go looking for this film! And so, yesterday night, my mum and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors.",1
"Both of them need company and understanding, both f them find it in each other. Don't miss it.",1
First of all for this movie I just have one word :'wow '. Simply amazing - 9 / 10.,1
A true masterpiece of cinema!! All men would really feel sorry for Sophia Loren's character. ! He acts as real man who does not beg for pity.,1
"And why isn't it available on VHS or DVD? But - Why is it not better known? Thank you, IMDb! This is a real masterpiece!",1
Usually his films take place on a few stages and are semi - theatrical. Emotive musical score by Armando Trovajoly with sensitive leitmotif. The film won deservedly Golden Globes 1978 to best Foreign Film. She's left alone in her home when her spouse must to attend the historical celebration. Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Pascualino De Santis.,1
"This was also one of 14 collaborations with that other most widely - recognized star to emerge from Italy, Sophia Loren ; both, incidentally, are playing against type here - she as an unglamorous housewife and he a homosexual!",1
"Antonietta feels what we feel. Antonietta's bird escapes and flies to Gabriele's apartment, and this is how the two meet. The reason for that I will not reveal. We understand her questions, although we can't be sure what her intentions are. What does this man want from her? Loren plays the scenes very good as well. She likes attention anyway. < br / > < br / > Like I said, Mastroianni has a wonderful performance. She is a member of Mussolini's party, pretty fanatic in her thoughts, and he is a member no more. This is a movie you should see. '",1
"But as a gay man, he is no longer part of it, he's about to be arrested. She thinks she should be happy.",1
The superb acting between Mastroianni & Loren. My vote is 10 / 10. < br / > < br / > I like many things about the film.,1
"< br / > < br / > Every once in a while, you come across a film that really touches a nerve. Time Out calls it'rubbish'and Leonard Maltin, somewhat milder,'pleasant but trifling. It's surprising Ettore Scola's "" Una giornate particulare "" is relatively unheralded, even hated by some critics. Canadian born John Vernon plays Loren's husband, but he is only on screen in the first and last scene. During the whole film, we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard. He is well - mannered, cultured and soon she is attracted to him. Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings. A SPECIAL DAY ( Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977 ).",1
Even during the end - titles the theater remained completely silent. And a big loss if you haven't seen it ( yet )... A wonder of refinement. < br / > < br / > This SPECIAL DAY is truly special.,1
A masterpiece.,1
The reason? Mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend.,1
"His mother repeatedly scolds him, but it does no good. But make no mistake about it, they do some neat things here. < br / > < br / > Anyway, not the greatest cartoon, but worth seeing.",1
"Entirely shot in natural locations in the Mediterranean. Strange that he was never offered roles of this dimension afterwards. The cast is brilliant and international here. As it was already put, the best version ever of Homer's epic.",1
"I highly recommend this. how??? CotHK does say it starts 5 years after the War of Heros which Parn was a part of. As far as sequels go though, I highly recommend CotHK. Perhaps I missed something during the coarse of the series that explained that part.",1
"), which is a nice bonus. Much of the original cast who lent their English voices to the characters of LODOSS return ( including Lisa Ortiz as Deedlit! So I had significant hopes for the dub for CHRONICLES, made in 1999 - 2000. ), this TV follow - up is still great fun for fantasy fans. For most part, the LODOSS TV English track is of passable ( if not stellar ) quality ; it does, however, have its share of problems. The first eight episodes of this 27 - part TV series focus on the fateful battle at Demon Dragon Mountain.",1
"< br / > < br / > The only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation. Cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous populations in New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo up until only 40 years before this film was made but has been long abandoned by human civilization. Its time to pay tribute to the great Charton Heston after his recent passing but this film is not the one.",1
"In terms of the arts, the 1970s were a very turbulent era.",1

< br / > < br / > 8 out of 10. The plot isn't too polished.,1
"Soylent Green is a classic. 6 billion and growing.... that's obscene. Despite all diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc.",1
This movie came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening.,1
"Soylent Green "" is one of the better ones.",1
"( Watch for the graphic circumcision scene ). This film shows what can be done shot on video. Who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong? One can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselves. Documenting a documenter. This film follows anthropologist Tobias Schneebaum, who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago, first to West Papua and then Peru. The editing provides a quiet revelation of Tobias'life that leaves you watching in fascination.",1

Soylent Green I found to be an excellent movie.,1
"Is this the future that awaits us? The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty. < br / > < br / > The characters are wonderful. An overpopulated, unforgiving wasteland with a hellish, unwanted existence? I could definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes.",1
"Truly amazing film, the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening.",1
"Succinct and unambiguous, it's truly memorable. < br / > < br / > This is one smart film, and its core message is as pertinent today as it was in the early 70s.",1
"Overpopulation, air pollution, year - long heat waves, and food shortages are the rule. Make Room! "" The world of the 1973 sci - fi drama SOYLENT GREEN is what we could be seeing if we aren't careful. Heston believes that this wasn't just a garden - variety murder, that Cotten was bumped off for a reason. The only hope comes from a food product called Soylent Green. But what is this particular food stuff really made of?",1
His reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave - taking were very moving.,1
"The first is a food executive named William R. Simonson ( Joseph Cotton ). The time is the future and for many not aware of it, that day is now.",1
I was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies. Overpopulation means there ` s too many people to feed?,1
"At the time it was actually a huge box office success. This was a very thought provoking film, especially for 1973.",1
For myself it also shows the Right to Life ethic run amuck. Environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming. We've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive. It's latest product is Soylent Green. Obviously there's no family planning in this world either.,1
"Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? I bet this is one of Tarantino's favourites. A priest taking confession and being shot by confessor. But Soylent Green is in a whole other league. Luckily, I saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare.",1
"This is the only movie I know of that has such polarized views based on gender. Plus, it features Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to Heston. However, the film has a great plot and acting and is super - exciting to watch.",1
Very interesting. The big twist wasn't as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working. It really got me thinking about a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world I live in a lot more.,1
"I don't really like Heston in his sci - fi efforts. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. Soylent Green IS... a really good movie, actually.",1
< br / > < br / > Its reputation should be better. It was always one of my favorite sci - fi and / or Charlton Heston films. The film also looks so much better in a great 35mm print. I just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years.,1

"Marlene Dietrich gives nicely done, though restrained, performance here and looks gorgeous. Basil Rathbone is fine here, except given very little to do.",1
"At any rate, it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on DVD. All of them combined to give us one of the best - looking films of the classic - era age. I can't say for sure, but this might have been the first one ( 3 - strip ). Just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the DVD. In fact, just how good it looks is amazing. I can't say more without spoiling things.",1
"That being said, the film is worth seeing just as visual treat.",1
Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie. In terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding!,1
"He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! I can't help but think he would have been wonderful. She look great ; Boyer looks young and trim. As others have noted, John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich.",1

There is no director I like more than Mamoru Oshii.

"There is no such a thing as perfect murder. Lieutenant Columbo knows that. Back for one more question. But he could. Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. So no remakes, please. Steven Bochco wrote it.",1
"This is the Columbo that got directed by Steven Spielberg at an early point in his career. At least that's the feeling this movie left me with. Not that its bad, of course it isn't but as I said earlier, it also isn't anything too sensational. The story however didn't really explored all of its possibilities. The movie is basically in the same style as most of Spierlberg's'70's movies and TV works.",1
Casting Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was sheer brilliance. His charismatic personality was highly infectious.,1
"Along with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was an iconic Columbo villain. But this is still a great episode.",1
The first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least. However it improved afterwards as the Valentine Party commenced. The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore.,1
"< br / > < br / > Now, both demises are true - life MYSTERIES!",1
"Jack Cassidy would appear in a later Columbo. It is very entertaining to watch Cassidy and Falk as always. Rather than losing more money, he kills her.",1

Being the Beatlemaniac that I am, I approached Two Of Us with a combination of fear and fascination. Most certainly recommended.",1

"This is a "" B Series "" Film Noir, and my vote reflects its membership in that genre. At least it does for me. The film has some flaws, yes, but far too many delicious elements to ignore. ( B - movies could tread where A - movies were forbidden to enter! ) And the plot is intriguing.",1
"Cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance. This WAS a doozy, I must say. One hopes, of course, that HE was not influenced by any drugs at time! Other reviewers have summarized this film noir well.",1
"The real standout of the film, however, is Franchot Tone, who provides a memorable performance as the insane villain of the piece. He picks up a lady in a big hat in a bar one night, and the two agree to a'no strings attached'night of fun. Phantom Lady focuses on Scott Henderson ; a man married to a woman he doesn't like.",1

Scott's wife has been murdered. Sometimes these are the best kind of dates. Ella Raines is good in the female lead role and Thomas Gomez makes a likable policeman. < br / > < br / > This is a good film and the viewer is 100 % behind the attempts of Kansas to get to the truth.,1
"These two then form an alliance to prove Scott's alibi. I rated this film 7 / 10 which is an average of 8 / 10 for screenplay, direction and 1944 production values and 6 / 10 for acting. He had however designed children's homes and playgrounds so I suppose "" family man "" had lit up in Carol's brain.",1
He looks ghastly and he's just horrible. She's pretty and full of life. Tone gives dreadful performance. A really great film - - flaws aside.,1

"It may not even sneak into the top fifty. Little by little she starts putting pieces of a murder mystery puzzle together. As good as Raines is, it is this scene that makes this film noteworthy. 'Kansas'is Anderson's secretary by day and amateur detective by night.",1
"Alan Curtis didn't seem upset that he might die and didn't seem happy that he lived. The shadows, lighting effects, and camera angles are all effective. Franchot Tone phoned this one in. And he does it, I might add, without a lot of help from his male actors, i. e., Curtis and Tone. It's this scene that brings "" Phantom Lady "" into new territory.",1
"She holds her own against much more experienced actors. He is effective as the accused man's best friend. The killer is not revealed until the end. Scott Henderson, the engineer that employs Carol Richman, as his assistant, makes a point to call her "" Kansas "", whenever he speaks to her.",1
"A movie with many twists and dark alleyways, none of which I will mention! Sadly not available on DVD as yet, but worth pursuing on TCM or VHS.",1
He is no stock villain. She definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. Recommended 8 / 10. Nevertheless I was engaged by the hook of the Phantom Lady. The rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent.,1

"And most of the songs are often a lot of fun, and catchy, and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself. It'd be easy to call Guys and Dolls great. If it's not entirely as great as some others of its ilk, it shouldn't be any fault of the filmmaker Joseph L. Mankiewicz. So, he has only one choice to host the game, with a thousand dollar tab.",1

"The scenes between her and Sinatra were obvious. ). This musical was not quite what I expected, foremost being there weren't many scenes between Brando and Sinatra. He wasn't great but he was just fine in the role. It wasn't until Brando goes to her office that the story came to life. I really didn't expect much from Brando as a singer, but he surprised me.",1

Thus, Zizola goes out to save her father by stopping her stepmother from finding another suitor at the ball by distracting the men who come her way.",1
Everything but production values.,1
"Side stories happen because they do, and that's how life is. Most films would never even expect such a thing of you. Scene after scene captures some detail, some little bit of visual magic that takes your breath away. Much like early John Sayles films, characters are given space to breathe, time to talk. But to have Juan Ruiz Anchía behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty. And you can almost never say that. < br / > < br / > The acting ties much of this story together.",1
I felt good. I felt his role should have been elaborated. They were so realistic. Both did NOT deal with their problems effectively. I could NOT really feel sorry for these two.,1
"It is VERY depressing until pretty much the very end. It is truly a blessing for the poor kid to have that one someone he can turn to. < br / > < br / > But they just can't. Grandpa seems to be able to speak to the boy without judgements or even kid gloves. It's so easy to judge and to be angry and to feel someone is "" made of stone "" just because they don't grieve in a way we believe they ought.",1
"It's pretty lifelike, yet you think "" It's only a movie. """,1
"His family seems to shun him. After while, Arnold even moves in with the old timer. Second man then passes him the gun through the fence. The Stone Boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s. Arnold's parents don't seem to understand how to deal with their son. They really don't even try to talk to him.",1
"Great! He does this with an element of humour, Plenty of twists, thrills and blood.",1
"Something we don't get to do alot of with today'films. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hate. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. < br / > < br / > What I loved about this film : the lack of dialog.",1
"< br / > < br / > The Stone Boy is well worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it. The dialogue is sparse but telling, and the nonverbal acting is outstanding.",1
The performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced.,1
Maybe a sequel could eliminate bad ending. The actors were great and displayed wonderful talent.,1
I want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it. Our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you. < br / > < br / > This is Heather's mom.,1
"Thum up! How far will you go to protect your friends? How much can You lose if you stud by an innocent girl? Lie, kill? Can love beat the odds?",1
"10 / 10 Recommended. I saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me. All of the actors in this film, which was inspired by actual events, did a great job. Caitlin is in a popular high school clique, but when she reveals she is raped the clique turns against her, led by Ethan ( played by Brian Austin Green ).",1
"I would have loved it to turn out a little different! Never mind though, good gripping story.",1
"I enjoyed it very much. When I saw this movie, I was amazed that it was only a TV movie. I think this movie should have been in theaters.",1
This is the kind of film that doesn't get exposure it deserves.,1
I gave it a 8 / 10. That's how good it is.,1
I finally watched it this week and what a delight. Adrian and her coach were also quite good. All she needs to do is find her place where she be who she is and the ring helps her to get there.,1
Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent.,1
"I recommend it to be seen. You could tell that she was a tough woman. She is more a bad girl and that's what I like about her. Even though they don't think she has the potential, they get to be shown proven wrong. Michelle Rodrigez was made for this movie, when I first saw her in Fast and the Furious. < br / > < br / > I think this movie was a little slow at ending, but was well done.",1
"Diana is a feminist. Thanks, Michelle.",1
"But the ending wasn't a disappointment either. In this movie, it shows it at the amature level. Highly recommended.",1
"This movie is a real gem. Until the climax, that is. Check out this movie. I gave it an 8.",1
I couldn't believe the character Oprah played at the age of 35! And I adore Whoopi to start with - she was amazing.,1
"Super. These quibbles apart, however, the film is a dream.",1
"I never had the idea that the main character was exaggerating her position as a woman. I can't really explain why, but especially in the love scenes she convinced me. But I was wrong. It just looked real I think.",1
"Although her later films pigeonhole her to that same role, this film was made for her ruggedness. Great work.",1
"< br / > < br / > It would be easy to call this movie a "" Rocky with girls "" i guess. Sure she's a female boxer, but rather it's the more sensitive moments that really makes her shine. I rate this 7 / 10. She just can't stay away from fighting. But that is not at all what this is about. How positive things can make you grow.",1
"Girlfight "" is much more of a coming - of - age - story than it is a fight flick. < br / > < br / > ( originally written 10 / 7 / 2000 )",1
It really impressed me. I think she and Adrian were great actors. Is the end.,1
it made a big impression on me and i know i'm not the only one. actors are good. but the thoughts that it can spark are what make it above average in my opinion. < br / > < br / > so plot is familiar / common.,1
Very convincing might I say. I really enjoyed Girl Fight. I thought it ended just right. I felt the passion the y had for one another. Even though he loved her he was really hateful.,1
"< br / > < br / > Much to my surprise it wasn't about that at all. For starters, her brother's coach doesn't want to take on a female boxer. Needless to say, I didn't watch "" Hart's War "" that night.",1
"Aside from that, Girlfight is great movie.",1
Diana did not like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave her mother. In her high school there is plenty of friction between her female classmates and guys. It is the later outcome to my viewing the entire film from beginning to end.,1
< br / > < br / > I own it and I watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation. ! 11 Oscar nominations and zero win!!,1
"All Diana wants is to be treated like any other guy. Genius, pure effing'genius. Not looked down upon because she is a woman. She steals money from her father to begin training. She wants to box.",1
"I saw this movie after i saw Blue Crush and other of Michelle's movies, i thought she had a bleak future in this business.",1
"They meet after class, so to speak, and feel attracted to each other. No sex. < br / > < br With their narrow hips they can run faster. Santiago has been instructed to save it for his next bout. Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring. That will be ten cents, PayPal preferred. I speak to you as your anthropologist. < br / > < br / > That's why I called this gender - blind program misguided.",1
"We quickly get introduced to student Diana Guzman ( Michelle Rodriguez ). Really good. In fact, this may have brought the genre to its apex. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. < br / > < br / > All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. Her older brother has already gotten into boxing, but her father most likely won't approve.",1
"Watch them roll their eyes at the string of clichés, and they're right : it * is * clichéd. Definiately worth a look.",1
"I had heard it was good, but not this good. On an errand to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is captivated by boxing.",1
"She's perfect. She also brings across genuine toughness. She doesn't fit in. So as a boxing movie, it fails. A lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. Big deal. Women's boxing has been around a long time.",1
So much so you can almost smell the sweat.,1
"Diana has found her element. Ultimately, with Tiny's help she finds a way, and the ring soon becomes her second home. Which is exactly what a young Latino girl does in ` Girlfight,'written and directed by Karyn Kusama.",1
"Ebert to the contrary, this movie is a success.",1
It should have swept the Oscars that year.,1
! It was great!,1
"Very nice. The camera - work is slow and sweet. When they put this movie together, they left out anything that wasn't necessary. I knew I was going to see this when I saw the first preview.",1
Most definate.,1
I believe this movie will be classic. Dennis Quaid played the role to perfection. The excitement is palpable. Follow your dreams.,1
The music rocks and carries the story magnificently! The on - screen chemistry works. 8 / 10.,1
Overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without.,1
AP What a fun movie experience!,1
There were a few charged symbols to look for. The cinematography was acceptable. It expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story.,1
!,1
< br / > < br / > Warning! < br / > < br / > The cast is amazing. You can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood. She has given birth two children for her father. Celie's story is a true survival story. I have never seen him a such an evil role.,1
< br / > < br / > 5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie.,1
Definite worth a full price ticket and a couple hours of your time! I walked out of the theatre totally delighted and somewhat surprised.,1
"it is inspirational, but doesn't pour it on too thick. this is a great family film. this a great Disney flick.",1
"It is a beautiful and inspirational film. It rates two thumbs up and a big "" well done. """,1
"This was truly a great movie. You can't do anything, but root for this guy.",1
"Unlike "" The Natural, "" "" The Rookie "" shuns swearing, sex, and violence. Morris attained his dream when he debuted on the mound as a relief pitcher in 1999. These movies neither insulted your intelligence no manipulated your emotions. < br / > < br / > Moreover, rugged Dennis Quaid plays a real - life individual. A wildcat oil prospector convinces two Catholic nuns back in the 1920s to bankroll a West Texas well. Fearing they have blown their bucks on an ill - advised Essentially, "" The Rookie "" resembles the 1984 Robert Redford saga "" The Natural "" about an old - time slugger who makes a comeback. The heroes differed little from the crowd. They shared the same feelings and bore the same burdens. Since the 1970s, the film industry has pretty much written off G - rated movies for adults.",1
"This movie, to me, is about family. She'd think it was the coolest thing, like Morris'son did.",1
It has it all and more. Rating : 10 of 10.,1
"Dennis Quaid is just downright purdy in the part, and a baseball movie with a good - looking man changing a diaper is my idea of heaven. Ladies, if you feel way I do, check this one out. This is one of my favorite sports movies. It is moving and inspiring, and the man's relationships ring true.",1
"The participants are believable and capable. The characters and actors are likable, realistic and present fine performances. Most important, I believe, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looked good both throwing and swinging a bat in "" The Natural, and so did Kevin Costner in "" For Love of the Game "" and "" Bull Durham. "" It is a "" feel good "" story.",1
"< br / > < br / > These are just normal people who have dreams like you and I. < br / > < br / > If you're looking for a change of pace, then pick this movie up. Since then I must've watched it at least three times. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never disappoints. The people in Big Lake TX seem so personable that I want to move there. He rushes over and reaches out to his family. < br / > < br / > As I said b4, the film doesn't try to go overboard with sentimentality.",1
It took place right here in Texas!,1
"The movie really isn't about baseball but about one man's quest to reach his dream. The baseball scenes are fun, well - filmed, and portrayed excellently. < br > < br / > The Rookie. I liked it, I hope you do. It's inspiring, it's emotional, and it's funny. It is a great underdog story and a very friendly family movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > Good job all around, glad to see it hit. It took guts.",1
"< br / > < br / > Morris's team is struggling and he lectures them about giving up on their dreams. After another try out with the team, Morris is offered a contract with the Devil Rays. At several times when he pitches to them in practice, they express amazement at the speed with which he throws.",1
"I love it when they actually do a sports story well. Not this one. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who could fire it 90 - plus miles per hour.",1
"It's one heck of thrill ride. I'm not really a big fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I liked "" Pandora's Clock "".",1
All in all highly recommended film.,1
I dare you to watch this film and not be moved! Her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sister. < br / > < br / > The husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from Celie's life. She has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth. The film The Color Purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story.,1
"I had originally made - - and copied over - - a VHS tape of this wonderful TV presentation. That, in itself, is a rare achievement for TV movies. Each day, I waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read. < br / > < br / > Secondly, I agree with others about the casting. Sometimes, Lady Luck smiles on me.",1
"Daphne Zuniga is great as Dr. Sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it works incredibly well. This will leave you breathless. < br / > < br / > Despite being made for TV, this is first rate entertainment.",1
"It could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen. I was wrong. If you get a chance to see this movie, invest the time - - nearly four hours. You will be rich rewarded!",1
!,1
"Well - acted, even by Elizabeth Berkley.",1
"De Sica is becoming one of my favorite directors, but this one was a hit - and - miss for me.",1
now I KNOW it's a fantasy ). If you have trouble suspending disbelief then this isn't for you.,1
"It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it is a lovable hilarious comedy, with good music. Less sex and less realism, but a tale with great humanism and warmth.",1
But what I saw just broke all my expectations - in a good way. What is he going to do to protect his friends and all built city as well? Our character gets a wonder dove from his dead mother.,1
"In any case, take a look at it.",1
"And it is said "" the meek shall inherit the earth. "" ! Gracias!",1
Magnificent. Cinema in its purest form.,1
"Unless you are a total curmudgeon, you'll have a ball. This is a really strange film - - and that is NOT a bad thing.",1
"I think I read this was widely criticized at the time of its release. 10 / 10. It's quite amazing, and very funny. Toto is optimistic, though, and won't let anything get him down. Immediately, he finds that he has no home.",1
"The mistakes made by the McGann T. V. movie were well learnt. B. C.'s flagship programmes. Its the planet Saurious - 7. Well, I never! "".",1
"Also, we have our first cliffhanger ; not the best of ones admittedly. < br / > < br / > EPISODE THREE : "" The Unquiet Dead "" - We've had the future, now lets have the past. Finally the Doctor's companion gets a credible back story and a strong character. They did it.",1
"Run for your life! < br / > < br / > The real triumph of this episode, though, is Piper's performance : in theory "".",1
"For example, Porky's came out of it. However, in order to get the money he needs a American name star. For Canadians 8 / 10 for the rest of the world 5 / 10.",1
"Alan Bates captures this mindset perfectly as Michael Baytes, and I will immortally remember Bates as this character. This is a movie for Canadians and Americans alike.",1
"A great egotistical has - been, Michael Baytes, who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran, is offered the lead part, which turns to be a disaster. "" < br / > < br / > The filming process is hilarious, and acting, in general, is good.",1
"Films involve tens, if not hundreds, of people. < br / > < br / > A 10 out of 10 from me. The script is flawless and the performances are top notch.",1
"I love And this film has them! < br / > < br / > Now let's get onto the content. Back in 2004 I saw "" True "", Tom Tykwer's contribution to Paris Je T'aime. When I saw it I loved it and became thrilled. I love surprises!",1
"Each piece is named after a different Parisian neighborhood and is a reflection on love. And truly, what better way to express the fleeting nature of love and how a moment can change your life than with a collection of filmed moments. His father, a The results are spontaneously romantic and surprisingly consistent.",1
"The stories vary from hilarious, to humorous, to touching, to tragic, to banal, to tender. Ask a large group of people their impressions of life in Paris and the result would be something akin to this film. Paris, JE T'AIME is a wondrous cinematic homage to the city of light and the city of love, a film so complex that it almost defies summarization and reviewing.",1
"Absolutely perfect, and very, very funny, without Buscemi having to say a word. Possibly my only criticism of the whole film, is that it makes Paris look too good. I took my 19 year old daughter with me to see this interesting exercise in movie making. But I wish I had.",1
Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in'Place des Victoires'was haunting. < br / > < br / > There are also a number of memorable quotes.,1
Nor enough of the romance!,1
I absolutely loved it.,1
"Almost all of the segments are powerful, complete, and satisfying. The premise works. < br / > < br / > This is an outstanding movie. Paris, je t'aime ( 2006 ) is a film made up of 18 segments.",1
"bring some great sharp wit and sarcasm as they meet to discuss their impending divorce. < br / > < br / > Quatier Latin : Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands ( recreating relationship from an old Cassavettes film? ) Whether it be the big name support or the project itself, Paris je t'aime never falls into this realm. I believe I can truly say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts. < br / > < br / > Tuileries : The Coen Brothers stick to their strange sense of humor and deliver some fine laughs.",1
"Place des Fêtes "", by Oliver Schmitz, feat. Witty and delightful. < br / > < br / > 2. """,1
"I would include into this category the humorous short film by Gus Van Sant. ... for Paris is a moveable feast. "" < br / > < br / > Some of the vignettes are poignant and even dark.",1
Just watch it.,1
"18 directors of 18 seemingly unrelated vignettes about love in the city of lights. Don't miss Alexander Payne ( director of "" Sideways "" ) as Oscar Wilde. A very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust to as a viewer. Greetings again from the darkness.",1
< br / > < br / > Parc Monceau : Nick Nolte is great. < br / > < br / > I've spend 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back! Ludivine Sagnier also.,1
"The stories vary from all out romance to quirky comedy to Alex Payne's touching study of a woman discovering herself to Van Sant and one of those things that happens anywhere.. maybe? Several brought up some emotions for me... Nothing really off putting by having French spoken in most sequences ( with English subtitles ) and a small amount of actual English spoken, though that will probably relegate it to art houses ( a la Diva. ) All easy to follow ( unless the "" experimental "" one irritates your desire for a formulaic story.",1
The Color Purple is a masterpiece.,1
"As far as everything else is concerned I can only say - captivating. Makes you want to leave everything behind you, flee to Paris and live those little romances yourself. And its most important quality is the fact that it is not soppy at all, but rather warm and full of hope.",1
The whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts. No problem.,1
"And not to forget the all over topic of love! All in all I can absolutely recommend this great collage and will be looking forward to its release on DVD. Love between the characters, love between the characters and Paris and also the love of the directors and actors / actresses for this project. The stories were chosen carefully with regard to their matching Arrondissement and express the respective flair perfectly. I watched this movie a couple of days ago in a small independent cinema in Paris.",1
"< br / > < br / > TUILERIES - an entertaining sequence by the Coen brothers. Beautiful. It's not easy making a movie with 18 different stories in it. < br / > < br / > LES MARAIS - this was a huge disappointment! A man finds a parking spot, and sees a lot of odd couples walking by, wondering why he can't find a girl. If I understood it correctly Really basic, but with a sweet heart to it. < br / > < br / > LOIN DU 16IEME - a beautiful story too, even if the execution is poor, the heart is there. Some kind of shampoo salesman arrives in a Chinatown - lookalike place in Paris.",1
It's not too painful to sit through the bad sections - they only last 5 minutes anyway. ! The Tom Tykwer clip was also impressive although rather ambitious in its scope. < br / > < br / > Ca vaut la peine!,1
"I was lucky enough to attend a screening in Stockholm for this elegantly expressed, enjoyable, and thought - provoking film. Instead simply rest assured that each director graces the film with their eccentric styles and skills, and certainly you'll find your favourite.",1
"< br / > < br / > This movie was amazing, to say the least. Although I live in Minnesota, I have been studying in France lately and came across this bizarre gem of a film. yet also leaves them satisfied that it did, indeed, occur. The number of people that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of love. It's the kind of movie where the viewer, upon leaving the theater, can't actually decide whether they loved it or they hated it.",1
"I caught this movie on the Sundance Channel on cable one late afternoon. < br / > < br / > Looks like the official site is still available at "" wholovesthesun. After all, it's all in the family, and the film sure doesn't take itself too seriously.",1
Weekly. this is destined to be a real indie gem.,1
"It's been a while since I've found such a thoroughly touching, thoroughly enjoyable film. < br / > < br / > I recommend "" Who Loves The Sun. """,1
Im a testament to that.,1
Another good Stooge short!,1
His only rival is Andrew Blake. I highly recommend this movie & gave it a 9.,1
"Run out to your video store and pick up today. Additionally, the doctor's office scene is well done.",1
"In doing so, he raised the heat to a level that had eluded Big A ever since his first and IMHO best film NIGHT TRIPS.

"The swap scene that closes out the offering ain't bad either. Recommended. Technically, the production values are fairly high.",1
"7 rating on this film. < br / > < br / > The plot is fairly standard but effectively executed. Great full nude scene of her, too.",1
"Altman's touch with zooms in and out were there, and I expected those devices to comment on characters and situations. I found myself at sixes and sevens while watching this one. On the whole, the zooms were, well, inconsistent, and sometimes even trite. Was he muzzled in by mammonist producers, perhaps?",1
Downey is likable as a private detective.,1
"< br / > < br / > Also starring Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. < br / > < br / > Grade : B "" The Gingerbread Man "" is nowhere near as good as that film, but it holds up fairly well on its own. < br / > < br / > Altman had tipped his hat to the mystery thriller with noir overtones before, in his 1973 film "" The Long Goodbye. "" But this southern - fried pot - boiler is pretty good.",1
"But this movie, without a doubt, is definitely one of the best films of all time. I laughed, cried, and got angry.",1
"Robert Altman is my favorite American director. He is more of a maverick. I have even enjoyed his one - act TV movies, like "" The Dumb Waiter "" and "" The Laundromat "". He is not your typical mainstream purveyor of fantasies.",1
"Instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys. The Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I've ever done! """,1
"as the private detective in Branaugh's employ. endings, or just a such a semi - conventional thriller.

Simp one of the best thrillers of the year.,1
Very well done. Crockzilla scene anyone?,1
< br / > < br / > The cinematography is just... too perfect for my liking. Too coral filter ( or charcoal ) for my liking... too archly framed 12mm.,1
I only hope I get to see Cracker Bag again some day.,1
The follow up is always the most difficut thing. Cheers to all. Enjoy your cinema.,1
It wasn't your typical war flick but something a bit different. This was a good movie.,1
"Just caught it at the Toronto International Film Festival. This is a good story, told in a compelling way.",1
"Along way, we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption. I encourage anyone of any race to see this film. Danny Glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film.",1
Yet it can not be labeled as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of Bozz and others. Joel schumacher Made a heck of a choice when he decided on this cast and this script.,1
< br / > < br / > Lars.,1
Not just about Nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being'in the army '. < br / > < br / > Fantastic film. We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.,1
The character of Boz makes this movie so good. It is a shame it did not get a major release.,1
"< br / > < br / > It's not a great film, but neither is it bad film.",1
"Never heard of this movie, saw it on DVD. HA! It concentrated on people who were sent to fight.",1
"But the Academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didn't give Spielberg any respect. "" Why Academy voters were so hard on not nominating Spielberg for Best Director is a mystery that still puzzles me today. But he should have gotten nominated for this movie. That wasn't right. "" Like Goldberg, what a film debut! It also made me laugh at times too.",1
"I love this movie from top to bottom. I don't why Tigerland is heavily under - credited. Keep the rare gems coming Hollywood, 10 / 10.",1
To me this was Colin Farrells best movie evr!,1
Enjoyable and entertaining film to view.,1
I like him in most of his movies but in this one he was incredible. I bought the DVD immediately after renting it.,1
"The dehumanising effect of war is a much - studied subject in the movies ; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life - saving, dehumanising effect of military training.",1
"Perfect irony. Really touching story of a recruitment camp in America, where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war. < br / > < br / > The acting is truly exceptional, and the documentary - style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie.",1
"Other more obscure examples include Kubrick and Welles who covered too much to write about here. Batman is a superhero ; superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me. With war genre, laughter isn't something you'd associate with it for most of the time.",1
"Others, not so much. < br / > < br / > From the very beginning to the very end. it was a very gritty movie, through and through. Constant moving, constant action, and just constant confusion.",1
"< br / > < br / > I would want to know Joel Schumacher's experiences with the army. Are the men really this unabashed and brutal? It ends when the soldiers finally go to war, kind of disappointing since witnessing characters in action would have served as a supurb payoff. This film is specifically about the preparation for war, nothing more nothing less.",1
"I really like this movie. This film, however, is not set in a war zone, but in a pre - war combat prep training.",1
"this movie is such a moving, amazing piece of work. you laugh, you cry, you cheer... it brings out every emotion imaginable.",1
The movie was fairly authentic and the characters similar to those same ones at my AIT in 1974. This movie rates high.,1
"Davis, unfortunately, is not that good. It's well worth catching on video or DVD. It only played week in Boston!",1

I do have a lot of those. - and I cannot stop here yet. Though I still mean it. I can't wait for the full film. Bravo.,1
"Unfortunately not much else lies below it. Take it for what it is, and don't expect a deep story. This film is worth watching at least few times.",1
< br / > < br / > Still the film is well done. I remember watching this film on Saturday afternoon TV in the 1950s or 60s. The American knock - off was a little flat.

Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. !,1

"Okay, I'll admit it - - I am a goof - ball and I occasionally love a really silly comedy. They all lack snob appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike them. And, by way, this reaper is about as different from Bergman's in THE SEVENTH SEAL as you can get! ! Great viewing for kids and adults alike.",1
"These songs teach the world to love again and war, hunger, evil are vanquished for eternity. It is their job to Kill the good Biff and Fred and take over their lives by making terrible music that no - one could like.",1
"Visual creative epic of inimitable style. Its friendly - naive and utopian. This film doesn't reflect reality. Yes way! Especially in this point Bogus Journey tops its prequel by far. But who dares to say this film is no art? < br / > < br / > Bogus Journey, for sure, is not one of this films.",1
"Go ahead ; I'll wait. If you're one of those who look at'Bogus'as if it were an outdated ( "" Fa gs! "" Well, then you've probably noticed the same trend that I have.

They are one of a kind. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is marvelously directed. It wasn't long before work began on sequel.,1
"Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, bring out a 3rd film! This is so much better then the first one, which was great as well. ! I recommend anyone to see this classic. Though the acting and scenery etc is poor, who cares. Possibly the funniest movie of all time!!!!!",1
"Watch for the games sequences, the best moment in the entire film, but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre. < br / > < br / > This gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature. < br / > < br / > In a great comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel.",1

Probably since this dared to be different is why it took 12 producers to pull it off. It even boils down to 7 games against death - - Battleship and Club.",1
The funny thing was that they played him stupid little games like clue.,1

"Go and get it, folks!",1
This movie is gorgeous.,1
And it IS hillarious. How often do you experience that with modern hollywood productions?,1
"Needless to say, the film - makers deserved more acclaim than they were accorded. Such an omission beggars belief, since Spielberg's direction here is top - notch.",1
"They felt totally improvisatory, absolutely without affectation. Do not miss it. I urge people to look it up watch it.",1
"What we see here seems, at times, to be heart breakingly real. < br / > < br / > Jim McKay's writing / direction is graceful and uncluttered. < br / > < br / > Our Song is a film not to be missed - by anyone of any age. < br / > < br / > Much of the credit for the film's spirit goes to its principle actors.",1
"< br / > < br / > The naturalism is whole, complete. The film breathes, stays in the moment, inhabits real time. Some scenes standout, such as the girls lolling about, each revealing her deepest fantasies. Details emerge of their own, are never pushed, and thus seem all the more real and powerful for their understatement. The story tells itself. The language is rich, spontaneous, the acting transparent. Her sharing with her mother her confusion and fear before the stark challenges of adult life is equally moving, and beautifully, unsentimentally affirmative.",1
"The vivid sound recording by Jan McLaughlin deserves to be especially noted. A lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of school. This ain't no music video shorthand telling of teenage life. It is / was always thus. Lanisha hangs with her dad at his security job - it's the only way she gets to spend time with him. It's a gesture but by the end of the film, we know it to be a genuine one. Small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout. The opening title slide ` A film by'seems to list everyone in the universe. Welcome heat and idleness.",1
"Hence, distribution questions - - how do we get our hands on it? After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy.",1
The hand - held camera is never distracting and always where it should be. I can't wait to see what Mr. McKay does next. Not one. There is not one false note in the entire film.,1

"While the performances have some amateurish moments, I became so involved with the story that I forgot the girls were even acting. Joycelyn works in an up - scale dress shop but dreams about becoming a singer. Maria, whose father is in jail, has learned that she is pregnant by Terrell, a local student.

The world Not so much because of its looks but because of the inventiveness of it. This movie would have been better off without both. In some cases up and down no longer apply but our heroes still manage to get a foothold somewhere. The creation of the world is another masterpiece.,1
His look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof - ball.,1
The end. The voices and the sounds are top notch. < br / > < br / > The animation is great. No depth to this world ( pun intended ).,1
Its all really well done. This is a CGI animated film based upon a French 2D animated series. < br / > < br / > Is it perfect?,1

"Some of the backdrops are just drop - dead gorgeous and you can see the French talent behind it. Of course, it has its flaws but I can still really recommend it. Hektor alone is worth watching the movie since some of his moments are Stitch - like hilarious.",1
A bit Tim Burton - ish if you like.,1
I was amazed. The animation is stunning.,1
"It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Much like the Pixar movies, it's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today's world. The monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action. Of course, Hector is the character most will fall in love with. Oh, you have? Did water flow upwards and remnants of great cities levitate on the horizon?",1
"Watching Goldberg play Celie, it's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like "" Sister Act "".",1

Jeon's face is very changeable. Is life really harsher here, away from the big city and its sophistication?",1
"That doesn't mean that it lacks unity : on the contrary, it's rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in pain. In a Coreen drama such as this "" Secret Sunshine "", you'll also find some comical parts, thriller scenes and romantic times. """,1
"Having read that she won Best Actress award at Cannes in 2007, I expected her to a decent job. Shin - ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can.",1
It is a movie that might push someone over the edge... which hardly sounds like a recommendation. It is a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering.,1
"What follows is a journey through one woman's tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms. Secret Sunshine marks the return of director Lee Changdong to the film - making world after a multi - year absence. But this isn't a romantic comedy. She moves to Milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was his hometown, so the film is born from tragedy.",1
"However, the acting of Jeon Do - Yeon is incredibly beautiful. But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another.",1
"But, this is not Hollywood. Life is what happens to you. Do.",1
"Without love, we can't talk about hope and salvation. "" She says, "" How could You forgive the man before I forgive? "" This sparks anger in her toward God. This film also talked about the forgiveness of God and people. Her lie causes much sorrow. Do you have to go to the prison? """,1
"Lee Chang - dong's exceptional "" Secret Sunshine "" is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year. She becomes the centre of the film's universe as well as ours.",1
I'd already missed 15 minutes when I woke up to it on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I saw this film in the worst possible circumstance.,1
"However, given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie, I think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called It is thus at the same time, instructive to note the reviewer reaction to the movie. The movie in a word is superlative. It does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written. Ultimately, it is a matter of faith. I do agree with the reviewer in that, the Evangelical stuff was a bit too much.",1
"< br / > < br / > Highly recommend. She trusts in God, only to find that God seems to forgive everyone, even the killer.",1
"I tend to watch Korean movies just for that reason alone. This film doesn't answer that, rightly so. They need to show life as it is. It ' I've always been waiting for a Christian film that truly portrays the darker recesses of church life. She doesn't deny God exists. Real people curse, real people lust, real people fall.",1

"But I knew of Hopalong from the novels first, and never cared much for the Boyd films once I got around to them.",1
No character should be so tied to an an actor that no one else ever be allowed to play him or her again! The fact that we're watching a story within a story makes the oddness and exaggerations more palatable.,1
"Man, relax and enjoy. It was a fun, tongue in cheek, look at old Western '.",1
A great film! ).,1
Nuit Noire contains almost no plot. Search that DVD and you'll be rewarded! That's a drawback.,1
Extremely interesting and intriguing movie.,1
"The desert sun heats these ingredients up to a hard boil, with face - slappingsplenty and empurpled exchanges. Even more blatant are John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his insanely jealous torpedo. Both Lancaster and ( surprisingly ) Hodiak fall for Scott.",1
THE FOURTH MAN ( Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983 ).,1
"< br / > < br / > 6. Jereone Krabbe was amazing as the "" tortured artist "", and supporters were very good as well. What really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting.",1
"You don't want to miss it! "" This is truly a film to cry and die for...! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey ( oh lord!",1
My Mom does not like him so much but I disagree. Paul Verhoeven is one of greatest directors. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways.,1
"The woman is Christine ( Soutendijk ), and Verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she's up to. Will Garard be the 4th man she kills? As the character himself states at one point, he is a professional liar, unable to recall the truth. She's also got < br / > < br / > secrets, like three dead husbands. There's a lot of very strong gay content, which may make some viewers squirm. Verhoeven offers up < br / > < br / > Gerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man.",1
"Get a grip! On a serious note it was entertaining to see some of Jan de Bont's camera work and one of Paul Verhoeven's earlier films. So very European, so very Dutch!",1
"Just watch his Dutch films. 'De Vierde Man'brought him one step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best. Not only do they show that he needs certain amount of freedom, but they also show that he has remarkable talent. He needs that.",1
"Verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film, playing with the meaning of the hero's visions - omen.",1
< br / > < br / > i would like thanks Mr. Verhoeven to make such a black comedy. < br / > < br / > that's it. so it is obviously for me to watch this another Verhoeven movie. Reve do sex with her at her house as she is a boy. it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much.,1
And a guy being run over by a speedboat * zoom * bloody corpse going down. A guy being eaten by a Lion * chomp * teeth in the throat. And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.,1
"The fun is in figuring it out. On a trip to Flushing he is'seduced'by Christine. After all, enforced heterosexuality has its compensations.",1
"Dutch locations into suspenseful film - noir setting, impressive work! This last Dutch speaking film of Verhooven made me laugh good.",1
"Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, the fiery woman tamed by fate. < br / > < br / > In the role of the abused and awakened Celie, Whoopi Goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles.",1
"I saw it in 1983 and it is a film that "" stuck. "" 'Is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess? It's a nice change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare.",1
< br / > < br / > From the beginning of The Fourth Man it's clear that the film will be seen from the perspective of the famous albeit impoverished author Gerard. In an erotic fantasy sequence that would make Luis Buñuel blush he substitutes a man he's Unlike that film The Fourth Man is also perversely funny as Gerard's deeply held Catholic beliefs seep into every aspect of his life including sexuality. 1983's The Fourth Man was the last film he made before moving to the U. S. and it seems to have been a transitional film for him.,1
"So go figure. In a lot of user - comments on this site I noticed the mentioning of Alfred Hitchcock. Now, has anybody stopped and thought about fact that the word "" rêve "" is French for "" dream ""? Could this be coincidence...? Proves again what an excellent actress she is.",1
"If you like the work of Ken Russell and David Lynch, I can almost guarantee you will love this movie. It mixes abstract / surreal / parallel fantasy - reality scenes and somehow makes it all work. What surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess. There is NOT an out - of - left - field resolution here. Hell, if you have no idea who they even are, you still might like it.",1
"It can't get much better than this, a true classic erotic nightmare cinema. 10 out of 10, at least... De Vierde Man "" makes even "" Basic Instinct "" look quite tame...",1
"< br / > < br / > The ambiguous "" The Vierde Man "" is another magnificent feature of Paul Verhoeven in his Dutch phase. My vote is eight. Last but not the least ; the androgynous beauty of the sexy Renée Soutendijk perfectly fits to her role of a woman that attracts a gay writer. While in the railway station in Amsterdam, he feels a non - corresponded attraction to a handsome man that embarks in another train. Christine travels to Köln to bring her boyfriend and Gerard stays alone in her house.",1
"If you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on TV, video or DVD, don't miss it!",1
Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine ). Jeroen Krabbé holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. Paul Verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit'Basic Instinct'is a stylish and shocking neo - noir thriller.,1
"Fascinating Hitchcockian thriller, very original and provocative. Highly Reommended! Great cinematography by future director Jan de Bont.",1
It really was a pleasant surprise. I even like the spider metaphor. This is by far Verhoeven's best film ( maybe second only to Robocop ). Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man ( The Fourth Man ) is one of the most compelling thrillers I have ever seen.,1
"It is quite an entrance. This is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations. The film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with "" Mister "". It is first in a line of films people either didn't see or wouldn't see because there are no aliens.",1
"He was right! Why was it X rated? Still, it's a great film. Paul Verhoeven made this after "" Spetters "". "" Then things get strange.",1
2 WORDS : Academy Award. This film had everything in it. ! Nuff said.,1
The plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story. All of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed. < br / > < br / > I highly recommend this movie.,1
And his girl - sidekick Frankie is quite a dish.,1
"Nevertheless, a few of the later shows were a match for any, due to the guest stars. Each worked well with Davis. Ace action directer William Witney directed 30 episodes. Franklin Adreon the rest. Both filmed the action with polish. Each episode was built around a real historical figure of the old west.",1
One other note.,1
The Lone Ranger could only wish for lady companionship. But the studios'tenure as producer of TV pulp fiction would be brief.,1
A masterpiece.,1
"I have seen the movie at the Viennale a few years ago, where the audiences liked it. So her transformation at the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise. It´s Phoenix credit that we don´t loose the interest in the movie after the first hour.",1
"To make it worse, this movie is very badly cast.",1
"But, believe it or not, this film is much "" less "" conventional. This is a powerful, incredibly provocative film.",1
"Sitting in balcony, front row, leaning over the rail, there is a vast space between her mind and the stage, a space that enables her to breathe, think, feel, and yearn. < br / > < br / > Her only form of mental escape is the Yiddish theatre.",1

"This movie is light, funny, and beautifully filmed. < br / > < br / > Every character is touching, and interpretation is close to perfection.",1
archambault. And I absolutely adore Isabelle Blais!!!,1
"< br / > < br / > Hell, I was right. Should we ask more for first movie?",1
"Sonja Richter's performance is alone worth price of admission. < br / > < br / > Writer / director / actor Eric Clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty a ponderous businessman son ( Jorgen, played by Clausen ) has loving a father who has never accepted him. Highly recommended.",1
International viewers unaware of his Big Brother participation will find him a fair actor.,1
"Anna ( Richter ), an ambitious young actress, has lost a deeply coveted role in Moliere play and, reduced to making an utterly stupid TV chicken commercial, is on the verge of suicide. For the record, "" Villa Paranoia "" is a fiction film, written, directed and acted in by Mr. Clausen, and employing certain motifs from Moliere's "" The Imaginary Invalid "". Five prizes in a single weekend - - not a bad scoop for a film from a small country with unknown actors.",1
You believe that he really is sick. The 4 primary actors were fantastic.,1
The special effects were INCREDIBLE! Zhang Ziyi did nothing for me in this movie. This movie is good. Theres too much story to cram in 2 hours.,1
"Bitterly. < br / > < br / > I'd have to say it's one of best movies I've seen this year and I'm greatly anticipating his next. Well, for starters, this actually was THE most elegant Clausen film to this date. Not only the ethnic but also the normal people you tend to forget. And on top of that, he himself manages to play a b * * * * * * d!",1
There's not a lot of plot here. The scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular.,1
This man is brilliant.,1
If you like to laugh you HAVE to see special! I sure am glad that I have now!,1
"and "" Do you have a Flag? "" There is a wide range of subjects in this stand - up and they are simply hysterical. < br / > < br / > Thanks Andrew and Catherine!...",1
I could listen all day. His unique approach to life is quite logical.,1
We need more of his shows available.,1
EVER.,1
"Forever more, "" Do you have a flag? "" With so many memorable laughs, one can't help but repeat some of his lines. Every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see "" Dress to Kill "".",1
"I'm one of the guys who didn't understand the story at all, but this was still a great flick to watch. ... and I love it. Which is saying a lot for a movie again, made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits. The topic is exotic and original.",1
"I was dead at the time! "" Skip over those if you can. I HIGHLY recommend this one.",1
He can really say a lot with his eyes. One of the best comedians ever.,1
"He simply shines. Right, then, he's absolutely brilliant. But you must be intelligent and quick to understand his humor.",1
I laughed so hard I left a puddle. I really hope to see a lot more from this wonderful guy. What more could anyone want? Thanks for your time.,1
I have not done so ever since.,1
No way. He's not a frenetic fantasist like Robin Williams. Many of Izzard's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances. He's not a joke maker.,1
"I tried not to laugh too loudly at the first few jokes. Someone by the name of "" Eddie Izzard "" was on. It's convulsively funny.",1
"The God of Biscuits! """,1
9 out of 10.,1
But that makes it only better! And that makes it so great! Straight said : you haven't seen a story alike yet in a modern movie!,1
One of the very best Three Stooges shorts ever. Highly recommended.,1
"Thumbs way up. I laughed so hard, I'm sure I missed half the jokes.",1
This video rocked!,1
"My jaws were aching from laughter by the end of show. Well, he blew us away. He's better than Robin Williams ever was. 'is priceless. I'd heard of Eddie Izzard, but had never seen him in action.",1
It is worth it! This is truly feel good show.,1
witty.,1
"Watch, enjoy, it's funny.",1
"And I do like it. For me "" The legend of Zu "" is perfectly transparent. It is a really beautiful film! I am not a Buddhist. it is entirely symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning.",1
See it. You won't regret. His show stayed with me afterwards.,1
The fine line between life and art is dazzling.,1
The plot is also gripping and mysterious.,1
I've seen this film at least 4 times since'84 and it's still great every time I see it.,1
"I have seen it many, many times since. This continues up to the climax of film.",1
"She could not tolerate the possessive love of any man and would prefer death to submission. Highly recommended. Saura / Gades'film is unique as the most sensual of all and truly Spanish. It is set on the immortal Bizet's music. Passionate, dramatic, riveting as Flamenco itself, the film is simply amazing.",1
"Antonio falls in love for Carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love. My vote is seven. < br / > < br / > "" Carmen "" is another great movie of Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to the Flamenco dance.",1
"A true classic! Somehow it is missing in this movie. The plot is a bit hard to follow. Now we know, he made this movie.",1
There is passion. The direction wonderful. < br / > < br / > There is tragedy. < br / > < br / > There is... < br > < br / > Carmen.,1
"One really needs to see Blood Wedding next to Carmen to appreciate the comparison. It remains a gadget, and, for that reason, a bothersome distraction.",1
The magic is continuing.,1
Spellbinding is the only word I can use to describe the experience. This is not a usual film by any standard.,1
"It's a sentimental film, reasonably well made but hardly breathtaking.",1
"< br / > < br / > It was far not for the first time life of one of the most legendary American presidents was brought to the screen. Curiously enough both of them were based on a very successful Broadway Stage Play released in 1938 and written by Robert Sherwood. Right in the beginning of the 1930s Griffith did it in his Abraham Lincoln and the same year as Ford's film, MGM released John Cromwell's one called Abe Lincoln in Illinois.",1
"OK, first a correction to the tag posted on this movie's main page.",1
How am I supposed to take this seriously. But the story was just so weak. Cousin Vinnie? I mean come on! I mean who the hell was he supposed to be?,1
"My what a director's intuition can bring on material that needs just the right nudge in the right directions. But as the lawyer in his earlier years he was charismatic, funny in the most unexpected places, and a true gentleman. Fonda's own personality, in a sense, as it would in Grapes of Wrath and My Darling Clementine, comes out in the character of Lincoln.",1
"The Legend of Zu, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I'd watch it again. They were expecting something akin to Star Wars, and it was not that. Joseph Campbell, I believe, would have liked this film. We all have a mountain of swords within us. There were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked.",1
"It's remarkable that for'Young Mr. Lincoln's'supporting players Ford cast lesser known, other - than - star actors.",1
He has also appeared in 11 Best Picture Nominees. < br / > < br / > In the role of Abraham Lincoln we have Henry Fonda who effectively displays a quiet strength. The obvious intent was to portray Lincoln as young man developing the attributes that would make him the great man he would become.,1
"In Mohawk, pioneer America is in full bloom with Americans fending for themselves against Indians and other forces. I believe this is simply a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, widely regarded as the greatest American president. Indeed, our government surely needs more men like him. In the same tune as his Americana Drums Along the Mohawk, John Ford captures American history in a way that is fictional yet very believable. We even get some scenes between him and a young Mary Todd ; and it is hard to see how they did end up together but that is not point. His quiet and straightforward demeanor was rare then and would be today.",1
"The other performances are solid though, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused. She's a nice lady who we can really feel for. I wanted more story and character development. Never mind though. I just don't believe that real Lincoln was that soft - spoken. < br / > < br / > It's a nice watch, but not a classic. The film is 100 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it. < br / > < br / > John Ford seems to think of this film as an epic, and at the time of its release, it probably was.",1
It is perhaps the actors best performance.,1
However! The basic hook here is : Lincoln Is Slow.,1
"He studied laws, common law and began practice as lawyer in 1837.",1
The supporting cast includes many of Ford's regulars.,1
It is a fooler. He goes forward into history. Definitely worth seeing again.,1
"The film sings of the life of a hopeful young man. < br / > < br / > The film concerns two young men, brothers, on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed. Ford's camera has only praising views to reveal of Mr. Lincoln's early life. But for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision.",1
< br / > < br / > The film marked Ford's first of nine collaborations with Henry Fonda and is also a quintessential example of Ford's folksy Americana vein.,1
Massey still remains the definitive Lincoln. It's almost like you're watching a newsreel. I'll say no more. < br / > < br / > This is not a biographical film of Lincoln.,1
"Humbled, Fonda took the role. < br / > < br / > Fonda did NOT want to play Lincoln ; he felt he couldn't do justice to the'Great Emancipator ', and feared a bad performance would damage his career. Carl Sandburg's continuation of his epic biography, "" Abraham Lincoln : The War Years "", was published, and quickly became a best seller. Even a filmed make - up test, in which he was stunned by how much he would resemble Lincoln, wouldn't change his mind. ( John Ford offered a different scenario of the events, but the outcome was the same! )",1
Young Mr. Lincoln is pre - Civil War America. Ford is creating a sort of mythic history of America on screen. This amazingly wrongheaded analysis simply proves that great historians are rarely fine film critics.,1
"This little film had long been on my "" keeper "" list. Think about that!",1
). I found it highly enjoyable look at history. This film is more documentary than for the sake of acting.,1
"It is worth watching. Overall, what's not to like? Besides, name another film in which Whitman is brought so vividly to life?",1
: ),1
"So, finally I know it exists.",1
"It's a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film. Someone ought to make this available for home video! ), Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful young mute woman.",1
Not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline. The fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way. In due respect.,1
Email me for a chance to see it..... its fabulous to see it again.,1
One by one they give their true identities.,1
No one I know saw film and I had almost given up on ever finding it's title.,1
"I saw this movie on TV when it came out, and never seen it again.",1
As far as I know its only ever been shown once in the UK and sadly is unavailable on DVD or VHS. < br / > < br / > If anyone can trace a copy please let me know.,1
< br / > < br / > * * * * out 4 stars. They do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't match. The stooges are always funny when they cook.,1
This is a very hilarious short. Green and McIntyre provide great performances here!,1
"Budget considerations, coupled with fewer bookings for two - reel comedies, influenced the decision to use older footage. Moe and Larry are newly henpecked husbands, having married Shemp's demanding sisters. < br / > < br / > 7 out of 10. At his music studio, Shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself! The remake contains most of the footage from that film.",1
).,1
The special effects are beautiful and imaginative.,1
"Almost no USD at all. This is not a "" B "" or "" C "" movie.",1
But besides this? Instant classic of course. Thousands of Russians dying. This is film history. Insert into video and laugh.,1
"Marvelous James Stewart, Vera Miles vehicle. < br / > < br / > The film has nothing but praise for J. Edgar Hoover. He certainly brought the FBI up to par.",1
"Overall, it goes on way too long.",1
Its drama and action - packed episodes were thrilling. The Hardesty character was well drawn and admirable.,1
"Enjoy the story, but with tongue firmly in cheek.",1
"< br / > < br / > Of special interest to older viewers familiar with Washington, DC.",1
"Instead, it's a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose. But, as entertainment goes, it does a good job. This isn't among Jimmy Stewart's best films - - I'm quick to admit that.",1
"I first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on DVD. Through it all, the family carries on with bravery and dignity.",1
I watched this movie on a video that I had taped off of the television.,1
"< br / > < br But I can see this film as one you either love or you hate. Meanwhile White Eyebrows and Red try, with the help of King Sky, to stop Insomnia. But that was because this isn't really a remake. Nothing appears rushed - unlike Hero.",1
The background score is also pleasant. I have read recent online articles suggesting that this is a forgotten film. But Jimmy is the movie. Vera Miles as his devoted wife is also good.,1
"Vera Miles gives a spotty performance, but it's very convincing, none the less. Well maybe that's just me? Well, just remember before you decide to break the law, the FBI will always be there. The film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the FBI handles and how they handle them. He even helped bring Communist spies to justice. Every scene was so fluid they just Perhaps the greatest part of this movie was Mervyn Leroy's fabulous direction. Almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job.",1
It's important sometimes to remember there WAS an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover headed it. Stewart and Miles are most assuredly an all American couple. Burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the Harding administration. Some of that time is covered in the film as well. In addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the FBI's story itself. It was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film.,1
What is significant is what it leaves out. This is no doubt why Purvis was never mentioned in the film. The FBI accomplishments that the film highlights are undoubtedly all true. Never mind the Mafia. < br / > < br / > The film is probably accurate in its portrayal of FBI activity up through the end of WWII. Were they also completely ignored and replaced by the fictional Hardesty.,1
"The Drug Years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini - series or other kinds of TV documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on TV. < br / > < br / > Is it with the great interest and depth of a Ken Burns documentary? It's actually not long enough, in a way. The only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not'just say no ', because as war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought.",1
You should definitely see it!!! I am waiting for DVD release.,1
"I loved it, all segments from 60's - present day.",1
"This guy knows his stuff! ! I found him to be an excellent spokesperson for this documentary. The soundtrack was excellent. I particularly enjoyed watching the film clips from the hippie era, and the 70's stoner culture.",1
I appreciate any comments on this from those who enjoyed it ( or didn't ) and would love to hear from fans! I know that he loves what he does and he does it well. ! Three cheers for uncle Martin!,1
"< br / > < br / > I appreciated this nicetylish picture. Great cast with just fine acting. It's truly a fun movie to watch, but is it too weird? Kept me glued through the entire picture. < br / > < br / > The new Legend of Zu has truly improved from the one in 1983. This is really worth checking out.",1
"Vh1 has fashioned a complete intricate portrayal of the life and times during the "" Drug Years "". I've been watching this every night on VH1 this past week. Featuring tons of fascinating interviews and news reel footage.",1
When he goes to Warner Bros.,1
"< br / > < br / > Both of them. Maybe sounding like a real movie star would help. The poor guy is so nervous about his big moment, he starts thinking of ways to deliver his one line. Like Thank Your Lucky Stars a few Warner Brothers contract players with a free moment strolled through this film.",1
"< br / > < br / > Ace comic O'Hanlon has a dual role, playing both McDoakes and himself playing McDoakes! ), Jack Mower.",1
"In fact, Helen asks her permission to hit her. Very good!",1
Even more startling are the drawings she's made that ( SPOILER! ) Shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up? Watched this as a late TV movie last night purely by chance. < br / > < br / > The ending is weak.,1
Thank you.,1
"Anyone in between, give it a miss, or be prepared to squirm. ! And be warned : as tough as the movie is from beginning to near - end, the worst is to come. The mother agrees to this, they both stand up, and - instead of a well primed slap - the daughter clenches her fist and delivers a boxer's blow. Even the technical qualities - lighting, editing, etc.",1
"Will play best with more mature audiences, possibly women, who may better empathize with the central character, her needs and issues.",1
"The warmth that should be there is missing. What does really say? She clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one, but she had a purpose. Paula is a bit ( well, more than a bit ) neurotic. He dies that night. < br / > < br / > May, now a widow, is lost. While Paula is working during the day, May begins to have conversations and lunches with Darren.",1
"I mean, nobody's surprised when Sean Connery has a love affair in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones... but what would you think if it was otherwise? But she's not in the mood for "" resting "", not yet. It doesn't look that we've advanced that such in those aspects. An old woman, a young guy... nah, you ain't ready for that, are you?",1
"Instead of treating him like a friend, she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple. At the same time, May was coping with life after death of Toots. < br / > < br / > Darren was nice and friendly to May, and May soon finds some affection on Darren. And this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family. < br / > < br / > However, The Mother tells a different story.",1
"Paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser, who accepts her life the way it is. She confesses that she did not love her son and her daughter. Darren is an amoral addicted jerk who does not like anybody, even himself. She cheated her husband twice with an intellectual.",1
Recent adapted travesty's like'Intimacy'have ruined great writing.,1
"She bares more than her soul for the screen. The central family is anything but warm, supportive, and understanding of her new and tragic stage in life with the death of her husband. While good with his hands at building a conservatory, he is unable to construct meaning in his life. < br / > < br / > One of < br / > < br / > Daniel Craig is the enabling handyman, Derrek who beds both mother and daughter.",1
"Well, i just love him. When May says ""... this lump of a body... "" wow. What a neat role.",1
"A must see for serious film lovers. The writing is crisp, realistic, nuanced, and even restrained.",1
I saw it this evening on DVD. It drew me in relentlessly.,1
Well worth search!!! This movie is very cool.,1
"And the goon may look scary, but he's somehow funny. It won't disappoint.",1
"< br / > < br / > This film was a grand experiment that said : "" Hey! """,1
!,1
"May's teacher daughter Paula ( Cathryn Bradshaw ) lives nearby, however, and the relationship between May and Paula initially appears closer.",1
"In Anne Reid, Mr. Michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of May. Also amazing is Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will react to the situation. May responds by transforming herself in front of our eyes. < br / > < br / > Darren awakes in May a passion she has not ever known. Obviously her sexual life was next to nothing.",1
< br / > < br / > A truly brilliant performance and an enjoyable film. The twisted part?,1
Powerful cast. Great script.,1
< br / > < br / > I highly recommend this movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her turn as May. Reid's eyes and face reveal all of May's anguish and despair. His story's not easy to take. Nevertheless, it's powerfully good stuff. Or, when she begs Paula to open the front door after a disastrous date.",1
"And it is beautifully acted. It's about intelligent people whose lives don't add up to much. The director, Roger Michell, allows scenes to build instinctively.",1
"The slippers business was a bit OTT too, on reflection ). Almost Mike Leigh in that respect ( minus the contrived catharses that the latter inexplicably goes in for ). She's / not / "" the repressed, dutiful housewife discovering herself for the first time "", this is far too simplistic for the character we have. Here was a script that let the actors breathe and do something interesting with fairly minor parts. < br / > < br / > And of course I was, as everyone probably was, dumbfounded by what Anne Reid does with her character and with her body.",1
"She's attractive, not pretty, and she seems to have a close relationship with mum - at first. Kids - of whatever age - don't want to know about their parents'sex lives. Rejecting typical widowhood with its legacy of boring days and no adventure, she goes to stay with Paula who has a young son. widow. Paula ( Cathryn Bradshaw ), is a teacher with aspirations of succeeding as a writer.",1
VITAL severe MASTERPIECE!,1
"< br / > < br / > Superman was presented as believable, strong, and iconic. It deserves to be. The Daily Planet characters Lois, Jimmy, and Perry were portrayed well.",1
"Fantastic on the 90's Fantastic Four, I could still see this version of Superman in my mind. Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor, who on the SuperFriends was formerly Firestorm. LOL! What a rhyme. < br / > < br / > A new animated show of Superman was something I was not going to pass up. I loved this show. Ginny McSwain as Lois Lane.",1
Here she's absolutely perfect as cold - hearted user ( and abuser ) of weak men.,1
"As Johnny, Mark Damon is a reasonably suitable stand in but without the seething exterior. < br / > < br / > Care for some more story exaggerations? As for that saloon fight, I got a kick out of the kung fu sound effects every time a punch connected.",1
"It more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants. She is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty. Very tight western with few main characters and still absorbing. Among them a couple, where the wife is especially wicked.",1
"< br / > < br / > Given these criteria, Johnny Yuma succeeds. The quality of the execution is also, obviously, important. < br / > < br / > Johnny Yuma is, in most respects, not terribly original, but this actually does not count against it.",1
Her performance is very believable. Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? Her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. This is a very memorable spaghetti western.,1
Convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started. Willie and Irene are on the skids and Harry gradually falls in love with Irene and they plan to leave New York as soon as Harry finishes his novel.,1
"But you know what? I'm sure a lot of writers are like that. My only mild criticism of the film would be its ending. But the point is Snoop did a "" good "" job.",1
I thought it kicked a * s! ! It was so creative and unique.,1
she is from a punjabi family livin in a small town. this movie is truly a very good movie. one true great performance. she is like u have never seen before.,1
The end is very interesting.,1
The characters come to life. The treatment of the subject is very delicate.,1
"This is a extremely well - made film. But it is never painted as a black - and - white case. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends. In that sense, it is similar to "" Mr & Mrs Iyer "".",1
One of the better movies about the partition that I have seen. I was very fond of this film. It kept me guessing till just before the very end what would happen.,1
Because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families India. Superb. This movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way. will not be able to ask them to return the houses.,1
"All were perfectly cast. Here, no one country is depicted as good or bad. It is without a doubt the best Hindi movie I have seen to date.",1
< br / > < br / > I simply loved. Urmila and manoj bajpai have given their best.,1
"Better that the audience has to fill in some of what came before than to leave out any of what remains. So I don't have a broad basis for comparing Pinjar to other Indian films. Luckily, no comparison is needed. I'm relatively new to Bollywood films and was born and raised in the US.",1
The climax is just killer. < br / > < br / > Urmila did the role of her life in this movie. The movie kept haunting me for many days. Not to be missed. Priyanshu Chattarjee did good work as Triloki.,1
Thank that to Tsui Hark's extensive use of CGI effects.,1
This movie was absolutely wonderful.,1
"But this movie changed everything. It helped me to understand my own family history, which was always something very abstract to me. Two thumbs up!",1
The film at points is deeply traumatic.,1
Many of the reviewers have made it a point to note that Pinjar is unlike the run of the mill films produced in Bollywood.,1
"< br / > < br / > A must - see film. < br / > < br / > The film rests on the great acting of Urmilla Matondkar, and also some from Manoj Bajpai.",1
All were perfectly cast. I was so totally wrong. In a word... amazing. I was haunted by it after watching it. This movie gives it all. I recommend it with all my heart.,1
< br / > < br / > Why see this film? You'll see why.,1
< br / > < br / > But what drags down the film is that elements involving the characters aren't explained to the degree one might wish more. Though in Tepper there is a tendency to downplay his emotions.,1
"Believe me, it was like that. Go ahead, name another movie that even approaches this one : "" Getting Straight ""? "" ). RPM ""? Why isn't this film available from imdb?",1
"Yes, the cast and crew is basically the same. In small, cramped spaces. You should too! For Alive, almost everything takes place inside.",1
Good work. Without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end.,1
"It's like watching a lab experiment. It certainly kept me awake that night. An inventive, suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia.",1
Tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death.,1
"B. and would you kill him to obtain freedom? < br / > < br / > The first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest, it sneaks up without you actually knowing it. Sounds a little suspicious, but the two men accept : What else can they do? Our hero says yes to option 2, and then the actual story commences. AHA!",1
< br / > < br / > Rent this! This film is brutal when it needs to be so faint of heart need not apply. Personally I think it is well done and worth it.,1
< br / > < br / > Excellent film. I found this movie to be very well - paced.,1
"It reminded me of Zelda ( Ocarina of Time ) when you face level bosses. During the film, i noticed about 10 people get up and walk out.",1
"One always suspected that Rohmer was a conservative, but who knew he was such a red - blooded reactionary. It is a blatantly artificial conceit, but it somehow works. And newcomer Lucy Russell succeeds making sympathetic a character that shouldn't be.",1
< br / > < br / > * My rate : 7.,1
"The look of "" L'Anglaise "" is like something you've never seen before. < br / > < br / > Now for technological nuts and bolts.",1
"Why? Shakespeare was talky, too. They prefer action. Do yourself a favor and see this riveting film. These are what this film is all about. It may be the last film by this screen Master.",1
"Her French seems to be excellent, as it appears she is fluent in it. The setting is Paris during the days that followed the French Revolution. The supporting cast also was great. could have used a better translation for the title. """,1
This is quite an amazing film to watch. No accounting for taste ). The filming of Louis's death is masterly. Grace cannot bear to watch her king be killed. Her view is that of an aristocrat.,1
If it has a theme at all it's anti - warfare.,1
"However the new version, featuring Van Der Beek et al, is more comic. The first time I ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad. My dad actually recorded it off the TV.",1
"However, there is a couple of caveats to this statement. The Original music score is also far better than the Disney remix. It begs the question why did Disney make such changes?",1
"< br / > < br / > Recommended. Saw this on SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where it was titled "" Laputa : Castle in the sky "". The children are not the only ones looking for this island.",1
The other voices are bad. Now I am on a search to see every film by Miyazaki. Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola. The voice acting is varied. James Van Der Beek fares best.,1
"Initially a box office disappointment in its 1986 release, it has since been embraced by critics and audiences around the world. Dola, in particular, makes for a terrific comic character, shouting orders to her dimwitted sons one moment and being protective of Sheeta the next.",1
"It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag. Here there are a whole bunch of them : the pirates. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it. Still. They provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I'm not sure. The animation, though still not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa. < br / > < br / > For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it.",1
MUST SEE FOR ALL AGES!,1
2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie. The collapsing scene gave me patches of Metropolis ending. It's just sad somehow. I'd give 9. The plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well ( as always ). Wondering if this will be the first Ghibi's dud.,1
It's not available on any distribution in an English - speaking country. Being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight. < br / > < br / > I just realised I've been using IMDb for years now and I've never reviewed my favourite film. The fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man. Go figure.,1
Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film.,1
"This film has everything. Then go see "" Laputa "".",1
The animation quality is excellent! I've seen the original English version on video. Disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising. ( but not quite! ),1
"To say much more would be to ruin the movie, so I'll kindly shut up. And that would be a crime. Suffice to say that I'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I couldn't go any higher for'Spirited Away'and'Princess Mononoke '. While'Castle in the Sky ', being a sci - fi adventure and very suitable for children, fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since, his motifs and principles still show and play an important part.",1
"a true fantasy adventure, a must see for all children and adults. breathtaking, this is without doubt the best anime cartoon ever made.",1
But not this one. Every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties.,1
there are always stories behind stories.,1
"It's obvious people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree. I know Anime.",1
But this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike.,1
"< br / > < br / > Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japnanese anime. The ending of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly same. Buy this movie and treasure it. Hayao Miyazaki name became prominent with Spitied Away, however what is often overlooked are director's first film efforts.",1
"< br / > < br / > This is exactly what Miyazaki's "" Castle in the Sky "" is all about. Simply put, it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another, and I can't help but feel my worries melt away every time I see it.",1
"< br / > < br / > The design work on Laputa, nearly twenty years later, is still revolutionary. To keep things lively, there's also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal, led by the aging but still boisterous Dola ( Cloris Leachman ). But I thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find.",1
"Enjoy, Piper A The plot is classic Miyazaki.",1
"It's obviously way past that year now, but the dub has been finally completed. Soon, the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid. Sheeta holds key to Laputa, the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization. Laputa : Castle in the Sky is a film for all ages and I urge everyone to see it. And believe me, it's one fantastic one. The storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted, you see Miyazaki's true vision.",1
You won't regret it. I found Vander - Geek to be just plain annoying. The only sour note is American Dubbing.,1
"< br / > < br / > Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney. I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it.",1
I give this movie one of my highest ratings. ! Go see it when it comes out in America!!,1
"< br / > < br / > Why is this film so good? This is one of the best animated family films of all time. Why? We never know. The animation is smooth, detailed, and cinematic ally composed - not a lot of flat shots. The backgrounds are wonderful. ( None of those trench - coat wearing posers ) There is plenty of adventure, but not blood and gore.",1
This movie totally impressed me! They were what made the movie for me.,1
Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi! Everything you ever possibly want from adventure movie is here. Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.,1
"Wow. It seems that there are legends in that area of a beast that was rather, uh, frisky, I guess you could say, with the ladies, or at least, one in particular. Anyway it seems that a young woman and her.. aunt?",1
"Needless to say, this movie fits into the aforementioned description to a "" T "". Many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film but perhaps due to me being desensitized, I am more disturbed by the subtleties.",1
Wow. I guess I'll start with the plot.,1
"I must say, I thought I had seen it all. < br / > < br / > For the first 40 minutes this movie is a TOTAL bore. Oh well. Then some nervous guy shaves. He did it. I am an extremely jaded movie buff. Ever. I would definitely recommend this film. I have to give the director credit.",1
Something you don't rarely see in films today. this one is out there.,1
I say that these reviewers have no imagination!,1
This movie is simply incredible! < br / > < br / > Go see it! It´s worth your money time!,1
"< br / > < br / > But then I thought, well WHY? < br / > < br / > The film was duly submitted and PASSED. Kinda "" adapt "" them, you know? I found it hilarious.",1
The plot is simple and the actors not extraordinary. Be satisfied.,1
"As bizarre as it is, "" La bête "" is doubtlessly also stunningly beautiful in style, settings and cinematography. The story soon descends into a bizarre sexual fever - dream... Borowczyk erotic fairy tale was banned in several countries for a long time, and it is quite obvious why this controversial gem fell victim to stuporous film censors. "" Due to an old curse, Mathurin's uncle ( Marcel Dalió ) is strictly against the wedding. Without giving away too much, I can say that fans of exceptional cinema should not consider missing this film.",1
The major catch is that the bridegroom is carrying an ancient curse on the family.,1
"I was 15. Oh, there is so much more! I can see why it was banned, not only for such explicit sex scenes, but for beastiality. I was clearly deceived after seeing... well... everything, to cut a long story short. It may be fun, but I doubt there are other porn films like this one.",1
"The images may look wild, perverse, "" sick "" or exciting, but they are all in relation with the lastly mentioned. Sex, desire and death are very strong and primary things and dominate all the flesh that has a human soul inside it. They interest and temptate us so powerfully ( and by our nature ) that they are considered scary, unacceptable and something too wild to be true.",1
"THE BEAST pops up, rapes the chick and shoots 400 gallons of spunk all over her. Eventually you see "" THE BEAST "", which looks like a guy dressed in a giant rat - bear costume with a horse cock attached to it. ! OK... this one's a weirdy.... The sheep ends up dead and the woman gets scared. The cinematography itself is quite eye - catching and the sets, costumes and locations are elaborate.",1
It transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art. Legend of Zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years.,1
Shemp was so good that I didn't mind he was taking the great Curly's place. Some detectives! That's last six minutes in here.,1
"Overall "" La Bête "" is a visual feast. Still this genuinely erotic film is wonderfully photographed and tasteless. A must - see for fans of European cult cinema.",1
"The film is very daring with it's subject material, and that is something to give it credit for. Both man and beast have instincts, only man knows how to control them. The theme of bestiality is a definite taboo, and for good reason, I might add ; but the film conveys it ; straight and to the point. < br / > < br / > The film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female. < br / > < br / > Many criticise the scenes around the film's shocking sex sequences for being boring, but these scenes are important to the film's story.",1
"With Ondrej, life will never be boring, but it sure won't be without a lot of headaches! The lead characters in this movie fall into two categories : smart and stupid. Simple enough. Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek's secrets safe.",1
"It is funny, dark and extremely enjoyable. < br / > < br / > I highly recommend this and most other projects Trojan and Machacek are involved in.",1
Cruel true reality.,1
Some scenes are truly worth seeing.,1
Everything is connected and has its why & because. You have to see it without knowing what is it about! I loved this movie!,1
"< br / > < br / > Be warned, this is not a movie that Kurosawa should be judged by.",1
5 hours with movie. Kurosawa is a proved humanitarian.,1
"Physically, several of actors are astonishingly beautiful. In another, a princess - warrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heat - seeking missile.",1
"This, and "" Hidden fortress "" are the Kurosawa's that are most dear to me. I don't hand out 10's like candy, but this certainly deserved it, if anything.",1
"I was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own. < br / > < br / > It's a great film, even if it is not greatest Kurosawa film.",1
It is a masterwork by a genius of cinema.,1
"The film is a visual work of art. As will all Kurasowa films there are always reasons to see his films, whether they work or not. It's a mix of laughter and sadness.",1
"I was not in the least disappointed, and I'd definitely recommend this. And he is just one of many odd characters in this surreal & at times, tragic tale of a group of slum - dwellers in Japan. 9 out 10.",1
"Is it any wonder that after making this film Kurasawa tried to kill himself?! It was not a fun experience. Not every episode is depressing and harsh, but overall this is definitely the tone. This is one of the weirder movies I have recently watched. No.",1
"However, DKD is also, unlike Dreams, a great film and probably my favorite Kurosawa picture. Mostly, I think, it's the colors. < br / > < br / > I will also argue, to the last, that this is Kurosawa's greatest achievement. Why?",1
"My vote is nine. "" It is inside a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo, where the dwellers are homeless drunkards, beggars, tramps, abused women, losers.",1
"That its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn't be ignored, but it's not at all a fault of Kurosawa's. There's things that happen to these people, and Kurosawa's challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole.",1
"A wonderful, draining experience.",1
"I've watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment. ). Oh man, why can't we have stuff like this coming out of Hollywood? This movie is well done on so many levels that I am in awe that the score is as low as it is ( 5. I'm begging you Mr. Hark - can we please have a sequel? < br / > < br / > This is not coming from a Asian film lover newbie either.",1
Maybe too much. This movie goes in many different directions and it's hard to settle down and get into it. The old man who is the center of the town who helps out a burglar that tries to rob him.,1
An emotionally moving beautiful film.,1
"( Maybe some one can fill us in on that one item, please! ) Fine, shapely Women Folk in some really keen 2 piece bathing suits ( Woo, woo, woo, woo! ) So, we got back to "" SEA HUNT "" and its own odyssey in ( 1955 ). We can't remember just how many weeks nor just how high it got. Let's look closely now.",1
Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series.,1
"He took to you a place not very accessible at that time, under the great blue sea. ! I loved it!",1
"I love Alton Brown as commentator, because he explains things with flair. I have watched the series and find all the players work together well. Perhaps that is all anyone can ask, to want to really eat what is served. The Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting. The judges are not always the best choices, however.",1
We all enjoy Elton Brown. We play along at home to guess who the winner will be.,1
< br / > < br / > The show is great. But... Meh. It's not going to be the Japanese version.,1
"And she falls for him. A comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little British effort "" The Divorce Of Lady X ( 1938 ) "". And he handles the screwball twists and turns, maybe not with ease, but with gusto. There is some nice battle - of - the - sexes dialogue, and fun exploration of sexual politics.",1
"Pretty special. Oberon gives her role the right light touch. Definitely worth seeing. With this cast, it's delightful. I mean, Richardson and Olivier?",1
I highly recommend it. Ralph Richardson was a delight to watch as well.,1
"But he has not reckoned with Merle Oberon as Leslie Steele. The other is this film, made in England a year earlier. One night he checks into a hotel just ahead of a crowd of people. But she kittenishly refuses to tell him her name. THE DIVORCE OF LADY X is a romantic comedy ( as WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a romantic tragedy ).",1
"It starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious. Florence who? As they all do in this gripping ensemble piece. Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie. Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine. Fans of 30's / 40's movies, Don't miss this one! It transports you into another world.",1
Who knows?,1
The story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments. Later comes a protracted battle with the Cheyenne.,1
Funniest series I have ever seen!!! One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams playing herself. !,1
"i don't care how you get it, rent it, order it, steal it, download it, just see this movie. < br / > < br / > simply the best movie ever.",1
"It's worth it. If you ever, EVER, have the chance to see this movie see it. And boy does it ever succeed. If you need chop off your arm to see it, see it. It takes trash cinema and elevates it to a work of art.",1
Highly highly recommended. It is the truth.,1
This is pure girl FUN with the most fantastic cast of female leads. This isn't Masterpiece Theater.,1
"Missi Pyle! ) and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. Rachel Dratch!, Sophie Monk!, Parker Posey! OMG!",1
Funny funny funny funny! Not me. The movie was a real surprise.,1
"), and Dracht has a gay fiancée ( Seth Meyers from SNL, funny ).",1
It has officially become my new favourite movie. I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy.,1
"None of today's movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years. < br / > < br / > We don't have any giants in Hollywood anymore. Filmmakers like today s Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox.",1
Please continue taking chances and accept my heartfelt gratitude. All the characters are well developed 3D especially Coop.,1
"Eileen Bruno doesn't appear to be happy being there. The real mystery is revealed by her. Sean and Jimmy were partners. The murder of Sean Cooper, a good cop, was never solved.",1
"< br / > < br / > In the story, Coop is single, a Vietnam war vet, with a deeply troubled past. I still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale. - Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. One key emotional scene was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy's baby.",1
"this was a fantastic episode. i wound up watching it with a friend of mine, who happens to be gay, and the two of us cried at the end.",1
Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in'68. I shall be watching this one in repeat! His case is reopened with the presumption that he was corrupted as a policeman.,1
It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters. Beautiful.,1
Americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed. All in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending.,1
"A must - see for any animation fan! But the story and the characters are so strong, it really doesn't matter.",1
De Mille goes West. The master of movie spectacle Cecil B.,1
One word can describe this movie and that is weird.,1
Galaxy Express 999 ( Ginga tetsudô Three - Nine ). Directed by Rintaro. Made in 1979.,1
"Yeah, it is.",1
< br / > < br / > I highly recommend this film.,1
"< br / > < br / > Many, many years passed... < br / > < br / > Last summer while I was in Korea, I was able to track down a copy of the original "" Galaxy Express 999 "" ( 1979 ) on DVD, and it brought back a lot of nostalgic, heartfelt memories. "" Those childhood memories... when things were new, and we were filled with curiosity about the world around us ; as we took those initial first steps in the long journey we call life.",1
"Boy, now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing? No, this hilariously horrible 70's made - for - TV horror clinker isn't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake.",1
"< br / > < br / > It's worth watching. Does the dog have something to do with it? Before Cujo, there was Lucky the devil dog. Coencidence?",1
"Later, on repeat, I saw I made right choice.",1
"Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane, nobody that I know played it better than her. A lot of care was taken to show original guns of that time.",1
"I've seen this movie more than once. Leaving off the first part,'Hound of Hell'would have sufficed. But this was an enjoyable Halloween fare offered by the CBS network.",1
"No, not very. ). The grainy film quality. There's just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films. The odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything.",1
Beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details.,1
Whatever you do - don't miss it. like this.,1
"Or did that "" feeling "" decide to pack its bags and say "" goodbye "" somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history, and then never came back? Just watch Bakovic and Cerar. Or did it? Uh. Because for me, it came back the first time I saw "" Ekspres, Ekspres "".",1
What waste.,1
Cinema after all is a visual media and Igor used its full potential. In one of the compartments he meets with a girl.,1
"Not pompous like the British, not Gung - Ho like the Americans. Just look at examples like Gallipoli ; Paschendale ; Tobruk ; New Guinea and Vietnam.",1
"A fate for which, as westerners, they are unprepared.",1
This movie starts out with Lincoln's assassination and it also deals with an Indian war. This movie also deals with Custer's last stand and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and i usually don't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here.,1
"The consequences of such an infraction, by Japanese martial code, is execution by beheading. But I can promise you - - you'll never forget it.",1
"You won't be disappointed, just awe. If you can find any type of copy of this - - buy or rent it.",1
Get one copy today and be mesmerized. But captain remains adamant on confessing this to the Japanese authorities. This is the Highest Honor accorded to the captured warriors in Japan. < br / > < br / > I won't give away the ending here.,1
"< br / > < br / > This film succeeds on that level as well. Unforgettable movie. It speaks of "" The Highest Honor "" and that honor is doing the right thing.",1
Brrrrrrr.,1
That is not very normal. < br / > < br / > Richard Widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples. This is a pretty decent example of film noir.,1
< br / > < br / > The acting across the board is fantastic.,1
He is a professional pickpocket. The sets show it is a limited budget film. Hoover wanted it changed. Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark.,1
So please take time out to watch this classic western.,1
"But I did find the river. 66. Watch their faces! She didn't get the Oscar. Thelma Ritter did steal the picture. If you have seen, no elucidation is necessary.",1
"See for instance Shirley Jones in "" Elmer Gantry. Especially good is the set representing the New York City subways and Widmark's shack near river. The story line goes something like this. One forgets how beautiful she was, and she handles this role very well.",1
"And what a third act. It may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money. Widmark is one only a few actors I can think of who could've really pulled off this character. He's a little like Bugs Bunny, as he can be a wise - ass who is a little sneaky.",1
It's truly shocking in its reality. Yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable. There is a scene in which Jean Peters get roughed up by Widmark.,1
"The plot thickens, people start dying, and Widmark and Peters fall in love.",1
"I'm not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either way. Why do we ( the audience ) want to like him so much? But the real question is what's going on with Skip? What are his motives, and why does Candy like him so much? It turns out Candy was doing a favor for her ( ex? )",1
"Will he turn in the MacGuffin to the proper authorities, or sell it to the highest bidder?",1
She's particularly touching in her final scene with Kiley. They're on her trail when the theft occurs.,1
"For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market. Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it. ). Only in world of film!!",1
"It is amusing to see Anthony Quinn in an early appearance as a Cheyenne Indian. Gabby Hayes is in there somewhere, but you miss him in the crowd. Gary Cooper overtops them all, looming large, - but when did he ever loom small? sometimes. She really pulled it off! 'The story is a pastiche to end all pastiches.",1
"9 out of 10. Who Done It? "" A true Stooge classic. Will they find Goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice? )",1
never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street.,1
Thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges.,1
"With a running length of under 80 minutes, PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is tough, gritty, explosive and endlessly entertaining. However, when Widmark lifts it, Peters must do whatever it takes to re - claim the film she ( initially ) knows nothing about. And he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed Peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet. < br / > < br / > Peters gets her best role as the moll - with - a - heart - of - gold Candy.",1
"It's one of few times on film you'll see a woman punched square in the mouth! They know she is a link in a long espionage chain. See this film. At first, I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted.",1
10 / 10. and anyone who watches this film will agree.,1
"Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America's great directors. I'm not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywood's great craftsmen. Pickup on South Street is a case in point. He had to make do. One of the most appealing characters, Moe Williams, is a stoolie.",1
< br / > < br / > Director Samuel Fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of New York City. Communist spies and shady government operatives all blend together to make Pickup On South Street a riveting viewing from first minute to the last.,1
Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss. Its good film.,1
"Really humane. It was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed. < br / > < br / > I also really liked the characters within this movie. Panic in the Streets "" is another movie like that that springs to the mind.",1
"The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing. "" Pickup On South Street "" is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists. One of the agents continues to tail her back to Joey's apartment and the other, Zara ( Willis Bouchey ), visits Police Captain Dan Tiger ( Murvyn Vye ). Two FBI agents had been following Candy and witnessed the theft. When Skip is brought into Tiger's office, Zara tells him about microfilm and Tiger offers to drop any charges if he'll co - operate with the investigation. Skip is flippant and arrogant. He clearly doesn't trust Tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subway.",1
"He, Buffalo Bill Cody, and Calamity Jane, are the central characters. It worked ; the line stayed in. This film provides the saga of a legendary Wild Bill Hickock.",1
I really enjoyed this film.,1
"It has it all. Ahh yes. The dames, the villians, the cigars and thuggish cops! I watched this last night on TV ( HBO ). This movie delivered all the goods to me. It was classic.",1
This should have been role that copped it for her!,1
"Exciting, atmospheric, tough as nails.",1
10 / 10. Richard Widmark is great. The film is absolutely beautiful.,1
Throw me in. < br / > < br / > The real star of this movie is New York. < br / > < br / > Jean Peters is radiant as Candy.,1
"Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made. Later, in her apartment, you are not seeing a movie - - you're seeing a real person. Wonderful stuff.",1
"Here is one situation you can't squirm out Ms Mitchell! < br / > < br / > Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice. She is selfish and demanding. Worse, she has now set herself up as judge, jury and executioner against her dead niece's husband.",1
"The plot is pretty good. I've always liked Columbo, though, somehow without even having seen that much of him. That's 35 years. The series consists of 68 films ( unless my count is off ), all of which are made for TV.",1
"Going through Edmund's apartment Columbo is puzzled to find out that he doesn't have a single photo of his late wife, who's been missing for just a month! All the evidence points to Abigil including a pair of missing car keys that was Edmunds. Veronica discovered Edmund's body as she was about to put away, for safe keeping, Abigail's latest murder mystery manuscript. In fact Abigail is convinced that he murdered her and made it look like a tragic accident.",1
"The first in order of production was this film, starring Gary Cooper as Wild Bill Hickok, with Jean Arthur as Calamity Jane. < br / > < br / > Basically the film takes up the history of the U. S. after the Civil War. Then he announces he has to go to the theater. But he had been involved in actual problems with the West.",1
What humor there is comes from Gordon. Her acting is idiosyncratic. Columbo doesn't have any of his frequent comic moments.,1
This is one of the best of many great Columbo installment.,1
It is established that the light doesn't work in the vault.,1
Columbo hunting down a detective / murder novel writer had been done more than once before in a Columbo movie. The movie has a great written genre story. She has some great interaction as well with Peter Falk in their sequences together. < br / > < br / > An even better than usual Columbo movie entry.,1
I love this episode of Columbo.,1
"I have a lot of time for all the Columbo films, but this one in particular was extremely well written, and the solution at the end very effective. Superb. He's deep in meditation, puffing gently on a cigar, swirls of smoke from the cigar circling slowly upwards as he thinks. The camera slowly moves out of the room and up towards him.",1
"I particularly like the interaction between Columbo and the killer, Ruth Gordon. A top notch Columbo from beginning to end.",1
Don't waste time reading my review. 10 / 10... seek this one out on Netflix!,1
"There's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. It's Universal! BOTTOM LINE : As pseudo - history painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies don't distract.",1
This episode of Columbo is in a class by itself. I recommend it most highly. To tell more would be unthinkable.,1
"Others by the at times brutal violence. The fact that these are four average men, albeit slightly unhinged, is the key to why the film works as well as it does. Some may be put off by the slow - burn nature of the opening scenes, or abrupt ending. It's a truly great, understated performance, her transformation from victim to aggressor is seamlessly played.",1
"< br / > < br / > The movie in question, should be seen by this point of view.",1
"He pins her up against the wall. He is on his cellphone arguing with a business partner I would assume. She notices a car coming up behind her and it blocks her from backing up. Odd. She tends to the children, trying to comfort them. Then she goes in the mall to do her last minute shopping. < br / > < br / > The movie opens on Christmas Eve. She also notices that the note she left under the wiper is no longer there. When she gets to her vehicle, she gets in to start it up. The twin's watch from the stairs.",1
"So I decided not to see it. < br / > < br / > It's clear that a remake of such a famous film as ` Planet of the Apes'is automatically influenced by commercial thinking. Still, Tim Burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as ` Beetlejuice'or ` Batman '. So all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film, e. g. by referencing to quotes.",1
! If you want a good ape movie watch the original.,1
"I took it as parallel universe. Visually, it's incredible.",1
I hope no one casts him as Tarzan. Lisa Marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy. Even the chaste Helena Bonham Carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain.,1
"I thought it was hysterical. On the surface, this is an above - average post - war romantic comedy.",1
Donna Reed charming and pretty.,1
Good acting and not over top. The romance is clean and endearing. They don't make movies like this anymore. It does not do justice to this incredible movie.,1
I loved this movie!! ! A definite must see for total romantic.,1
It'll blow you away. I read the book and saw the movie. Both excellent.,1
"Lightning paced, there is not one unimportant throwaway scene here. S? These two make all the comedy aspects of the story work - displaying a palpable frustration mixed with gutsy determination. It is a minor masterpiece from the 1970s. These two cops start out as safety - division rookies, busting dealers in plainclothes in their spare time. But instead of receiving applause from the city police department, they receive nothing but resistance and antagonism from their peers.",1
This film has slipped through the cracks of film history.,1
I've a feeling we would have seen a much more risqué film. < br / > < br / > And it's men of means that Jean Harlow is after. Harlow and Kelly have the same easy chemistry between that Patsy had with Thelma. If the themes of The Girl From Missouri sound familiar it should. After that he is not amused and he looks to shake Jean from climbing the family tree. Still she wrangles a few baubles from him that fellow millionaire Lionel Barrymore notices.,1
"Lionel Barrymore is T. R. Paige, another rich, uppercrust who comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for Eadie. Fun, cleancut romp as the girls chase men around the country. ), but all is not as it seems... I wonder what that line would have been just couple years earlier before the Hayes code came rolling into town. What was he really saying?",1
"With her platinum hair & gorgeous accouterments, she is a dazzler. She has rightfully earned her spot at the very top of the Hollywood pantheon. < br / > < br / > Jean Harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy.",1
See it... before it'too late!,1
"Quite a change from today's standard fare. ) April Love is light and easy to watch, a feel good movie.",1
"And check out Todd's other short films also popping up here and there from time to time : "" Single Spaced "" and "" Slug 660 "". It is hilarious. Or not.",1
Go and see SOLINO!,1
< br / > < br / > nice nice nice.,1
Such a delightful movie! Very heart warming.,1
This movie about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just great!,1
"You should watch film yourself, it's a nice one - I have also made a Referat about it and examined scenes which show different cultural attitudes. etc.",1
A really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry.,1
How exciting is that!,1
"- yes, but an outrageous movie. 9 out of 10. Especially Gigi, the main actor.",1
But also because he is NOT the main actor. What follows is a great - and totally neutral - look at what life can become formed by the choices you make. Gigi's dream to become a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. I adored this movie.,1
"The supporting cast lent credit to their individual roles. Only wish I could find it again! It was a musical, but also romantic, funny, and clever.",1
"Then, too, the'modern'segment is weakly written. Yes, the film has its problems, but the score is not one of them. During a Kurt Weill celebration in Brooklyn, WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? was finally unearthed for a screening.",1
I happened to see this movie twice or more and found it well made! : ),1
"It is cute, cheerful, and pure fluff, and you can't help but like it.",1
"Something like that. I don't find ANYTHING hilarious anymore. MacMurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army. ( Ho hum, right? Otto Preminger is the suspicious and sinister Hessian general. """,1
"Then, too, the'modern'segment is weakly written. Yes, the film has its problems, but the score is not one of them. During a Kurt Weill celebration in Brooklyn, WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? was finally unearthed for a screening.",1

It is very good comedy. ! I surely like it!!!,1
Serbia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection.,1
"But nobody in USA has heard of it, which is a real shame! Talk about surprised! Actually I'm surprised there were so many comments about this movie. The dynamics between the people are what makes it both funny and sad. Serb humor at it's best!",1

* Did I mention it is one of funniest movies I've ever seen?,1
"A masterpiece one should not miss to see ( preferably with subtitles, and not dubbed ).",1
A terrible shame.,1

You feel content.,1
"I got what I expected... but only half. I didn't buy the dinner sequence. I mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these days. < br / > < br / > Alain Chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance. There are moments involving S & M, funny lines with Chabat's best friend, some lesbian references, funny situations involving the family women, and more. I think the supporting cast do what they can. Plus, the humor is versatile. I have to be 100 % honest with you fellow IMDb users. < br / > < br / > I understand it's a movie and that's why I accept it as a funny situation. I'm in love with that woman!",1
Everything's great. The direction was great. Boring....??? I can't understand why some people say she's not.,1
"< br / > < br / > So far one of the best 50 or so Films I have seen this year, and well worth five start rating. Truly rewarding to watch, and again one that only the French seam capable to make.

"BUT they all didn't matter. < br / > < br / > The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply exquisite. < br / > < br / > The setting was interesting, strange but interesting. I cannot guarantee everyone will like it, but I hope YOU do.",1
"But, like I said, Chabat is a fine actor and he can do charm when he needs to.",1
< br / > < br / > Alain Chabat was absolutely terrific. I at least can't wait to find DVD which offers subtitles ( Hello Australia? And the tears shed were all of laughter. Please? ) because that film I need at home to watch several more times!,1
"Of course the best laid plans have a habit of spiralling out of control. French farce with an English. Enter the delightful, charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan. No more talk of marriage from G7.",1
The writing was excellent. I loved it.,1
Thank you again Mr. Kasden,1
This film is a definite must see!! ! At times I find it empowering. And I always find the characters human and real. This movie awed me so much that I watch it at least once a year.,1
"And the CAST!!! No one out of place or out of character. < br / > < br / > If you havent seen it, DO!",1
It stands out as an enjoyable classic.,1
"Erika Christensen was good but Busy stole the show. Forget Mona Lisa Smile, see Home Room.",1
What a mixture of events! Most of us have had this uncanny experience.,1
"I usually smile and say "" life "". Definately must see for everyone.",1
"Her body language. What / IS / this world coming to, anyway?",1
"SO its a very'real'movie. I never tire of watching it. And lastly, Mary McDonell is brilliant as always.",1
Especially when you compare endings. No matter how good... bad you are.,1
"Similarly, to pigeonhole it in a particular genre is futile. A sparkling film with a great cast and everything working. Grand Canyon is a very strange bird.",1
com / 62229249. myspace. I truly believe that before the movie Crash there was Grand Canyon.,1
"It affirms Kevin Kline as my favorite actor. But either way, "" Grand Canyon "" is a great movie. It just goes to show the state of race relations in America.",1
"Before there was Crash, there was this interesting film called Grand Canyon. Both men are threatened, but Simon manages to get himself, Mack, and the car out of dire straits.",1
"Kasdan wants to present life, simply, ordinary life. What is a miracle? Well, life itself, for a start. Hopefully we haven't heard last from Larry Kasdan. A great film from a great artist.",1
They stole show. Very enjoyable film.,1
"They threaten violence if he doesn't leave his car. He then announces retirement from producing blood and gore entertainment. < br / > < br / > It is very rare in Hollywood, or Although Glover denies it later, he probably saved Kline's life. Or is it pure luck? A producer ( Steve Martin ) of cheap violent films gets shot in the leg and after wards has a spiritual experience. Is possible something else is going on? "" Quinten Tarrantino took an acting class whose instructor knew Harvey Keitel. She claims the baby cried for her and that her "" rescue "" of the infant was preordained.",1
"The writers deserved an Oscar. It's not typical, and was an unexpected surprise. < br / > < br / > All in all? < br / > < br / > I really enjoyed the intelligence this exhibited. I was very impressed with this work, and will be adding it to the DVD collection soon. Kline is the straight - the suit - the conformist of the film, and as such his performance is crisp and refreshing. < br / > < br / > This work deals with life in all aspects.",1
"I still enjoy it again and again. He, too does an excellent job in this movie. then you've missed a special treat.",1
Go ahead and watch it. Exception made for Kevin Kline who was perfect.,1
"It also succeeds because of Lawrence Kasdan's skillful direction and writing. I first saw the film when I was 17 years old. How did I hear about it? But why the poor reviews for this movie? "". But it delivers with an intensity and force that seems supple. < br / > Maltin's movie guide gives it two out of four.",1
"Upon revisiting it, I think history supports my initial reaction!",1
"I cried every time I saw it. < br / They aren't showy or overblown and there's no long pause to examine the moment carefully. The film moves on at the pace of life. It's always a short step, too. The couple rushes to his aid. I'm crying now. That's PERFECT! What tears me up is that this few minutes of film was PERFECT. That's a very trite and shorthand method of describing what Grand Canyon does. Astounding. Just to manage that swing with grace and without making it look false or exaggerated is directorial genius.",1
I would choose Grand Canyon over Crash any day.,1
But the movie is also timeless.,1
"9 out of 10. The dialogue, acting, casting and direction are superb.",1
"< br / > < br / > An excellent movie, especially as a date movie during lousy weather.",1
"These are of course not quoted from the film, but generalities. Some answers are not.",1
"Gangland violence is real, right? Is it right, no! It'very nearly perfect in my view. I'll keep this one quite short.",1
"In my top 5. < br / > < br / > I have a pretty level sap - meter. You may be seeing only black and white yourself, eh. Absolutely mesmerizing. And the chasm. Realistic human performances from all the actors. Not a hand - out. The buzzer never went off during this film. Just a thought. < br / > < br / > Personally, the movie affected me significantly. The ending confused me ). What he may have failed to recognize, is, there was a hand shake. Exponentially.",1
YES the law is drawn VERY badly in Bleak House. I know of only a few ). I suppose someone who could mistake the name of DENHOLM Eliott for Desmond isn't really an appreciator of English art ( film or literature ). This is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right. < br / > < br / > Has theowinthrop actually seen the series? It fails Miss Flyte.,1
This would not be possible with Bleak House. The answer is simple : the book is full of padding. You don't need to read this review. < br / > < br / > This production needs its seven hours. The more important issue is that it doesn't always tell the story very effectively. A few random examples will illustrate the problems.,1
In the end I got a DVD copy from Canada.,1
"We can believe Dickens'London looked, sounded, and thought a lot like this. Twice, Elliott's character describes it as "" a curse. "" ( So I gather from Wikipedia. ) Another is a poor and helpless young boy. < br / > < br / > The acting too is to be applauded.",1
"In meantime - I think it is a good presentation. I am sorry, I think she is the best Lady Dedlock...",1
Now read the book! Esther had no uncle.,1
"Esther is raised by her aunt and uncle, who ( in typical Dickens style ) mistreat her. In OUR MUTUAL FRIEND he looks at testators and wills. In THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD he apparently was going to go to a murder trial. Starting with the breach of promise case in PICKWICK PAPERS, Dickens looked closely at the law. Later we get involved with the gentry, Sir Leicester Dedlock, and his wife. She is illegitimate, but they won't tell her anything about her parentage.",1
!,1
"over all a brilliant, moving and atmosphereic film.",1
"I didn't like the fact also that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer. The main problem was the pacing, it is rather slow, and there are some scenes where very little happens. 7 / 10 Bethany Cox. On the whole, despite some misjudgements on the writers'behalf, I liked Murder in Mesopotamia.",1
Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. It is a must see movie for 2005.,1
Really delightful. And it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find. That guy's right eye has more character than most actors today. Who wouldn't want to go on road trip with Peter Falk?,1
"Great, original jokes. This was one of the few truly funny movies I've seen.",1
"The movie is funny, poignant and thought - provoking.",1
"I thought better of him and think less of him for this movie. Certainly not worth spending money on, though it might be worth watch for free on television.",1
This is must see movie.,1
The actors and actresses are fantastic.,1
I just wish they'd release it on DVD because I'm wearing my tape version out!,1
It was delightful and a little bit of a'romp '.,1
"< br / > < br / > I know, that sounds heavy.",1
"This movie didn't really surprise me, as such, it just got better and better. Must be unlisted or something. Let's see. And I hadn't even been drinking! I thought : "" Paul Rieser wrote this, huh? Well... we'll see how he does... "" Then I saw Peter Falk was in it.",1
"Both men seem to break out of their daily lives. With them away, the daughters can play detectives. It becomes a story of courage and human spirit in the face of adversity. It's never too late to change.",1
WOW!,1
"It is no wonder it took Paul Reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romance / comedy. This part of the movie will shine off as good as the other parts, a great soundtrack for a Romance / Comedy thats for sure. A perfect outcome, it is no wonder this movie is that perfect and won that many prices. it doesn't happen everyday that you can create a story like I can understand every part of it, this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear, or thousands.",1
"The combination of the two is magic. < br / > < br / > Gret movie and great story and plot. At times, his eyes look so sad.",1
Peter Falk's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film. Plenty of reality based humor & some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own family. < br / > < br / > Very well written with an adult target audience in mind.,1
The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members. One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving! Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living. Grady Harp Well worth viewing.,1
"But that's not the end of their journey. Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh. And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie. It's just hilarious when they go fishing. Nobody, I can tell you that.",1
"Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. Each has their own "" thing "" that they contend with. It didn't try to pound a lesson into us.",1
Because it shows what a talent Peter Falk is.,1
So spouse and I took a chance. It should be shared with the world.,1
"Only about 5 for me. "" No violence or nudity but some strong language. So fortunate were we to see this fantastic film at the Palm Springs International Film festival.",1
I am surprised this didn't make it into general release. 0 to 8.,1
I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this film. Let's only hope they'll have the chance. It was an excellent film about adult family relationships.,1
"< br / > < br / > Peter Falk is magnificent in the film. The Thing About my Folks "" came in as a surprise. The love of Sam for Muriel spans the many years they have known one another ; they seem inseparable. Along the way, father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children. The trip provides the excuse for Ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew about because the old man had always projected an aloof figure to his younger son. "" We had no idea about what to expect.",1
"It was beautifully done, from cinematography to the acting. The father presents himself, unannounced, on the doorstep of his son and daughter - in - law. But more important, they each confront the unspoken tensions that can affect any family. It's the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them. The father and son take off next day to look at some property and end up taking a classic road trip. I saw the film at the Nashville Film Festival.",1
"Definitely worth seeing, so judge for yourself!",1
"). My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book. I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film, and so decided to buy her the videotape. Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination.",1
"com More time passes and the husband ends up taking her to court when he learns that she has borne him a son without telling him. The part of "" Gig Young "" was played by actor Byron Barr who later assumed name before he became famous.",1
The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. I'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week! The music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable.,1
"When we're asked to sympathize with him late in film, it's impossible. Weird, eh? Coleman's was my favorite performance in the film. Gig Young is played by, huh?, Gig Young. He isn't very good. Charles Barclay is played by George Brent.",1
"< br / > < br / > If you're Stanwyck fan, this is a no miss. But Fiona's keeping a secret as to why she hates Barclay so much.",1
Very good.,1
"Tim Roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil Archibald, yet somehow, it works. Liam Neeson, as usual, is fantastic, a sexy beast you can't take your eyes off of. I just recently watched it again, and loved it every bit as much as the first time. I first saw Rob Roy twelve years ago. Honestly, this man is like ice cream : even when he's bad he's good.",1
"This factor has to do both with the sets and locations of the film as well as the wardrobe. Then, he sends them away and beautifully makes love to his woman. For me, the most splendid scene was in the Highlands when Rob Roy tells his boys what honor really means.",1
This makes it a more interesting film. The story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity. Go and see it! Much like Gladiator. Overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch.,1
The setting is amazing.,1
"Second, this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more. I loved this movie. If you don't have one, there's not much joy in rooting for good guys. On two fronts, however, "" Rob Roy "" scored far above average. I could give numerous examples, but why should I?",1
"The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. I absolutely loved this movie. So sorry about this.",1
One of my favorites. The fight scenes are amazing.,1
"In contrast, Rob Roy has grown on me over the years. Partly because it largely avoids the faults I mind most in Braveheart.",1
He really is a magnificent bastard in this movie. 10 out of 10. His rape of Mary is repugnant and harrowing. SOME MILD SPOILERS WITHIN.,1
< br / > < br / > The acting performances are superb! ! < br / > < br / > This is a top 50 movie!! I question anyone saying they don't care for this movie. Don't listen to them!!!,1
"Rob Roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the Marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves. Rob Roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that Braveheart was. Sounds fair enough, doesn't it? He rapes Macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home. This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come.",1
"What makes this film is the cast. Rob Roy, by contrast, is slightly less polished, but a better film by far.",1
He is a true actor. Mary is such a beautiful woman. They need each other.,1
"< br / > < br / > The action was also very well done and gripping. I was particularly impressed by the apparently genuine dialog. The early to mid 90s were a high point, in my opinion, for the historical drama. I can imagine this is how early 18th century people spoke and behaved. I would recommend it to all.",1
"Rob Roy is a stubborn, proud, courageous, and honest man whose word can be trusted. Like Braveheart to which it is frequently compared, it is not very historical. He temporarily entrusts this money to his friend, Alan McDonald.",1
"Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Apparently, I am not alone. The film is a definite keeper. Many have already asked. It has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out.",1
"< br / > < br / > All in all just shy of a classic. This is a very good, under - rated action / drama / and slightly historical movie. The story is good and you really want Rob to win.",1
"One of my favorite films. This movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to all. Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role.",1
"Also recommended : "" The Last of the Mohicans "" and "" The Patriot. "" It's also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. Its violence is both ugly and glorious. And Tim Roth is a superlative villain.",1
"Rob Roy may be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. He's a legend, a martyr, a larger than life figurehead. I like "" Braveheart "" a lot, but the idea of comparing it to "" Rob Roy "" is a little insulting to me. To put quite simply, I love "" Braveheart "", but it is a pale shadow to how much I love "" Rob Roy "". But alas... < br / > < br / > it constantly, and unfairly gets compared to "" Braveheart "". When he finally does fail, it is not to his fault. < br / > < br / > Let's face it, William Wallace in "" Braveheart "" is not a real person. But it really doesn't inspire or intrigue me. < br / > < br / > The depiction of Wallace is very well done and effective.",1
"I find this "" pro - life "" stance on the part of the hero to be very un - Hollywood. MAJOR SPOILERS!! leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene. The second character to find herself pregnant is Mary, Rob's wife, after a rape by Roth's character ( and at least one sex scene with her husband, Rob ). ) The first character to get pregnant is the villain's ( Roth ) girlfriend, and when he coldly suggests an abortion, she states it is too late for that. Rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment - - not coincidental symbolism. Rob replies in a noble tone, "" it's not the fault of the child, "" and then states what he thinks name should be, girl or boy.",1
I loved it.,1
"Both do their jobs well. This is one powerful film. Here, it's Liam Neeson ( good ) vs. Tim Roth ( evil ). It is excellent.",1
"Honor, in his view, seems a quaint notion... He is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service... He is intelligent, fair and virile...",1
"Not a single scene is wasted. < br / > < br / > There have been several comparisons made with Braveheart, which came out the same year. Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping.",1
< br / > < br / > NOTE to would - be filmmakers.,1
There's nothing noble in that. The Missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the Confederate Army.,1
"There is motivation, and a method to his madness. You're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse. The main character is one we can identify, and at least have some sympathy for. This movie is an example. < br / > < br / > It begins a bit campy, but really improves.",1
Lots of exciting scenes. A thoroughly good ride. I am absolutely a fan of Maguire's. Check out Cider House Rules.,1
"< br / > < br / > A noble, optimistic film. 7 / 10",1

"However, it is seldom every seen on cable.",1
< br / > < br / > Completely overlooked movie. As was Jeffery Wright. I have strong suspicions. Which makes it all more appealing to me.,1
Worth seeing.,1
"When I heard this film was directed by Ang Lee, I made sure to see it. He gives a fine and understated performance. These never officially joined the Confederate army. And their costumes are too new. < br / > < br / > This story takes place in Missouri, a Union state with Southern sympathies. Now, he turns his attention to another American icon - - the Civil War.",1
"< br / > < br / > Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict. Yes there were liberties taken on the actual events, as all fiction is apt to do. Beautifully photographed and performed, it harkens back to the days of the great western epics. They cannot believe that 19th century farmers would "" talk like poets "". The stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film. But the overall feel of the film is genuine. Please rent this film.",1
"Further Deponent Saith Not. It says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others the cast. Most highly recommended, particularly if you are a romantic at heart. In short the film is, well, enchanting.",1
It is a reminder of Kosovo to - day. A great film....,1
Besides some superb action scenes ( quite bloody at times ).,1
"The scene of the attack of Lawrence, Kansas is awesome. Definitely worth seeing.",1
Such is the true sense of film being a genre of art.,1
). Who are we to fight?! It even has first CW cavalry battle put on film recently. What I'm refering to is the tendency of films'music and lighting to make you feel the mood you'd expect to feel.,1
"And they will have to ride with the very Devil himself, against seemingly insurmountable odds.",1
9 out of 10.,1
This was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all.,1
"The action is unglamorised and admirably candid, recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocities. < br / > < br / > The performances are superb, with Maguire and Wright both courageous and dignified. Jake Roedel ( Tobey Maguire ) is such a man, or rather, boy, as he is only seventeen when the war reaches Missouri.",1
Not just one or two... this movie really jelle! And she's good! I gave it a 10 rating. This movie is one of the sleepers of all time. Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel.,1
My all - time favorite movie.,1
This movie was wonderfully written. The movie was deep. Toby Maguire was awesome. A civil war movie is not the typical movie I watch. The actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular. She was amazingly good. The spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie.,1
"Neither is about idealism, though, as seen in Gone with the Wind. Was the war about slavery and an abolitionism? The letter scenes are very moving and yet subtle.",1
"< br / > < br / > What really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to over - dramatize. Don't watch if if you want non - stop action or heart - renting emotion. This movie is cool, observant, and generally light - handed in its judgement, which is GOOD. And I take it very gratefully that she's not a weeping widow.",1
Check her out in other things you would be surprised. It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand. The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long.,1
A good film worth watching several times annually. A class A film with fine acting and directing.,1
"The film smartly avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides ( pro - Castro? ), plays a homeless bum who acts as Greek chorus, superbly.",1
"Unfortunately, this just makes the film little less convincing. Recommended. Harvey Keital's best performance so far the new century.",1
"DREAMING OF JULIA makes much more sense. < br / > < br / > The revolution, like the film JULIE, never seems to have ending. It is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love.",1
"However, don't expect this to be a movie about the revolution, it's political stance is wonderfully ambiguous. < br / > < br / > Enjoy!",1
"I saw this film and heard the writer - director, Juan Gerard, speak at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Gerard's wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life. < br / > < br / > What this film really is is the culmination of a dream. I would definitely see it again, and hope that he continues his film career. The last half is much better as events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet, and honest climax.",1
"It is a film about middle age and the choices people make. It deserved Todd - AO, Technicolor and the very finest sound format available. ( An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter. ) As it is, it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film. Watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you.",1
"Another fine example of this genre is Onmyoji ( 2001 ). Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography, and editing. Brilliant, even.",1
The body - count is countless.,1
GOJOE is one of the better samurai movies to come around post - Kurosawa. < br / > < br / > Not to be missed.,1
"That said, the beginning and the ending of the film are nevertheless both elegant and powerful. < br / > < br / > Other problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. The audience can't be sure of this, either, until the very end of the film. Luckily, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly, tragic side of violence as well. For a film with such an anti - violent message Gojoe wastes way too much energy and screen time to depict the endless battle scenes. ), so the end result is somewhat tiring. As incredible as it may seem, Gojoe is an anime - and Hong Kong - inspired samurai action flick with a pacifistic message.",1
The music is really good. Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre. The lead actors are uniformly excellent. The two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes. And the fight scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close - ups.,1
"< br / > < br / > Ultimately, a moral tale. It is a film I would like to see again. Intense.",1
I have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie.,1
"I personally thought the movie was pretty good, very good acting by Tadanobu Asano of Ichi the Killer fame. Another solid effort by Tadanobu Asano in my opinion.",1
The scenery breath - taking and the message of love genuine. This is what I call a growth movie.,1
"Of the leads Masatoshi Nagase rounds things out as an ordinary man, smart and cynical but still unaware of just exactly what the stakes are. Benkei is even more hampered here by the fact that his dark nature makes him fundamentally at odds with the world, even when not in open conflict he is never at ease. Actingwise Daisuke Ryu is dignified and powerful with a mysterious savagery as Benkei, while Tadanobu Asano has a driven, cold arrogance as Prince Shanao. One of the less widely lauded of recent Asian period action affairs Gojoe is an at first slow and often curious but overall pretty terrific offering, exciting, layered and beautiful.",1
"It is a time of demons. This movie rates as one of my all time favourite top 10 movies. Yoshitsune's depiction in Gojo nicely accommodates all of this. This movie is a revision of that story however and involves war, dark prophecy, and political maneuvering. The scenery This is said to be where ninja clans began historically. During the fight according to legend Yoshitsune bests Benkei and the monk becomes the prince's loyal retainer.",1
Recommended!,1
"So you don't get to know the characters on that deeper level. I give movie a 7 / 10. Will Kathleen be able to win his trust? What motivates their choices? Her life is not so simple as it seems, however.",1

). This is a neat little crime drama which packs a lot into its 65 minute running time.,1
< br / > < br / > Rating : 3 stars out of 5. Excellent but rather obscure.,1
"Obviously it is following in the steps of "" Dragnet "" and "" Naked City "" but emerges as an enjoyable programmer. Here it is in all its seedy glory, from the old - school tattoo parlors to the cheap hotels to the greasy spoons. Walter Kinsella is stuffy and droll as the older detective Corrigan. This police procedural is no worse than many others of its era and better than quite a few. What bosh!",1
< br / > < br / > This is clearly a B type movie.,1
Well worth watching.,1
What a little gem of a film!,1
"It is, however, rather good! There's not a great deal of bloodshed, but Bava does get to do a little bit with the special effects. She is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an Ogre living in her basement.",1
"I guess the film's TV origins explain the last act. Yes, I know it has nothing to do with "" Demons "" apart from one cast member and the crew. Alright, before we review, I have to ask : why isn't this listed individually? Great atmosphere and terror follow. The Ogre "" is an original. < br / > < br / > The multiple nightmare sequences were pretty freaky. And the monster itself was a scary one, when it was presented correctly.",1
"I'm sorry but I can relate both films very easily and I'm not saying that as an accusation. As a matter of fact, Michele Soavi's "" The Church "" is also known an unofficial "" Demons 3 "" and it's a deceptive title in that case as well, so go figure. Honestly, the movie is quite atmospheric and even though there are a few unintentionally hilarious situations, I thought it was genuinely creepy on the whole. Leaving Nevertheless, I think it's fair to say that the story somehow tries to emulate Lucio Fulci's "" The House by the Cemetery "". To anyone who hasn't seen this film yet, I have a friendly warning : don't watch "" La Casa dell'Orco "" expecting any demons at all, because you won't find them here. Of course, that's just a speculation I have, but I think I have my valid evidences. Having said that, I think it's unfair on the other hand, to say that "" La Casa dell'Orco "" is not worth the look.",1
"I give "" The Ogre "" 7 out of 10. Just don't expect it to be like the other Demons films. Italian fans should try it out. If you can get past "" Demons III "" in the title, you might some enjoyment in "" The Ogre "". And with the "" Demons III "" in the title, one would assume it would.",1
"It runs a crisp 76 minutes, and that's just as well, because material doesn't really have the legs to go any further.",1
"Yes, I call this a perfect movie. There was nothing this actress couldn't do, and she always went easy on the melodramatic side. I can also recommend it.",1
"Her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking return. Overall, a fairly good show.",1
ALL AT THE SAME TIME! Saw this film yesterday for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it.,1
"This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as a compliment.",1
You knew what was going on and I liked it. Is he just getting old?,1

An entertaining diversion for fans of the MGM musical factory. This was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared in together.,1
"At first it is Clarence who is interested in wooing "" Aunt Susan "" but eventually Kelly's character emerges as the more likely candidate. It's a startling sequence for its time but doesn't have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time. There the patrons happily allow Ms.",1

Still this is worth catching. Tom does a funny cameo too. There's more but you've probably guessed it. Grayson is given nothing to do but she's incredibly beautiful to look at.,1
"You are going to have to see movie to see what I mean. Sort of like the Music Man when he gets "" his foot caught in the door "". This one is different. And if you had to make up a "" story "" to get her - so be it - until. < br / > < br / > Why not a 10?",1
I loved them all for every diverse element brought into film.,1
"Iturbi's piano work is beautiful. Clarence falls for her. For Kelly, this was a major break for him at MGM. Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings. < br / > < br / > Wonderful movie, very buoyant.",1

The sequence is nicely done. < br / > < br / > But the sequence of the cartoon with Kelly took about seven minutes of the movie. Frank insists that Gene help "" teach him "" how to get a girl. Jerry Mouse does more than dance with Gene.",1
"Everyone wanted Iturbi back then. Depressing how quickly we forget. I get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970. < br / > < br / > And as to the lack of a plot, Americans didn't need plot. Technicolor Musicals were what America thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed. Allow me to explain. Kelly was already well - known as a dancer, but Iturbi had by then been a world - wide sensation for 20 + years.",1
"Jose Iturbi does great job performing himself. Frank Sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from Brooklyn. Edgar Kennedy plays Chief of police station. Sara Berner is the voice of Jerry Mouse. It's so energetic. "" Also Tom Cat is seen there as the butler.",1
Great use was made of color and lighting throughout movie. The fabulous dancing that Kelly does? So what if he wasn't an actor? You'll feel good after seeing this movie. No. < br / > < br / > Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star.,1
"As another viewer noted, this seems almost to be a warm - up for On the Town. Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. At age 15, it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. However, observing his physique, it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean.",1
It is a must. See movie.,1
"He'd become friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. Mickey would have to wait until Who Framed Roger Rabbit to do an outside film. In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly got Sinatra to dance a bit. When Anchors Aweigh was finished, Fred Astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance. Kathryn Grayson didn't do too badly with this either. Louis B. Mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing. I sure can't do better than that. < br / > < br / > The main number everyone talks about with Gene Kelly here is the dance with Jerry Mouse.",1
"One of the best dancers of the 20th century. In every movie I have ever seen him in, he always steals show. You will NOT be disappointed. It is no wonder Paula Abdul "" sampled "" Kelly's moves.",1
"The numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot, and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in ANCHORS AWEIGH. And does Joe end up with Susie, who loves him too? I certainly felt length the first two times I saw it! How is Brooklyn going to take this betrayal? I'm not quite sure why this is.",1
Everything a musical comedy should be.,1
"Get your pause button ready, it's worth it!",1
"Tom finds out that Jerry did all of this, and chases him. Tom then accidentally bites the house maid. Well, this would fit into "" others. "" It felt slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts. Tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast, and becomes easily frightened. It makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this.",1
"As for humor, it's mostly dark humor. He angrily looks at Jerry for about a minute. Yet, Tom shows an incredible patience before reacting. Suspense is another strong element here. The atmosphere is dark and spooky.",1
"Here is a favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon perfect for Halloween. < br / > < br / > I love the ending, it was a little funny.",1
very old now but would still be fun for kids if you got hold of a copy. This film is NOT about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment.,1
The acting is a joy to watch in itself.,1
I love this film'Spring and port wine '.,1
< br / > < br / > What a wonderful film. 'Good advice. I've never forgotten'Are ye carrying? < br / > < br / > I stand by the comments tho '. Or any father at all.,1
"Or so it seems. Cleverly, the film, based on play, portrays the complexities of family life.",1
). Parents : Don't try too hard! < br / > < br / > This film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as relevent today as ever. < br / > < br / > The film is a classic.,1
"( Not much has changed there then!! ) To put it simply, I enjoyed this film.",1
"All in all, I liked this lighthearted, sometimes genre challenged, mini series.",1
!,1
The mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries. You won't want to miss if you've enjoyed what came before. ),1
All it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment.,1
"Busy, also did a great job with her role in this film. I was wrong. This movie sends a powerful message about judging others.",1
This is a romantic drama with many humorous undertones and a quick wit.,1
"You can readily understand why Robson Green would light her fire, with apologies to the "" Doors "". They are that good. It's a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. This group of English pros are a pleasure to watch.",1
The movie did not let me down. How wrong! to gum up. The seventies version?,1
"All of this seems natural in the context of the desolate foreboding Arctic setting. Highly recommended. Is there no hope for innocence? Will the Mounties get their man? Deceit, drunken orgies, rape, and death occur after the Eskimo men depart for work on the icy cold seas. Is there a way out that does not punish Mala? It is also usual for their women to want to take the place of the missing spouse. The audience would have cheered in the 1930's theaters. When an Eskimo man loses his mate, it is natural that other men share their women with their friend. Eventually the lead Eskimo ( Mala ) realizes that he has been duped and he takes his revenge.",1
Now who wants to talk about'Titanic'anymore?,1
"But they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is definitely worth look. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in the story.",1
"Foremost among them is that of Ray Wise, playing the leading role of Mala the Eskimo. While considered a documentary at the time, we would likely term it a'docudrama'as it is scripted with an intriguing plot & storyline.",1
"The actresses were great. It's a tub of love, "" says Lottie Wilkins. < br / > < br / > All their problems and their solutions are plausible.",1
"Adapted from a true story, the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving.",1
Other than this I feel sure that this is a film you will really enjoy.,1
"This really touched me and as a film, which is based on a true story, it convinced me. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it. Also I think the actor selections has succeeded perfectly. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the movie.",1
"A kid with ideals who tries to change things around him. A movie you can't hide from. A family who is falling apart, and fighting against it.",1
Try to watch it with this purpose!,1
! That film is absolutely fantastic!,1
"At least I did! Not only that, but as Geraldine, he looks HOT!",1
"Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye. An artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us.",1
He transmits these needs to the audience in a thoroughly believable fashion.,1
"This is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism ( of heterosexuals ). Not a big movie, neither an "" art "" film, but a little, lovely motion picture!",1
"Keaton's comedies are _ innerly, harmoniously, intelligently ordered, thought. At Keaton it's essentially the same couple ; and maybe the same is with Lang. And Wallace Beery makes a fine nemesis.",1
"Of course, the third segment takes place during modern times but this Teutonic aristocrat thinks that even 100 years ago should qualify as modern. < br / > < br / > Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http : / / ferdinandvongalitzien.",1
This is the movie that actually affected my life. This little film is a diamond of highest quality.,1
"Thus, There is some mild jumping back and forth between episodes. 'Keaton didn't have to. Keaton appears to allude to that film, as well.",1
Check it out!,1
"< br / > < And that lion - the manicure - just brilliant. The stories parallel each other as in Griffith's INTOLERANCE, which this was intended to satirize.",1
"Both him and Beery are after the Girl through the ages, a never ending tussle. So, it's rocky viewing in places, but I've seen and survived much worse. < br / > < br > Great stuff, reaffirming my love of silent film comedy.",1
"However, I don't believe that anyone has ever topped this comedy. There is nothing unique or daring about the story lines. In addition, Wallace Beery's appearance as Keaton's rival adds to this film's appeal.",1
The last 40 minutes were excellent. The actors are excellent.,1
Do see this if you get chance,1
You may ask yourself was A. C. Doyle a strong person or did he put himself in question. I saw the film for the first time at BBC on July the 27 of 2005.,1
The movie is anything but boring. I would give it 2 1 / 2 stars out of a 4 star system.,1
< br / > < br / > Typical 80s movie. No computer generated crap! Watch it and enjoy. He looks pretty young here... 17 years ago.,1
"< br / > < br / > Seeing "" Enchanted April "" is a very healing experience. Don't invite the kids, though. This movie is very low - key.",1
"Eventually they end up working together on the case. But it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie, at least in my opinion. Tony's friend had been watching the junk yard.",1
"Enjoyable soundtrack, good script, i give it 10 / 10.",1
Lewis's direction makes'this a near perfect comedy. I rated this a 9.,1
But I guess I know deep down that it's some sort of insanity that makes me like this movie. < br / > < br / > I'm giving this 7. to be honest I like it more than that. I'd rather watch this than lot of stuff I'd give 8.,1
I saw this movie recently.,1
Someone please convince Leno to do a sequel! And the climax.,1
The very first scene I watched him was really strong. Wow.,1
"In every other way it's just as formulaic as any standard product. At the time, "" My Left Foot "" was the little movie that could. That's not to say it isn't a good movie, but it's not a masterpiece.",1
"May not be for everyone, but not bad at all. Brenda Fricker, as Brown's devoted mother, also won an Oscar for a believable and touching role. < br > < br / > * * * out of * * * * Day - Lewis give Brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch. My problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times.",1
"< br / > < br / > Two women decide to pool their resources in answer to an ad for a month's rental of a villa in Italy. Due to financial circumstances, two other women join them. Had a bad day? A delightfully uplifting movie! This also changes the people in their lives who have visited them.",1
"Wheel out the cripple! "" Fo sho, yo! I cried. A smart man. He changes completely, with each character he takes on. Human. He has a lot of screen time here. And his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. No.",1
Probably a man too for that matter. In fact off the scene his role wasn't even over.,1
Worth watching for outstanding performances.,1
"Outstanding! He learns to speak later in the film, it is very good for a guy like him.",1
Playing anyone with such serious physical impairments has to be a demanding task. < br / > < br / > Day - Lewis is the easiest to highlight. < br / > < br / > Equally important but through more subtle means is Sheridan's work on the film. This story is about day - to - day life and struggles. Those are the most commendable performances.,1
"< br / > < br / > If you haven't seen it, you should see it. I love it. I watched this film in shire joy. < br / > < br / > Daniel Day - Lewis'performance is incredible.",1
"Also, it's just so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so don't miss this one.",1
this guy wrote with his foot. This movie tells people something. not fastest runner? but they were lucky. Then i saw this film.,1
"It deserves to live forever. """,1
"Truly magnificent, outstanding, superlative. ( If you see this on DVD, enable that option. ) What an emotional experience - - I feel drained and uplifted. ( See Christy Brown in Wikipedia for more accuracy. ) I've just returned from a showing of "" My Left Foot "" at our public library.",1
"Brenda Fricker is the surprise wonder in it, though.",1
"You'll cry your heart out, but you'll experience a wonderful catharsis! Go and see it!",1
"Really a career taint for him, what pity! So lucky for Christy!",1
"Very, very tough.",1
"Brown was born in 1931, one of the thirteen children of a working - class Dublin family. My view, however, is that the majority of these awards were well deserved. Matlin, who played a deaf woman, is herself deaf, but all the others are able - bodied. He was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well.",1
"He falls in love with her. Walking into pub, he announces, "" My son's a genius. "" One of the nicest parts of the film is the relaxed way the in which the other children treat him. Christy doesn't talk back.",1
My left foot is a powerful outstanding film. Jim Shirdan is to me one of the greatest directors in the world.,1
"Both Fricker and Day - Lewis won Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. There's a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love to her before others and then goes into a frenzied rage after drinking too much. < br / > < br / > Summing up : Elmer Bernstein's music is She complements Day - Lewis'performance as the warm - hearted mother and shares many poignant moments with him. < br / > < br / > The film, however, is a very difficult one to review - - or even watch.",1
A great movie in every sense.,1
"I do recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie - lovers.",1
"Then, suddenly, all of us stopped talking and laughing. The TV was on - there was a movie which we did not pay much attention to.",1
"Most highly recommended. By no means a complete portrait, but fine examples of the disabled as human beings.",1
Although I give this movie 4.,1
This movie is a real winner!,1
! Mary - Kate and Ashley were robbed at Oscar time!!,1
Be sure and rent!! : ),1
I think that this movie was reasonbaly good.,1
"However film for me is captivating because of her performance, besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities.",1
"The French adored her and she became a huge celebrity. There he encounters a vivacious & talented Bedouin girl, living in poverty.",1
"Then film would be much, much better.",1
It´s just awesome!,1
Also Jackie's stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film. POLICE STORY mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds.,1
com for 14 : 98. OUCH! Buy it at amazon.,1
The acting isn't too bad and the plot is pretty good. In my opinion Police Story is Chan's best film from the 80's. I have not seen the protector so I cant compare.,1
"Due to this, he became wanted by the police. Everyone should watch it. Highly recommended.",1
"The human interest aspect showing interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show. ). My wife, Kate and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one ( hopefully there is a sequel!",1
Althou I think they could put more fighting scenes in this film.,1
"To be fair, he's now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown. We don't watch Jackie Chan films for story. < br / > < br / > Enter'Police Story '.",1
"The standout out directing of the film comes with the fight scenes. None of the performances in this film is of a low enough standard to affect the quality of the film. In the middle of the film is yet another standout sequence as Jackie tries to transport Bridgete Lin from her house to his. But the plot of the film is Jackie Chan, who plays a nice guy cop, struggling to convict the local gang lord.",1
"Police Story is one of Jackie Chan's classic films that helped shape the Hong Kong cinema. It is a masterpiece that should not be missed by any action movie fan. Many people were hospitalized in Police Story including Jackie Chan. Even today, no movie has outdone police story in dangerous stunts. Both the action and the stunts are extremely realistic and innovative.",1
Jackie rules!! !,1
This movie never let you down. Jackie Chan name is synonomus to stunts.,1
"Bones were broken and blood spilt in the process of making this film as you'll see in the credits. I must say that english version has some dodgy dubbing, but it shouldn't put you off too much. By the way, the film was nicknamed'Glass Story'by the stunt crew. This is Jackie Chan's best film, and my personal favourite. !",1
"By the end of this movie, you can tell he held absolutely nothing back and neither did his stuntmen. All in all, one of his greatest stunts he ever did and left him with skin pealed off his hands. The last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone - period. Jackie is at his absolute best here. It is truly sensational. < br / > < br / > All in all, another Chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movies.",1
).,1
All in All I thought it was a great movie. I loved so much. Wondering what the secret Alicia is hiding. It keeps you wanting to see more.,1
Police Story is a stunning series of set pieces for Jackie Chan to show his unique talents and bravery. In serious confines of some elements of Police Story it just doesn't work for me. I always prefer JC in films such as Project A where his natural comic talents shine through.,1
Police story brought Hong Kong movies to modern day cinema.,1
"It's one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen. Its place is in top 10 among action / comedy jewels. Here there's a lot of this stuff. ). Jackie is menacing and psychotic here. Every time it goes "" crack! < br / > < br / > All three movies are great.",1
"He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park, and even in TODAYS movies. a masterpiece",1
"It's two hours of pure entertainment, that impresses all the way through.",1
"If New Line Cinema has any sense, they would release this theaters.",1
"In his role as director, Chan exceeds in excellence, giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action.",1
"If Enter The Dragon bared the so - called bench mark of Lee's greatness in the 70s, then the same can be said about Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 80s. Especially as he has the bruises to show for it. < br / > < br / > The stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best featured in any action movie.",1
"The latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their Chinese originals. It'll never get you thinking, but what entertaining, and well strung - together, film. Probably Jackie Chan's best film in the 1980s, and the one that put him on the map. The action is superb from beginning to end, and there's not much time to breathe in between. Arguably, this is one of the best martial arts films out there.",1
"The three are portrayed sympathetically, warts and all. The story lines have been interesting, if rather heavily dependent on wonders of DNA - testing. Widower James Bolam cannot come to terms with his wife's untimely death.",1
"). "", "" never heard of him "". the film still grabs me like no other. Hmmmm, Police Story, looks interesting "", "" who is this Jackie Chan?",1
"Two weeks later, after SBS had shown the'Police Story'trilogy, I knew I had found my new favourite actor. Everything in between is great. < br / > < br / >'Police Story'is one of Jackie's finest works. One night I noticed in the TV guide that a movie starring Jackie Chan -'Police Story'would be on later. It starts off strong, and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed. Version : Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release. Things go bad - reaaaal bad - when Chu's case is dismissed and he decides he wants Fong and Chan dead.",1
You'll laugh out loud just like I did.,1
"This movie has one of the cheesiest plots I have seen. For me, that's what makes it so awesome! I think some better work could have come out of.",1
This movie is ridiculous! They were!,1
I think that people are under estimating this incredible film.,1
"The title of this film is taken from a party game called "" Seven Minutes in Heaven. "" The couple who admitted to doing the most would be the winners of the game.",1
!,1
The characters are interesting and well - developed. Many times. What a sweet movie!,1
< br / > < br / > It's your basic'who done it?,1
"She replies ( wrongly ) "" oral sex "".",1
These characters really do care about each other. It's a great film to show to kids who are reaching pre - teen adolescence.,1
"Despite its rather salacious title, this is a light teen dramedy. Is it just me or did most of the young males look an awful lot alike? Unless you're an old coot, you'll probably find it likeable.",1
"= P ) Oh, and I liked the song that ran in the credits. Would make a good screen shot, though. ( I do NOT like Penny. ) ). Then there was Claw ( his voice was awful, though ) and the Madcat ; I thought they were done fairly good too. What's up with that? Believe it or not, Inspector Gadget's Last Case is what got me hooked on the whole Gadget thing. < br / > < br / > Talking cars? And, apparently, Gadget loved his car more than would be called natural.",1
Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most surprising and delightful film I've seen all year.,1
Shakespeare Behind Bars was a strangely uplifting documentary despite its content. Hal is the same at the beginning of the film.,1
One inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins. the casting. At least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events. Prison life too is much like that.,1
"Every year a group of inmates present a Shakespearean play. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years. O brave new world, that has such creatures in it. "" Only a handful get any recognizable distribution.",1
"How many of us have the courage to do this? 'Shakespeare Behind Bars'is. 'Oz'is not real, television is not real. I was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts being poured out on screen. They should be commended without end for this work. I was at the inmate screening.",1
"There are many on the Palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come. You know something tragic is going to happen and, of course, it does. This is the second Eytan Fox film I have seen. It is in no one's interest to end this war, and children suffer. There is no superficiality. < br / > < br / > But, that's the rub. It won't go away.",1
"Well, not really. It just doesn't happen to be the two gay guys for a change. There are cartoonish characters in this movie. Movies like this one, and C. R. A. It is so refreshing. Their relationship is complicated by the tension between the Jews and Arabs in Israel.",1
If you follow this film's dialogue attentively enough then you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending. < br / > < br / > The English subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and appreciate world cinema at its best. Romance soon blooms but in that political climate opportunities would have to be seized quickly or lost altogether.,1
"A good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment. If you're not heartless, you'll cry through the last third of the movie.",1
The situation is bleak enough. To be gay is accepted in Tel Aviv. The lovers are one from Tel Aviv et the other from Nablus. The funeral follows the wedding. Bad enough. Ashraf volunteers to take his place. It is off limits in Nablus. The vengeance reunites the two lovers in death.,1
"and his two co - tenants, a guy and a girl, chose to live. These reasons, in my opinion, are sufficient to consider Fox a noteworthy director, even when his feeling for the melodrama is a tad out of control. Still it won't be easy for Noam and his friends, ' The two guys are gay and along with the girl they have established a trio in which they brotherly love and support each other.",1
"The title of the film refers to the bubble "" that is Tel - Aviv set against the background of the political realities of Israel. Yelli and Noam naturally don't object to participating in these. It doesn't have much in common with the tense and hateful atmosphere at the Palestinian checkpoints. The Israeli filmmaker Eytan Fox'latest film The Bubble "" is about that. And then it is also not. Actually, it doesn't seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it.",1
"In an attempt to rescue Ashraf from his fate, Noam and Lulu disguise themselves as French reporters to gain access to Ashraf. All goes well until Ashraf must return home for his sister's wedding. It is a window into a situation that begs for understanding. It is during one of these guard duty weekends that he meets a young Palestinian named Ashraf ( Yousef'Joe'Sweid ), and a mutual attraction occurs. < br / > < br / > While the young people in Tel Aviv are dancing at an event to raise attention for peaceful coexistence, an attack occurs in",1
"! The dilemma, the emotions entailed.",1
It is worth seeing several times.,1
"So many fine things to see. Talk about a dramatic "" end game! """,1
how ironic ) and... he cried in the end!!!,1
Eytan Fox did it again : move the viewer's heart in a modest story taking place in an overwhelming mess. < br / > < br / > Nota Bene : There is central gay plot in the movie. ( and don't worry : the chick is hot too! ),1
"The reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point. Well, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. < br / > < br / > The central theme is that revenge begets more revenge, which begets even more, in an ever - expanding bloodbath. ( He also seemed to think that Ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem, which tells me he wasn't paying attention when Ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered. ) Where does it end? If only it was that easy.",1
"Most importantly, Tel Aviv serves as a character of its own in this film. The love is incredibly strong, and stands as the centerpiece of the film. Yet, this is an important element of this film's strength. It is constantly referenced.",1
"actors. Pointless plot points. < br / > < br / > It achieves exactly what it was designed to. Excruciatingly bad ( Downs - Syndrome! ) After "" What Is It? "" Terribly heavy self important dialog. Scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat. He supposedly blew up at the info.",1
"The way you get in to his mindset is really something. It is fine! I have seen it twice and it seems Glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to he wants to accomplish. See that also. This is an intelligent films. If you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books, that is also very wroth while.",1
I didn't know what to make of this film. I guess that is what it was all about really.,1
"In either guise, you sense the tremor that this film will ultimately cause. It will never be accepted, not even by the supposed auteurs of the world who boringly speak about the human condition. Crispin Glover, in all of his "" out there "" antics and predispositions, truly made something that is unique. You may not like it but it is certainly something worth watching.",1
"Rather one "" WHAT IS IT? "" I only wish i could remember every detail. screening )... It haunts me sometimes. Hilarious, evocative, confusing, brilliant film.",1
"is an endearing and compelling film in ways one hardly expects while viewing. does similarly with imagery drawn from Western culture. < br / > < br / > What Is It? < br / > < br / > You get the sense that Glover doesn't mind that this is the case, and he'll almost as gladly listen to why someone hated the film as to why they enjoyed it.",1
Her eyes are the mirror to his soul - - and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are.,1
High quality realistic story and movie.,1
"What are they? "" < br / > < br / > Ustinov searches out that crummy loft in Paris. Ustinov : "" Little female donkeys. "" It's covered with cobwebs. Smith : "" Assets?",1
"This should mean that eventually these stocks she bought were worthless. Anyway, he comes up with a scheme to impersonate a computer expert and obtain a job with a large American corporation so he can eventually embezzle a ton of cash. Yeah, right. But, it's a movie after all, so I was able to suspend disbelief. Peter Ustinov plays an embezzler who is just getting out of prison when the film begins.",1
A swinging good time! Malden has seldom been so loose. This is a heist film with a lot of brains.,1
Hot Millions is a great movie in every way.,1
"Don't miss this movie, set in'60s London. It's worth if it only to hear Maggie Smith whine, "" I've been sacked. "" Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a crook.",1
Well worth seeing.,1
"Allowing them a bit of artistic license, I don't think their efforts had any flaws worthy of note. I can only echo the praise of the other reviews here. Naturally sweet - no added sugar. < br / > < br / > CD",1
I say almost. Ustinov creates a clever and divisive plot that has him cleverly going from two bit con man to ingenious... Well you'll see. I just saw Hot Millions on TCM and I had completely forgotten this gem.,1
Now only problem is trying to find it on DVD so I can watch it more often.,1
"Cesar Romero appears also in a cameo role as an airport customs inspector. Marcus, who is a genius at numbers, sees opportunities where others wouldn't. < br / > < br / > The best thing in the film is Peter Ustinov.",1
!,1
The ending is funny and nicely cynical.,1
"To tell you how would spoil this very funny, romantic, intelligent, and ahead - of - its - time picture. It gets better every time I see it.",1
"Even if it is a ta ( tongue in cheek ) implausible, even unbelievable, the characters are not. If it was on tomorrow I'd watch it again. Not forgetting others in minor roles.",1
I would never want to know anyone well who didn't love this movie.,1
Brilliant movie! I think I will now go on to read the novel.,1
< br / > < br / > What do I particularly like about this film?,1
< br > < br / > Make sure to catch this one at your local art - house. Kudos to the writers of this film for creating a supremely engaging drama.,1
Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it!,1
That made it very engaging. I suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not force feeding their characters.,1
ANSWER : TOO MANY!,1
This film deserves a wide audience.,1
"I just realized, Judd Hirsch was in that, too!",1
"Anyway, I found the film refreshing and entertaining. Judd is fantastic as usual ; as are Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise though is Elliot Korte who plays Adam Groden. The shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward.",1
< br / > < br / > This is gem and I would whole heartedly recommend it ( I'm sure it will make it to screen ).,1
Story builds in interest and complexity. ). LOVED IT!,1
"< br / > < br / > I have nothing more to say, but to suggest this film to anyone. Watson also performs brilliantly. Through those, complex character of Luzhin is described. This film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best.",1
). LOVED IT!,1
"Overall, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers. Can't be coincidence.",1
"Robert says that he too needs to experience men. She runs away with his keys. Robert praises Martin's work, much more than it deserves, promises to get Cacophony ensues.

Have you ever wondered why? < br / > < br > This is by far my favorite film of all time. The other cast members do a fine job as well.,1
< br / > < br / > Then suddenly he leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door. It flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory. Her performance is forceful and complex.,1
"I loved it, too.",1
"This should be required watching for anybody, but especially schools. It should be re - released. I agree whole - heartedly with the comments so far.",1
"He is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums. Thinking Alexander reached his peak, abandons him but becomes legend.

Throughout the film he is'on '.,1
"Although critically maligned, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Highly recommended.",1
"But that's the point, right? < br / > < br / > 7 out of 10. < br / > < br / > The cast is likable ; Michael Keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed.",1
Another great scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope.,1
What ever happened to Michael Keaton? This movie is actually FUNNY!,1
< br / > < br / > one particular quote in the movie stands out.,1
"Johnny uses the last name "" Dangerously "" in the mobster world. What makes it funny is that he does it all with an angry face. As Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Michael Keaton is "" Johnny Dangerously "" in this take - off on gangster movies done in 1984.",1
Motives weren't very much outlined either.,1
"Meanwhile Deanna attempts to help Alicia to see some of the softness and light in the world again. Ryan pays respect to a situation he has never endured and attempts to delve into the human psyche. Despite its low - budget and short filming time, this movie is far from cheesy.",1
"Sure it's not perfect, some gags fall bit short, but no movie is perfect, especially when considering other opinions that yours. Sometimes gags need more culture than a lot of people imagine to be understood correctly, if at all. If you don't like humorous flicks, don't watch them! That is why I rated this movie 9 out of 10. I could not believe the low 5. Which are nowadays more and more absurd while cutting down on the thought and ingeniosity side.",1
"What else is there to say? < br / > < br / > This character really brings out the moron in Moronie. "" Roman Troy Moronie "" is my comment on the movie.",1
"This time, Amy ( "" Fast Times at Ridgement High "" ) Heckerling tries her hand, with an amazing amount of television writers behind the script ( go and check ). But there were several pretenders to the throne. I know I was. And they have to reload a little too often. < br / > < br / > Eight stars. Check out "" Johnny Dangerously ""... don < br / > < br / > And the jokes?",1
It's worth a look. This movie is utterly hilarious.,1
This movie is just a lot of fun.,1
Keaton is brilliant in this - as in most of his work. < br / > < br / > I gave it a 7.,1
Looking for a movie to cheer you up?,1
"And he does it well. It does work. But I suggest to give it a chance. "". Like, I said give it a chance. You have "" Johnny Dangerously "".",1
"I love part when they're in the ever - changing getaway car! Look in the background of every scene. Yes, Keaton looks like he really did enjoy making this film. Marilu Henner has a nice singing / dancing routine while Johnny revels in it. See this one for 1930's gangster laughs!",1
"Them, too. Watch the greatest "" warning against sex "" educational film ever made. Okay - I'll confess. Some come close, but none of them are quite this good. This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do.",1
"As far as parody films go, there are few that are worth time and energy. < br / > < br / > Not perfect by a long shot, but definitely good for smile on a bad day.",1
"< br / > < br / > recommend it to a friend. Even actors with minor roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale get in a good lines. Oh, what fun there is here! Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner given good lines.",1

I am so glad we found it here! We will be recommending it to our friends. This movie is why I found this website.,1

"it's not possible. < br / > < br / > enjoy. 7 / 10. despite his best efforts, higher authority tells him his day is over.",1
"And their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s. This movie's origins are a mystery to me, as I only know as much as IMDB did before I rented it. In any event, they should have left it unrated if you're trying to sell it in the suspense / softcore porn section. The quick cuts, cheesy "" Melrose Place "" music, and short 2 - second close - up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you're in for. Would I watch this TV show? No.",1
but found the movie remarkably entertaining. I suggest it to anyone who loves the acting biz.,1
< br / > < br / > I highly recommend'Break a Leg '.,1
"A struggling actor finds the best way to break into Hollywood is to start knocking off the competition. Cassini is an actor's actor, and the role really shows off his talents. The writing is tight, the dialogue first rate.",1
But I love it!,1
This is definitely one of Jet's best efforts.,1
I can't explain it ( well maybe a little tequila ). Think Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.,1
"This is one of Li's best films, go out and see on May 14 when it is released in America. This film screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go. Once again Jet Li brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the film Black Mask.",1
I am a massive fan of Jet Li!,1
Not in Black Mask.,1
I love martial arts movies that are a spectical. But still all around a great high paced action movie.,1
Thanks! Li is excellent as the low key librarian / cop who saves all time and time again.,1
"What is it? I watched a lot of Hong Kong flix in the 1990's and loved the era dearly. For me, this makes watching movies, all more fun and dangerous.",1
"< br / > < br / > Now let's talk about the original HK release. What more could I say? The Americans totally hated it because the U. S. cut was so bad, although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it. Yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child, but it works. Anyway, there are a lot of things to like about movie.",1
I only saw the wires in two shots.,1
This is a very strange HK film in many ways.,1
Fist of Legend would have been a much better choice.,1
"< br / > < br / > This film is a Chinese comic book movie. The guy who has a time - bomb sewn to his heart - outrageous? of course, it's a joke!",1
And the fight scenes are somethin. Recommended.,1
I gave a 7.,1
"But this movie I enjoyed, mostly because I'm used to the usual HK action films. That is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped. And mindless action is right. < br / > < br / > My rating was an 8.",1
< br / > < br / > The settings in Italy and Hungary are beautiful.,1
"In this film he comes across as a martial arts God. < br / > < br / > Jet Li is a marvel. They are great together. It is a pointless comparison seeing that Lee is dead, but it is a fun one. But to be honest. Lots and lots of gory mindless action. You will love this film. And that is what makes watching him so fun. My friends and I often discuss who would win a fight too.",1
And that made me a happy camper. Haven't any of you seen Cradle 2 The Grave? ) What the crap were you expecting from a Jet Li movie? Duh!,1
"All of them are suspect. A young couple on their honeymoon. One of them is an alien, but which one? < br / > < br / > Oops. ( Things must be pretty bad back on Mars. )",1
"It's not the most profound episode, there's no great meaning or message. But it's a lot of fun, and there are some fine performances. The Zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story.",1
< br / > < br / > A friendly guy. One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes.,1
"A bus full of passengers is stuck during a snow storm. However, it's also very and watchable, so who cares?! Exactly WHAT occurs you'll just have to see for yourself.",1
My vote is eight. However the driver tells that he had only six passengers when he parked the bus.,1
Well I gave this movie a 7.,1
I'm sure Zack could have coped. 10 / 10 The humour supplements it nicely.,1
"Probably my third favourite of four movies, but in no means bad at all.",1
"Only the PhD plays the zombie. The truck driver is a a ringer for real truck drivers. As a scientific exercise with philosophical underpinning it is fascinating. The girl, although overacting a bit, looks suitable dumb. But the minute when the chips are down, he falls back on his faith.",1
But it is very well acted. < br / > < br / > His performance is probably the best in history.,1
"Besides, Pierre Fresnay is sublime.",1
"Do you carry away men too? "" That would be too much work "" is the smart answer. < br / > < br / > In next scene, dialoque between Morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable. "" < br / > < br / > I think that "" Le défro asks Morand, who hates himself for what he has just done. """,1
It has a good storyline and plot.,1
!,1
The story is not so consistence but good enough. Zillion Times Better Than Expected. < br / > < br / > Rating : 7.,1
"All in all, most of the film goes down very easily. So, there is more.",1
Why did they discontinue it? Aloha! The only show I have watched since 90210!,1
I thought the plot sounded contrived and I was afraid that the story would be banal. 9. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! But being a David Lynch fan I decided to give it a go.,1
Lovely piece of good cinema.,1
"Way to go, Dave.",1
"It's the only way to watch this very good movie, which rates a 7 / 10 in my book. If it's action and adventure you want in a movie, then you'd be best advised to look elsewhere. < br / > < br / > Stretch out on couch, relax and enjoy.",1
"The movie kept my interest so much that I didn't even know sun was about to rise. By the end, you feel like you've known him your whole life.",1
But that's vintage Lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best. Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch's works is his most accessible.,1
"Its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep, but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in end.",1
"Grade : A On paper, this movie would sound incredibly boring. It's a slow, simple, relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we've lost with urbanization of America. Alvin tells her a story about his own kids, long ago. That bundle, "" he said, "" is family. """,1
A major example of this is the chess legend Bobby Fischer. Hi all I am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6. youtube. com / watch?,1
A must see. Always fancied this film from the video cover.,1
"Lyle and Alvin don't even have to say anything. Everyone who has a sibling can relate to it. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful flick.",1
But that's just the basic synapsis... this movie is about so much more than that.,1
"It is slow and even, sweet and moving.",1
That would be crafty. It is a simple film but it is indeed a great film. Look carefully for those small details that Lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment. < br / > < br / > The pace of the film is slow. But maybe that IS Lynch.,1
"< br / > < br / > The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch film. Alvin declines with thanks. The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Not that there's anything typical about them anyway. It's an odyssey through rural America. Perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator. He rode 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt.",1
"I eagerly anticipate seeing it again, and again. Directed by David Lynch, this films proves his directorial skill. The music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen.",1
"< br / > < br / > This film is the story of a journey. < br / > < br / > Along the way, Alvin meets many people. His objective is very simple and straightforward. And at the end of film, we know who we are.. better.",1
"He argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse. For many Lynch devotees this was a huge negative point. Brundage claims, with his protagonist Alvin Straight "" quoting lines directly from Confucious. "" Yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film. < br / > < br / > The Straight Story was the first feature which Lynch directed where he had no hand at writing.",1
"I certainly didn't. I thought I knew what to expect : one of the most boring experiences of my life. Who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother, could possibly be good cinema? But why should you watch it then?",1
"However it is in a light that I have not witnessed from Lynch before. After seeing this film I feel like I know just a little bit more about the USA. If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, don't look here.",1
Rarely has modern film preached so positively about family.,1
"THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one. < br / > < br / > I needn't have worried. Instead, they depend on story to build its own power, and it does, so by the final scene, we are genuinely moved.",1
"< br / > < br / > Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. Count me as one of the latter, and I own all three of those "" dark "" films, too. The wrinkles on his face tell many a story. "" I think it's a hidden gem. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life year after this film was released.",1
"It's a loving story about family, friendship, and kindness of strangers. I would highly recommend it. As much as the film is G - rated, it's pure Lynch in style, pacing, and tone. < br / > < br / >'Straight Story'is to me one of the most moving motion pictures I've ever seen.",1
"Not excessive sentimental. ). You must see it! """,1
"Perhaps more than many films, this one is not for everyone. No simple task, that.",1
"Not a single square of space is wasted. Or, is she transmuted to the king? < br / > < br / > This is a magnificent movie ( 10 / 10 ). < br / > < br / > So many brilliant scenes abound, I cannot recount them all. The period, the costumes, and imagery of early 20th century Italy's lake district is captured magnificently. The true story here is that games are zero - sum ; there is a winner and a loser, unless both contestants draw.",1
its very underrated.,1
These I got. What I wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence.,1
"Sometimes the characters are on earth, from elsewhere, while the story at first implies at least one is an "" Earthling. "" < br / > < br / > * Minor "" spoiler. "" - - as did this episode.",1
"Despite their many flaws as rulers, Victoria and Albert were some of the first leaders devoted to improving civilization for their people. It's hard to find an outright bad historical drama that's based on the life of any number of British monarchs. But these things are only briefly hinted at during the film. < br / > < br / > But we don't get to see that love enough.",1
"< br / > < br / > To me the film feels like unfinished. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable. Maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script, i don't know but that's how i feel about movie. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne although i expected more of him.",1
"The set design and costumes are outstanding. She portrays Victoria in her youth, ascension to the throne, and early years. Heartily recommend. < br / > < br / > Grade : Blunt's Victoria both fresh and restrained throughout the film.",1
"Not only is the history correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. I really thought that this movie was superb.",1
But once Victoria ( Emily Blunt ) comes of age and is courted by Prince Albert ( Rupert Friend ) the film blooms. A solid if not transporting epic.,1
"). Jean Marc Vallee ( C. R. A. With all of the films of recent, dealing with the British Monarchy, is it really time for another?",1
"( The flashbacks are beautifully lit, by the way. ) It's stunning. < br / > < br / > * * * * Possible Spoilers * * * * Be Forewarned! Listen closely to that description. So many people have seen this film and just don't get it, and I don't understand why.",1
"< br / > < br / > "" The Young Victoria "" is not She shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years. The Young Victoria "" dramatizes the tumultuous transition of the young woman into power. In here, she is given the breakout role of her career, a real life historical figure, who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time. Luckily for Victoria, there is Albert, a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate. She also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes.",1
"Who knew? As a result, the Duchess attempted to limit Victoria's contact with King. < br / > < br / > The Act I'set - up'draws you in right away. What's more, Victoria was forced to sleep in her mother's bedroom everyday until she became Queen. 'The Young Victoria'not only chronicles the young Queen's romance with her husband - to - be but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the throne. < br / > < br / > King William kept his word and died a short time after Victoria became eligible to accede to the throne.",1
"< br / > < br / > All in all I have spent worse times at the cinema, and brownie points with my wife can't be bad thing either. It is quite likely that this relationship was the true reason for Victoria's distaste for both her mother and Conroy. All of this is well borne out in the film. She was a bright intelligent and according to the history of her early years, a fun loving happy young woman.",1
"Shortly after she succeeded to the throne she came under the influence of her Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to the extent that she became known as "" Mrs Melbourne "". The Young Victoria "" is a beautifully photographed, brilliantly - scored and very sumptuous movie. Lord Melbourne cuts a dash in the Old Public School Man kind of way with his finely - honed cynicism and his well - polished gems of advice. At first a reluctant suitor, he soon falls in love with the English queen and palliates the influence of the politicians and courtiers. "" It is Queen Victoria's misfortune to be defined as an historical figure according to her relationships with men. Such is the price women paid in a patriarchal society. Courts have always been hotbeds of seething jealousy, plotting and counter - plotting, naked ambition and sometimes, outright murder. Into the arena rides Prince Albert, on a mission from King Leopold of Belgium, keen on political rapprochement between Great Britain and the rest of Europe.",1
Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria. ( Think Blackadder ).,1
"I just loved it, all of it! That pretty good! imdb. PFCS for Best Costume design. ( Oscar and BAFTA wining Sandy Powell, for costume design. VFCC for Best Actress, Emily Blunt. ) Overall 10 wins 11 nominations! http : / / www.",1
i. e. Did Princess Victoria really stuff an entire truffle / rissole (? ) Enjoyed the movie very much. There is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at?,1
"She was treated so badly by her mothers adviser Sir John Conroy, because he wanted Britain to have a regency. The films wipes away the "" I am not amused "" impression of Queen Victoria and shows she was a cheerful young woman. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!! The Young Victoria is a heart felt love story but at the same time a great look into major part of British History... I was a little worried that it wouldn't be historically accurate, but it was and I loved it. This was what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic Queen, which she was!",1
"And I say "" unexpectedly "" because I usually don't pay too much attention to those details. I hope more period films follow the example of this movie : the costumes and the landscapes should work as the support of an interesting story, and not as the replacement of it. < br / > < br / > I liked The Young Victoria very much, and I really took a very nice surprise with it.",1
"The rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well, Harriet Walter as Queen Adelaide being a highlight. It was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth. If I was Blunt I would have trouble parting with any of them!",1
This is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great.,1
"The facts of her life are not the Sturm und Drag such as powerful dramas are made of. What more can be said? < br / > < br / > Simply put if you are looking for high passion, compelling drama, and Machiavellian intrigue, this is not the movie for you. I have not been this fascinated with a young actress since Cate Blanchett burst upon the scene over ten years ago. Thus, central to the film is the budding love of Victoria and her Prince Albert.",1
"The acting and scenes were captivating, highly emotional. "", lol. Good performances all around! It had a well written screenplay and flawless editing.",1
"As she was in that film, she is once again the standout here. Needless to say, it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing. Facing an over - bearing mother? Not enough can be said about Emily Blunt in this role. The other actors in the film are also very good. I was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young Victoria, and thought she handled the role very well. Having others taste your food before you eat it?",1
"I'm just saying. To see the old Victoria, check out Mrs Brown. It is a tricky thing to play a queen.",1
"More contemporary stories would include Helen Mirren's award winning portrayal of The Queen on the current reign of Queen Elizabeth II at the turn of Princess Diana's death. < br / > < br / > That's not to say The Young Victoria is without. On one hand you'd understand the need for a young, and new Queen to have trusted people in key positions, but on the other, are they really acting in her interests, or in the interests of others?",1
"First, she must surround herself with the "" right "" advisers to govern wisely. Once he arrives at the palace, he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual. ), and the rest. Princess Victoria ( Emily Blunt ) is in line for the throne of England. It is another sign that Victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country. Which brings us to the young queen's second major decision. The young lady refuses, despite John slapping her around.",1
I was the most amazed by thoughtful cinematography.,1
< br / > < br / > BRAVO : 9 out of 10! and She probably will get a nomination at this years Oscar's.,1
It may no have been her fault but her prince deserved crown. He is superb. An act of love.,1
"Vallée takes this and runs, making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching. The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history. Everything from the costume designs, sets, hair styles, lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to Victoria's story without ever over - encumbering it.",1
It's a love story with a twist. ( Italy's lake district in the twenties. ),1
"It is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes.",1
"< br / > < br / > Visually the film is stunning. < br / > < br / > In a word, it was great!",1
"The Young Victoria "" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. < br / > < br / > There are three main strands to the plot. ( According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father ).",1
News of the revolution reach the secluded Siberian village through the grapevine. Konchalovsky celebrates Soviet collectivity but in an almost revisionist way to paeans like Soy Cuba and Invincible the mood turns somber and reflective.,1
"< br / > < br / > This film is long and slow, but utterly logic and very well made. He later joins the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village. It can be seen in three parts. His son, by the local beauty, fights the Germans during Second World War.",1
It is much more better than Doctor Zhivago.,1
"I would prefer "" Kurochka Ryaba "" to them... I was impressed first, by the script and then, by the realization of this script.",1
"By far! Way better then Bertolucci's "" 1900 "".",1
"I was VERY impressed with the mixture of drama, suspense & comedy.",1
i wish that a video was available in Britain.,1
There is no comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly.,1
"Personally, I love Askey, perhaps it's because I go into his world, rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine, which is a mistake too many people make.",1
"5 to. The fact is ; as already stated, it's a great deal of fun. Wonderfully atmospheric.",1
I am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by Arnold Ridley ( Private Godfrey in dad's army ). I thank you Hello Playmates.,1
"; for the remake under review, the plot has been updated to the then - current wartime situation.",1
"Years later, I watch it every now and again, enjoying the familiarity. The atmosphere is truly as near sinister as an Arthur Askey vehicle could get. This is available cheap as chips in the UK on DVD so treat yourself. but full of wonderful character performances - including Kathleen Harrison as a dotty spinster. I Thank You.... < br / > < br / > OLD MOVIES CANE GOOD MOVIES! There is much to enjoy.",1
If he was playing an annoying little man as part of the script then he succeeded. I suppose different tastes in different times but clowning around became tiresome.,1
His humour is innocent and childish which makes it sweet to watch. The Ghost Train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940's humour.,1
"Then, too, the ending is bittersweet. Sascha, too, is taken with Natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting. This is a lovely film, based on a novel by Nabokov. Oh, and can he become the chess champion, also?",1
It's set in old rural England during the second world war. You though are at home. < br / > < br / > The Ghost Train is a genuine British war time classic! Get hold of some ginger nuts and sit down in front of the DVD. < br / > < br / > I will tell you!,1
His repartee with everyone falls between side - splitting and ghastly dull.,1
"It keeps you hooked from the moment the movie starts till it finishes. They are not dated to me though. < br / > < br / > The set pieces in the movie are very atmospheric. It is an escape from reality for a while. I still have a lot of appreciation for some of the old movies of this kind. This man was in the Will Hay classic "" The Ghost of St Michaels "" as well.",1
This is probably best of Askey's movies.,1
But somehow everything keeps pointing back to Askey's Tommy Gander character.,1
No one I know can watch this movie without being at least mildly amused. The only problem with the film : Fred Astaire singing without dancing. It is on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics.,1
"Overall, I did like film quite a bit - - it had a lot of charm and excellent writing. Because of this, the usual balance and great boy - girl dialog was lacking. Only once, at the very end, does Ms. Fontaine dance with Fred but it's very brief and with a distant camera shot. They were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this department. I have never been a fan of their show or their movies.",1
"The amusement park interlude & the climax in the castle are too long & begin to drag. But while "" Damsel "" is a pretty diminutive vehicle for so much talent, the talent doesn't let us down. Her scene with solid character actor Gardiner as devious snob Keggs is a one - of - a - kind classic. The story would have been much better as a half - hour TV episode.",1
IF they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime event. The surreal fun - house sequence is marvelously staged. Young Joan Fontaine was cast in this opposite Astaire. < br / > < br / > Except a leading lady.,1
"However, this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one.",1
"Surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen, including an inventive and fun romp through an amusement park. They concoct a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right. The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. < br / > < br / > Fun film, great songs, good cast, and Jan Duggan in a rare spotlight! Yikes. She was also a scene stealer in the W. C. Fields comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, playing Cleopatra Pepperday. Her facial expressions are hilarious. Fontaine does not sing, but does a brief ( and decent ) number with Astaire.",1
"The best scene is the "" Stiff Upper Lip "" number, which takes place in a fun house. I would have thought it was a double except the dancing was so lousy. < br / > < br / > Definitely worth seeing despite flaws. She's hilarious.",1
"< br / > < br / > There are a few high points. Reginald Gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie, and stops mugging like a silent actor.",1
"Not quite a blend of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough.",1
"This would not have been too difficult for Dickens. But P. G. Wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer, poking fun at the upper reaches of the British social system. FANCY ROMFORD'S HOUNDS is a title of one of his novels ). < br / > < br / > But Orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows. They served ( and still serve ) their purposes. His Psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior. His Earl of Emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in England than being... well Earl of Emsworth!",1
< br / > < br / > But...! Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels!,1
"Only the musical interludes give story the lift it needs. They join Astaire in what has to be the film's most inventive highlight. Fortunately, she went on to better things.",1
"It almost seems spontaneous. ( George was once a tap dance instructor ). Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth bearing up under the "" plot "". Their two numbers with Fred are high points of film, and worth waiting for.",1
"I gave this film 8 out of 10, reserving 10 for e. g Amadeus, and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire most recently. I like humour ( Balkan humour ), photography is an art itself, each scene is artistic to the limit. To understand it you really need to be one of Balkan.",1
"And if you don't understand, you can't enjoy it. Still my N1 remains The Shawshank Redemption!",1
' The Luzhin Defence'is a movie worthy of anyone's time.,1
The movie celebrates life.,1
It's a fun film before all. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about.,1
"'Zavet'is something completely different. It was very easy for Kusturica to make just another flying gypsies movie and get award. It is beautiful to see one big movie director to not take himself too seriously. Average western viewer would not get few references. Of course, if you want to be praised, you have to play safe. They find their own, poetic style, and then they cowardly become prisoners of it. Second reference is made to Goran Bregovic previous Kusturica's composer.",1
With his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal.,1
Another masterpiece.,1
"Surely, I recommend to everyone to see film. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Surprisingly good performance of Stribor Kusturica. Much More close - ups and less landscapes then in "" Life Is A Miracle "".",1
"It is simple, but true. The comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer. It is brutal, but gentle and makes you laugh to dead. For those who did not watch this movie - watch it.",1
"), not so much story - wise of course, but more mood - wise!",1
"I think I'll check to see what's available for them. She's almost a Madonna type, she's so beautiful! The two little child actresses are wonderful too. Kabei : Our Mother ( 2008 ) is a poetic and sublime beauty from Japan. I immediately thought : this director loves Ozu. Will they ever express their love for one another? Will he ever return from the war? A real weeper! I gave it Big soulful eyes and flawless skin.",1
It went to a young girl with very limited acting potential.,1
"< br / > < br / > The Italian sets are stunning. Similarly, Emily Watson shows the wealth of her experience ( from her outstanding background on the stage ). To reach the tortured chess master ( Turturro ) her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love. Although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author, the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting.",1
"My introduction into Yoji Yamada's cinematic world is through his famed and recent Samurai Trilogy with The Twilight Samurai, The Hidden Blade and Love and Honor. Help comes from relatives, especially on Shigeru's side, since Kabei's own dad had adopted an "" I told you so "" attitude with her choice of spouse. < br / > < br / > So begins Kabei's struggle to hold down jobs to feed her family, and the frequent, difficult meetings with her husband behind bars.",1
"Excellent film, highly recommended for all viewers.",1
"This of course makes it near impossible for anyone in the audience to get too emotionally distraught by any dramatic event. < br / > < br / > Soon after completing jury duties at the 58th Berlinale, I managed to catch Yoji Yamada's Kabei. < br / > < br / > Allow me to explain. It's a funny business, reviewing movies.",1
The theme is unusual and the script well written.,1
"The drummer, Patrick ( Ian Holm ), happily avoided the draft and enjoyed the ladies. < br / > < br / > This isn't the pontification of Steven Spielberg, but a serious movie nevertheless. And there's all that glorious old swing music!",1
"But Clio Lane was unmistakably herself - her warm visceral sound still turns my crank like few other jazz singers. maybe - who knew? ) And of course a great celebration of the life of the stage. Even though a few only appear for cameos, each one is a gem.",1
"Elizabeth is far more talented than the guitarist, and the money begins to flow in. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a newly widowed woman at loose ends. The Last of the Blond Bombshells is an entertaining bit of fluff. This sparks memories of when she was a member of an all girl swing band in London during World War II. Her playing is strictly for artistic fulfillment.",1
"When it's released, I'll buy it!",1
"And I defy anyone to second - guess ending. Everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected. I shan't, therefore, give away much more.",1
The casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters. I would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. Thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment.,1
This movie will be a favorite of mine. What a wonderful time for music and dancing! Glenn Miller's death was a terrible sadness to us.,1
I only hope it comes out on video.,1
"< br / > < br / > One afternoon after the funeral, Elizabeth finds herself in the attic of her home playing the sax she had put away. < br / > < br / > Why not? The roses that would appear on his bass drum had a special meaning that attested to his affection. ) So speaks Elizabeth ( Judi Dench ), George's widow. One is dead. But one by one Elizabeth and Patrick bring together the surviving members of the Bombshells. The rehearsals more often than not turn into off - key shambles.",1
"A case in point is the flowers that are sent by an admirer to Judi. 8 out of 10. For in the right hands, sometimes one just loves these brazen old clichés. Life should be this simple.",1
I highly recommend it.,1
"I've heard that before - where? 2 from Jazz Suite No. Ah, from Kubrick's "" Eyes Wide Shut "" ( track 2 ),'got it just as I arrived at the door. There are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings, celeste, piano, and harp. Alexandre Desplat's lyrical film score of "" The Luzhin Defence "" is complete. Yes, I went and picked up the soundtrack from Tower's. It's "" Waltz No. Beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in late 1920's. The front - end subject is the mind - game and mathematical logic of chess. What a treat!",1
This is the only film made by this director...?,1
This is a quirky movie that the Brits do so well.,1
Just wonderful film! No message.,1
"The actors deliver wonderful performances. Among the band members she finds are the ( still foxy! ) Now that George is dead, Elizabeth no longer has to practice playing sax in the attic.",1
"Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at 69 years of age. She certainly still gets my pulse going! The late Joan Sims is perfect as the band's leader, now playing bar piano at the sea - side, and June Whitfield glows as the Salvation Army trombone player. < br / > < br / > As I watched it, I was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age. All I can say is, I hope I look as good at their age!",1
"If you love jazz music, it is a must see.",1
"< br / > < br / > I love this movie, and I know I'll watch it many more times, and enjoy it more each time. "" An album of songs so old everyone thinks they're new. "" But wait, there's more. This film has the elusive combination of pace and mood that set some films apart from the opening moments. And why not? Well, OK, not really, but this movie is a winner.",1
"< br / > < br / > After the first time I saw it, I couldn't find it anywhere else. Soon into the movie, he escapes and starts making his way back to the lake. It is the BEST movie I have EVER seen in my life! I managed to find the song that the two Martin's are singing throughout the movie ( "" I'm going back, to where I come from... ).",1
"< br / > < br / > Valentinov is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to Luzhin, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him. Obsession, it seems, has no prejudice or preference ; moreover, it gives no quarter. < br / > < br / > At an Italian resort in the 1920's, Alexander Luzhin ( John Turturro ) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament, the winner of which will be the World Champion.",1
This very good movie crackles with tension.,1
"Palance's Blackie is as cold as a block of ice. For me, this film continues to be completely satisfying experience.",1
"Richard Widmark is allowed not to be a psychopath for once, and is a deeply caring, warmly loving, intense hero of the people. This film was a major feat of social realism. One of America's most brilliant film directors was without question Elia Kazan. This film features a spectacular film debut by Jack Palance, and a wonderful performance by Barbara Bel Geddes, two casting strokes of genius.",1
"The title overstates the content of this movie somewhat, which might lead to some unrealized expectations. 9 / 10 By the end, they've forged a real bond of respect for each other. All in all, an excellent piece of work. I found very little to criticize here. Kazan did a good job with that.",1
"These are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them. The plague is coming! Kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director. No thanks ) < br / > < br / > His future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot. ( um. Watching it you begin to notice how many decent, good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated.",1
- but I found it carried the plot along nicely. It's good.,1
"is simply outstanding. Zero Mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic. Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie ( Black Death? ) It turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact. City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease. < br / > < br / > Panic in the Streets is probably Kazan's best non - Brando film. It's tension filled, suspensefully well paced and edited.",1
"Panic in the Streets ( 1950 )'owes more to British noir that its American counterparts. < br / > < br / > In my younger years, I found Wolfgang Petersen's'Outbreak ( 1995 )'to be among most horrifying movies I'd ever seen.",1
"So, it's a race against time to find those who came in contact with the dead man and treat them immediately, otherwise a disaster could erupt. No one seemed willing to believe the doctors! ! The biggest problem is that this illness is so incredibly grotesque that in 1950 they really wouldn't have been allowed to show it. As the film opens, two thugs kill another thug. Good actors but also known actors back in 1950.",1
"Kazan's early film noir won an Oscar. It is something else, and frankly I don't know how they filmed some of it. I can almost see where they are coming from. Widmark is wonderful as usual.",1
"You know you shouldn't watch, but you can't help but look. It was like a real - life version of Melrose Place. Drama aside, there was lot of eye candy.",1
"< br / > < br / > Very well directed, and the acting is great. Black and white suits the film.",1
Catch it if you can.,1
"But my money is on the one - and - only Zero Mostel. Then too, that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration. I'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes. < br / > < br / > But it's not only the professionals that add color.",1
"Blackie brings in his own doctor and As a result, the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable. < br / > < br / > Following a dispute between the participants in a card game, a man called Kochak ( Lewis Charles ) is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area. They doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently. Poldi, however, is very ill and unable to provide any information. When the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus, U. S. Public Health official Dr Clinton Reed ( Richard Widmark ) is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague.",1
"It also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director. While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created. It's noirish elements, such as paranoia, blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being. To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema.",1
A lot ( all? ) What community?,1
"Also the music by Alfred Newman and the song by Billie Holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch. Barbara Bel Geddes, as the wife, sounds as though she's a suburban woman from Connecticut. < br / He was so intense! < br / > < br / > Mr. Kazan shot on location in New Orleans. We see a family man painting furniture with his young son.",1
I have never found out why. Too often it'just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent.,1
The cast and crew are flawless. Especially for the film - noir enthusiast.,1
"I can't really condemn the movie because it does work. Sure, the disease might be considered sinister, but I have a hard time seeing that. < br / > < br / > That lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end.",1
"Pike, Jim Kirk, etc..",1
"The standouts in the cast are the two villains. The screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down. < br / > < br / > The acting is also very good. Panic in the Streets "" is disappointing but still worth watching.",1
Kazan was a masterful director.,1
"Palance got rave reviews in first film where he received notice. < br / > < br / > Personally my favorite in this film is Zero Mostel. If there was any less it would be an Indiana Jones film. Having been to New Orleans where the story takes place I can personally attest to that. He plays the same kind of role in the Humphrey Bogart film, The Enforcer. As cop Paul Douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest.",1
Refreshing ` lost'gem! The Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence.,1
"Especially Palance impresses as the tough gangster boss, with a very powerful looking face. For fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch.",1
"The engaging plot has not become dated after fifty - seven years. My vote is seven. Jack Palance performs a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive.",1
"It's so terrific and colorful. This film predates those, but Kazan has said that he was already "" untethered "" by the studio. He wanted to exploit the environment. "" The sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked. The film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods. < br / > < br / > This is not director Elia Kazan's best work, but saying that is a bit disingenuous.",1
"Recommended, 7 / 10.",1
"Joe MacDonald, a favourite with the director, photographed Panic In The Streets'detailed environment. In fact, Widmark's previous role had been in Dassin's even finer Night And The City, a film in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent.",1
It feels like an indie film made out of a play script.,1
I have been a Star Trek fan for as long as I can remember. Watch it.,1
Also good music.,1
Some of the conflicts are not resolved. But it did not follow the standard Hollywood formula. They took some risks and did a few things different.,1
"In the end, it turns out to be a delightfully charming movie. Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized that I was enjoying this. I have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie I was basically lost. If you feel lost at the beginning, stick with this. In fact nothing very exciting happens in the entire movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > I had my doubts, because even though Freeman is great actor, sometimes he gets involved in bad projects ; this is not one of those times. This is film - making at it's simplest and it's best. The story begins by him being drop of in a supermarket in a rough neighborhood, where he meets the cashier of the 10 items or less ( Vega ) and has to take a ride with her cause "" the production "" forgot to pick him up.",1
"I recommend anyone to watch this movie as it has very good points in the film, and is really good ending. Not that much things happen in this movie but A lot of meanings.",1
"It's a difficult movie to classify "" 10 Items or Less "". < br / > < br / > I recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful admitting it's not perfect but it doesn't do anything wrong. I'm sure he wanted to achieve a product that had nothing to do with perfection : a product that would be as simple, appealing and uncompromising as its title.",1
"It is a film that is well directed and written by Brad Silberling. The editing is fair to good, but a little rough. The film strives for some honesty, and arrives at some truth, to maintain the film's integrity. Bravo!",1
The same goes for Freeman. That smile of hers can melt diamonds.,1
"It's an odd little film, probably made on a shoestring. ( That's quite an aspiration, for somebody who looks like Paz Vega. ) A nice watch. The characters are perfectly contrasted, and effective acting makes them endearing. Not a conventional character study ; they each represent entire worlds. If you don't mind slow pacing and a "" talky "" approach, this film will entertain.",1
"So, in a nutshell, while there aren't any bang!",1

"< br / > It works, even though the situation itself does seem a little inconceivable. Initially, Freeman's character just needs a lift home. And it was really good. But that's what director Brad Siberling did.",1
In real world it's the exact opposite. < br / > < br / > Make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits. The bit with a Target Store saleslady teaching Morgan Freeman how to hustle sales is just hilarious! The film had World Premiered the day before at the Elgin Theatre VISA Screening Room.,1
"She has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company, but her deep - seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already. It also helps considerably that Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are playing the characters.",1
A very rare masterpiece! It shows how a positive attitude can change anything.,1
He'just hilarious.,1
"I rarely can learn anything from movies, but this is exception. This movie is really genuine and random.",1
Grady Harp This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message.,1
I like my endings sad and my hankies dry. Is the film far fetched? You tell me.,1
"So many of his titles were big budget clichés with no heart. But I have to admit that I have often wondered about his choice of roles. I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman. In Scarlet, he sees stubborn, proud loner that he was ; he sees the man he used to be. < br / > < br / > Freeman plays an unnamed, formerly big time Hollywood actor who hasn't worked in several years.",1
"Linda Park, an outstanding ballroom dancer from Boston College, There is more military code in the cartoon STAR BLAZERS than in ENTERPRISE. With ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking disregard for rank. < br / > < br / > There is STAR TREK canon - - lots of it. Also, I did not expect to hear pure beep - based sound effects similar to TNG but far apart from TOS sound effects. Still, I liked the actors for the most part. < br / > < br / > ENTERPRISE pretty much disregards much of ST canon. An unfortunate fact for long time serious fans. From canon we know the history of the future.",1
This movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season.,1
"Together they explore, discover, and learn from each other.",1
"But it is good, it have funny parts.",1

"This movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art. < br / > < br / > The < br / > < br / > The players are not the only stars. This is what makes this movie so interesting and unique. Today's TV broadcasting style, so different than that of 1986, is still inferior in quality compared to this movie.",1

And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal.",1

The theme. We need something a little more grand. And my one other complaint. Enterprise is that show. They sell too many adds.,1
"Her devotion to him is obvious, and complete. While he blusters, Trina actually hangs tough ( if that term can be applied to a character so ladylike ). As other reviewers have noted, this is an unjustly neglected Depression - era film.",1
"The hardships of the Depression are never ignored, in fact they're integral to the film. If only more people could see it. Young's Trina is sweet and hopeful, while Tracy's Bill is gruff and closed - off. It's a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the US. It makes film warm and affectionate.",1
"But the real heroes are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close - up, and Young. It's an odd little movie, played mostly in a one - room shack in a Hooverville, unusually up - front about the Depression yet romantic and idealized.",1

"She was the only one, in one or two lines, who actually tried a southern accent. Not so well written. Hardly a masterpiece. ! Too bad.",1
It's hard to explain why. This movie is one of my very favorites.,1
all the young cast are great.,1
Jessica I love this film! Is Very romantic!,1
He played the part rather well in my opinion. Cinematography gets an above average rating also. Wow......... Do not listen to his Comments.,1
The story is original and well written.,1
It's also got a doozy of a plot twist... and a very ambiguous moral message.,1
: ),1
"I couldn't help but feel that this could have been a bigger movie than it was. SPOILER AHEAD!!!! Or did they have some sort of appearance from God? Not by changing the story - I think mainly through the cinematography. On the other hand, the pacing was absolutely on point. And I thought Bill Paxton did a great job of directing.",1
"Me and all of my friends did! Man, some of you people have got to chill. A story.",1
Paxton is not clairvoyant as other viewers suggest. It is fiction. So what?,1
"Boy, was I surprised. This is a moody movie, filled with grimness. What is message? The acting is exceptional ( Okay, I've always been a fan of Powers Booth ), and never goes over the top.",1
"This is what Voyager COULD have been. So, quit gripping enjoy. Starting with the technology. In the 35 years seince TOS premiered, the crew of Star Trek have become experts at economy.",1
There are no flaws. Each shot meticulously done!,1
"In fact, his hallucination is the primary one. It has all the trappings of a horror film but this it is not. "" Frailty "" is a film about perceptions of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong. But everything that happens to these three is rather convincing, in fact, TOO convincing. He seems trapped in his father's world of God and demons. It turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called "" God's Hands "". We see all of this unfold in front of us in a very disturbing manner.",1
"I'll waiting for more movies I "" m sure to love! ( from the movie "" Aliens "" ). Game over! """,1
"Adam, the younger, is uncomfortable, but trusts that Dad is following God's will. < br / > < br / > This is not, you understand, an abusive father. We've got to do this. "" He loves his children. He is only following God's instructions : "" This is our job now, son. And what a vision the entire family's job is to destroy demons, who, of course, are disguised in human form. Even then, I The angel was clear on this. "" The pressure that the children are under is unbearable and tragic, and warps their entire lives.",1
I had to see this. Is Dad crazy?,1
"The acting is incredible. After all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is. He's never given a first name, but that is not a weakness of the film.",1
This could be the most underrated movie of its genre. I own the DVD and it is one of my all time favorite horror - thrillers. get killed and religious experiences are questioned. I rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list.,1
This is what a real thriller movie is all about. I was totally surprised and delighted. Definite a 10 out of 10 from me.,1
"Now. The audience is left to decide. Or, is he telling the truth?",1
In A Mirror Darkly showed us what cast were capable of. Pity a film or TV movie was never considered.,1
It was beautifully shot. Bill Paxton really did a good job of directing it too.,1
The direction of Bill Paxton is remarkable. This film is highly recommended. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie.,1
It's not very scary. Well shot. It's a very good thriller.,1
Suspenseful white knuckler! Highly recommended.,1
I give this film 9 / 10 and I highly recommend that everyone catches it. Having watched the first time I was by how good it was. Bill Paxton stars in and directs this highly original film.,1
There is such rubbish on the cable movie channels that I hit a gem with this one. From beginning to end it had me gripped and deserves top marks. < br / > < br / > This film is at least as good as the likes of'Silence of the Lambs '.,1
"In any event, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script.",1
"< br / > < br / > The directors have filmed this movie very well, and they help to set the plot through the good scenery. This is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of religious murders.",1
I give this film a 9 / 10.,1
"They are seeing the universe with fresh eyes. Anyone want to start a pool on how long before the Borg show up? Okay, the recent history of Star Trek has not been good. How did we meet the Romulans? How did Klingons go from just insulting to war? They need to cut that nonsense out. So, when they announced a new Star Trek series, I did not have high expectations.",1
< br / > < br / > Solid performances from all makes this film with a message easy viewing.,1
"< br / > < br / > The film departs somewhat from the facts of Grey Owl's life. ( 46 would have been Pierce Brosnan's age when the film was made, so I am not sure why this change was made ). He lived in a cabin by a lake in a remote part of the Canadian wilderness, where he earned a living as a trapper.",1
This is an excellent movie.,1
He claimed to be a mixed blood Indian. The movie centers on this and what occurred when hoax was uncovered.,1
"I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Grey Owl?? I didn't expect much when I first saw the DVD cover.",1
We must practice what we preach!,1
"Good film, highly recommended.",1
"The heavies were OK, although I didn't like their make - up. Haven't sorted out the other males, except for the black guy. lady.",1
The movie is wonderful.,1
"The stand out scene is the return to his? Aunts? < br / > < br / > Well done Dickie Attenborough and cast. Perfect. < br / > < br / > This has to be Brosnan's best performance to date, he convinces admirably as the English boy playing Indians.",1
Now that's not something you get a lot of recently.,1
Good job to Lord Attenborough. I know some people think the movie is boring but I disagree.,1
"I give my respect. Here, on IMDb.",1
Brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does Annie Galipeau. This is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen.,1
Excellent story. The movie is more about Pony than Grey Owl.,1
series.,1
What a beautiful film. AND the extras on this DVD are something else! WOW!,1
I want to read as much as I can about him. I gave it the highest rating. I like all his movies whether he is acting or directing. But I am not surprised.,1
"The film contains a love story, a moral message, and a man tortured by his past. < br / > < br / > Thanks from proud Canadian.",1
"A good film when you need some time from the madding crowd. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau ( as Grey Owl's wife Pony ) is engaging and, if not firey, is nonetheless quite touching.",1
"That Leonardo DaVinci cartoon... "", says Dud. Originally conceived as a solo vehicle for Dudley Moore,'Not Only... The pair bounced their humour off each other in a way that was joyous to behold. Dud nearly chokes on his repast. "" You really are enjoying those sandwiches! "", ad libs Cook. B. C. - 2 insisted that he be on it every week from then on. I don't see the joke! "".",1
A disinterested look at the life of policemen. The Music.,1
Cinematography by R. D. Rajasekhar is rich. Brutal and fearsome. Anthony's editing is precise. The character suits her very well.,1
The direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious cop who. But I would still give this one 9 / 10 simply because it has many first to its credit.,1
I liked the movie so much that I had to own it. I'm really hoping that Ghajini releases soon. This one stood out for it's originality.,1
"). The gore is rather too much at times, but certainly this is great movie!",1
"As for the other cast members, a favourite of mine is John Billingsley who plays Dr. Phlox. Overall Diane Warren's theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer Russell Watson. Enterprise is ( in my opinion ) one of the most well cast shows since The Next Generation. What they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves. He simply is ( both actor wise and character wise ) a superb human being and his charm, wit, and compassion are overwhelming to watch.",1
"Great Classic film, with great Classic Actors!",1
"The film begins as Claudette Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan. What follows is amazingly intelligent and captivating. ! However, in spite of this, the film was so good, I can even excuse the limp ending.",1
"Though, the film does have it's plot holes.....",1
"A sheep is found mutilated and then a Canadian ornithologist is found slain. A quick search for the killer proves fruitless, as does a search for a missing local woman. Inskip With a heavy fog rolling in, the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help, the radio also doesn't work, seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut.",1
!,1
"Still, its a great film for the television. 8 out of 10. I just felt that Patrik Frayze looked a bit haggard.",1
Heh.,1
I have decided to buy the DVD box of the First Season and this first episode surprised me. T'Pol modifies the sensors of the Enterprise to track the Suliban spacecraft until she reaches planet Riger X. My vote is nine.,1
I loved this movie. I can not find it anywhere.,1
"Hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile. Age is inevitable, but let's not hide from it. Watched both parts twice. She didn't have the look of the woman of the 1800's.",1
It was a big screen movie and not a made for TV movie. I thought King Solomon's Mines was beautifully done. My only reservation was Alison Doody.,1
"Unfortunately, it's witless rather than witty. Nor is it a poor attempt to be so. I hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be. This story is a bit long ; much longer than its predecessors, but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and Eye Candy. 8 / Unintentional is the word. This vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the AQ / KSM saga.",1
The cinematography is splendid and score is perfect. I won't detail the differences because it would spoil the film.,1
Patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress. Elizabeth seeks out Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. < br / > < br / > The movie holds your attention until the end. Maybe a little dancing would help.,1
"It's very well shot, giving a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of Africa, and very well acted. 6 / 10.",1
"In all this is a good film from the early 30's, accept it for its age. Its also not a musical, although she does belt out one song called'The world owes me a living '.",1
"The only thing that this devoted yet dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being apart. Yikes! Even longtime Shirley fans may be surprised by "" Now and Forever. "" It is an awkward position for any movie, but this impressive, talented cast makes it work. < br / > < br / > Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard star as fun - loving, irresponsible con artists Jerry and Toni Day. But beware : You should avoid colorized version of this film, and see it in black - and - white if you can.",1
"However this is entertaining and worth watching along with LITTLE MISS MARKER. There's little music in this, and Shirley only has one song.",1
"Broken Bow "" takes us back to where it all began.",1
"I too would not have sought out this movie, but I'm sure glad I saw it. Great for those who love a good drama or tear - jerker. Very moving, very touching.",1

"don't mind the soundtrack, which is played out by now.",1
Debra Winger is beautiful!,1
"Steve asks - Hey Sissy, remember Wes? Try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly. I have dissected this movie from end to end. God I love that! No kidding.",1
This movie is a good one. It has all the heroistic characters that a young cowboy wants to be. Only America.,1
What an overlooked 80's soundtrack. I was so shocked to realize I had never watched it.,1
Everyone has their I'm sure! Bud is one who cheats on Sissy. I love him too! : ) I love this movie.,1
For that reason I love it! Few movies have hit me harder.,1
48 miles from the uncle house. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school their. i am now 21 and i enjoy watching this movie. the bar on Spencer is no longer their.,1
This movie is my favorite as well as my wife's. It looked like a 60's model.,1
This movie is an authenic look at middle America. Too bad they are all gone now.,1
The entire story was well thought out.,1
"I confess to an anti - Vinnie Barbarino bias. I did not see this film in the theater. I HAVE to stop and watch. I'm sorry John, you should have won.",1
I think it's greatest love story ever told! I own it and never get tired of Bud & Sissy.,1
"Who'd a thunk. Sort of like Clint's "" make my day. "" The soundtrack is awesome. Travolta really surprised me on the heels of SatNiteFever. Thank god it was temporary.",1
"Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Well, it is true except for Pam. Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. So where does this leave Bud?",1
"If you get a chance, please see this movie - won't disappoint. I cannot even count the number of times I've seen it.",1
( The VHS was 1. ! Shot in a 2. Travolta is fantastic.,1
"However, I think the photography was amazing! What a feat! Thanks, Ray - - Great work!",1
Debra Winger was in her prime. There is plenty of charisma.,1

"In 1980 that was beginning to boom and Texas was definitely a growing place in the USA. < br / > < br / > I liked Debra Winger's character best in this film. And when she beats him at Gilley's mechanical bull, a man's game, that's it for him.",1
< br / > < br / > Gotta be a 10 for me! If you didn't then trust me and watch the movie.,1
Early in film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married. Marriage is a focus here that is often missed. He was believable and real. What does that have to do with this comment? She soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side. < br / > < br / > How anyone can compare Bud to Vinnie Barbirino is shocking to me.,1
"When the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise, pace improved quite a bit. In other words, the film is nominated and yet the director didn't get any sort of career boost.",1
"Stairway to Heaven "" is a true gem. "" And then there is the Stairway itself!",1
"< br / > < br / > A pity there were no sequels. Crazy, man. I guess not.",1
What a shame.,1
It's like watching a no frills music video today. That's a compliment folks.,1
It is fitting that the best of this genre should come from this studio.,1

"These cats are solid gone, daddy - o...",1
"Interesting, fast - paced and amusing. Did one of the hosts adopt him?",1
I was hooked instantly. And it vanished from air!,1

"The director does a wonderful job following through with the title of his film, truly portraying a picture of madness.",1
< br / > < br / > 5 out of 5 - Essential It's easy to make really general comments about a film like this.,1
"Some fascinating shots of Japanes life, streets, buildings in the 1920s. And the place is swarming with mad folks, laughing, hiding, and in one case dancing frenetically night and day. When he wakes he is relieved, and mops the floor. She's tormented by something.",1
The actors are choreographed more like dance than acting.,1
"Multiple exposures of the dancer represent the patients'point of view and their confused "" view "" of the world. It is also a very complicated film to follow, as it has not got intertitles. Long thought lost, a print was found in the 70s and a music soundtrack added to it, which fits perfectly with the images. The unsettling weather metaphors the mental condition of patients and introduces one of the them : a former dancer. < br / > < br / > In three words A MUST SEE.",1
"But I hope it will make people research the subject more. In this the series does quite well. What was going through Goebbels, Goring and Hess's mind?",1
"< br / > < br / > The movie was earlier presented as a TV series and later converted into a movie format. The production value, sets, costumes, etc. But still the movie is gripping, every engaging and entertaining. Hitler is not shown as someone having charishma and attraction, and there the movie fails to convince Hitler's portrayal.

He is amazingly good brilliant! < br / > < br / > The story is about Hilter's life and how he came to power. Among many movies they showed, this was the one I had not seen.",1
But movies about history or religion are always criticised by their accuracy. Especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened. 7. Of course it's not 100 % accurate. But I do agree with the critique that his childhood years went by too fast. I don't know what it is with this movies.,1
It was not. Robert Carlyle does a fine portrayal of his subject. So why is it hilly in the movie? Yet this strictly American custom is employed in the film. Yet it is announced as a surrender.,1
Never shown on TV?,1
"The tempo is at times drowsy, and the film does suffer from it, being approximately 2, 5 hours long.",1
"This should never be used to educate. Those who are ignorant of the past doom us to repeat it "". Top - notch. They get dates and many occurrences, and do them justice. Only showing his negative sides, and exaggerating them. "" He was a human being.",1
"Ending six years later in Germany's utter defeat. Having arrived there, this film ends.",1
But he was not portrayed as a super - villain but more like an ambitious politician. We should not forget that this movie is not a documentary. I believe it made the movie more realistic even with some inaccuracies in the historical facts. < br / > < br / > The flow of history is nicely reflected to spectators. Also society's reaction was also reflected to movie but it was very limited. Mostly we only saw his followers rampaging the streets and cheering him. Who cares how did his dog died anyway.,1
"A better job could've been done portraying the "" charming "" Hitler. I missed it when it was first on in 2003.",1
"Hitler : The Rise of Evil "" was shrouded in controversy before it ever aired, and that controversy may obscure the accomplishment of the film. After all, while else would a nation have followed him? "" Peter Stormare and Liev Schrieber also give strong support. A sick, diseased maniac, to be sure, but a human being nonetheless. It is necessary to know the story of how Hitler was able to come to power to prevent it from happening again.",1
Each scene he has with Hitler is explosive! And she's brilliant! They provide a true portrait of marriage and betrayal. There is She uses her eyes and voice to suggest all the horror that will be visited on millions in the years to come. Zoe Telford very nearly matches Jena Malone with her portrayal of Eva Braun.,1
"There is some rather forced confusion at the start of the episode, with lines like : < br / > < br / > McCoy - Where did they go? Atoz - Wherever they wanted to. Kirk makes his way back to library first, and finally convinces Mr. Atoz they don't belong in his planet's history. Spock begins acting increasingly emotional, showing anger toward McCoy and deep affection for Zarabeth, the woman.",1
"There's something compelling and strangely believable about this episode. Kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th Century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste.",1
"They meet a freaky librarian type dude ( very well played ). ! I want it on DVD fer shure vulcans!!!!! This one is a classic, don't miss it.... It takes a ton of convincing before Spock finally gives in and leaves. This is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of Trek. Anyhow, they all finally escape, leaving the poor cavegirl behind. First the guys beam down to an alien planet thats about to explode.",1
"You WON'T disappointed! But I gradually found myself more & more engaged in this movie I'd never seen or heard of, until I was completely absorbed. WHY has it never received the same public notice & video - store prominence?",1
"However, it's the former pair that has the most trying time. Kirk is in the same planet's colonial period.",1
"All too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository. < br / > < br / > FYI - - Ian Wolfe, the excellent character actor, played Mr. Atoz. Kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. ! The scenes with Spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of normally logical guy.",1
"( p. 272 ) However, Freiberger reasoned, the ice age setting allowed Spock to experience emotions since this was a time when Vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state. The Enterprise warps away just as the star explodes. Spock's acting here was excellent as Freiberger candidly admitted to Shatner. The penultimate episode of Star Trek's third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season. Nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the show's executive producer, Fred Freiberger, that Vulcans weren't supposed to fall in love.",1

Indian Summer! It was very nostalgic for me.,1
He said she was 21. This seemed very real life. That made no sense. None of them had very great careers. I said where's Bill Paxson? The movie was compared to The Big Chill.,1
"Mike Binder's Indian Summer knows this and explores this like he was twelve years old. They take toilet paper out of the stalls, the put toothpaste on sleeping bags and so on. I am a sucker for films like this. It brings you back to a time when life was simpler and much more fun. Uncle Lou is played perfectly by Alan Arkin.",1
99 it cost me. It's good.,1
When I watch it I wish that I could be 10 - 14 again.,1
I would be there so fast. So who ever thought this movie was lame... The Camps I went to weren't even this great.,1
Indian Summer is a good film.,1
"< br / > < br > I recommend this funny, moving movie to all.",1

A great ensemble cast!,1
If you have not seen this movie.. what are you doing?,1
"Arkin shines as always. Check it out ; you won't be dissappointed. The transfer is rather poor, but at least WHOLE movie is visible. ; - )",1
Once exciting activities now seem mundane.,1
"It never goes to over the top and melodramatic, always keeping its warmth, charm and realism. Indian Summer is a warm, multi - character film, that would make a fine afternoon film ( with a bit of editing ). < br / > < br / > For a warm, nostalgic character movie, I sincere recommend.",1
Pressburger and Powell's greatest movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > For me, this is a 9 / 10 film. Don't read any more, just do it.",1
"To me, it is exactly that lack that makes this film work.",1
A movie that makes you feel good. All of them are now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers.,1
"One more thing, this film reassured me that a camp doesn't have to be a site of bloody murders.",1
"Yes, it can be very corny but it is also very funny and enjoyable.",1
Does anyone know exactly how long this series ran? I was delighted to finally see the release of Amazing Stories the first season on DVD.,1

A true John Woo masterpiece.,1
"Scott is right. The sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best although quite good. If you haven't seen it, you have to. But, this is one example where Chinese swordplay surpasses the Japanese.",1
"But it really is almost an "" 8 "". Now, martial arts ; * that's * beautiful! The bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil, but entertaining none the less. I am a kung fu fan, but not a Woo fan. This is good stuff.",1
An injection of humour from Woo. The scene with Chan and Pray was probably the highlight of the movie.,1
I highly recommend this movie. This film has only had a VHS release in the UK.,1
"As a lover of bad movies, I definitely hit paydirt with this one.",1
It's a fun movie that's more technically sound and acted. Check it out!,1

Even less with Chasey, and Ginger Lynn shows no skin and has the worst Irish accent ever.",1
"So when I heard about a porn - star gore movie, I was really excited. The ending makes no sense. And I love gory movies. The two wild murders are even given extended shots on DVD. It's never clear how many cannibals we're dealing with. The gore!",1

It is terribly obvious of how little of a fight kids put up.,1
Could it be that the flesh hungry maniac is still at large in Forest? Well what do you think? Unfortunately that label has got a peerlessly abysmal track record with DTV slashers. Could Samhain finally be worthwhile ammunition to their contemptible catalogue cannon?,1
"He spots another couple kissing on a park bench, and he has a blast ruining their fun. < br / > < br / > The image is of the tramp who really cannot get the girl. Everyone ends up in the pond except Chaplin.",1

Sometimes he pushes the line at his job and beats on the sex offenders. Erroll did do a good job but at the sake of the safety of Allison.,1
"I caught this movie late at night on cable, and I was pleasantly surprised. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good in it.",1
"Somewhat confusing and with some irritating plot holes but it does have a number of striking set pieces. The Flock gets that point across nicely. < br / > < br / > As a suspense flick, The Flock isn't as successful. The world we live in is a pretty sick place and the further one can distance himself from the worst the happier that person is. At the very beginning you can clearly see his work has got the better of him.",1
"Also, there are the people who kidnapped the girl. That part is a little far fetched.",1
"Peter suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other world's court, he is granted this. This is probably one of the most original love stories I have seen for ages, especially for a war based ( briefly ) film. Outstanding!",1

He holds no punches in tracking these people, following them and making absolutely sure they don't re - offend and if they do he'll be the one to identify and stop them any way he can. Hong Kong director Wai - keung Lau did a decent job holding it together but I think cast is what made it watchable. It's an action thriller drama that kept my glued to the Television with it's story. In fact it's much the same way that The Hunting Party dealt with war. I really like Richard Gere...",1
"Now, let's go to the negative points. I did not have too much interest in watching The Flock. It's not memorable at all, but it'entertaining. Plus, I think the film should have been more ambitious.",1
"Well, maybe. Nothing I saw detracted from the power of this film.",1
"But this performance is all different. He is not pretty in this one, and he is not charming. < br / > < br / > Direction That is how good Gere was here. It does not seem that this movie managed to please a lot of people.",1
HELLO! this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form.,1
"Also, they have a pretty cool dustbin lorry ( Garbage Collecting Truck ) in that scene too. ! The story is a spoof of many films including a Will Smith film, as you might have guessed,'Men In Black '.",1
HA! That's the point. Of course it's stupid. Us stupid Americans like our stupid humor.,1
"). It is about two garbagemen, who become "" Men in White "" and then stop an invasion from space. Anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head.",1

"Tarkovsky, is one.",1
"'It's a courageous and thought provoking enterprise. He examines the ever illusive question of'who am I'and'what is I? If that was the purpose of maker, he succeeded quite well.

Gert de Graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves. Bart Klever? The script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination.,1
Switch off the conscious control knob of mind and job done.,1
< br > < br / > I hope it comes out on DVD so I can watch it again more carefully. There is beautiful scenery and optical illusions.,1
Which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest? Can anything serve as a basic orientation point in the narrative space?,1
"', and turn it into a captivating and fun - filled 100 minutes. The film centers on Bart, a writer struggling with his screenplay, ` The Sea That Thinks. We all create our own reality, or do we?",1
Ugh. I liked Top Gun.,1
And what after life? It is all so imaginative! Why is this movie not in the 250 best?,1
Some of the acting was a bit suspect.,1
"Very interesting and, thankfully, entertaining. Don't be expecting any laughs, though. 7 out of 10.",1
I quite enjoyed this movie for two reasons.,1
"Being American, I Why? His acting was marvelous, as usual. Also, Kenny genuinely believes in the "" cause "". However, now, in this film, Ginger has out lasted his worth, and has become a very dangerous loose cannon.",1
I thought this movie was LOL funny. And so the hijinx begin!,1
"This film deserves a 10 for its brilliant portrayal of the world as experienced in the mind of a playboy. Besides, it's just funny.",1
"Enjoyable for what it is....... Okay, like many other such films, spawned out of a SNL skit.",1
What a pity. Such imagination!,1
And that'OK.,1
"finally Billy Dee Williams, reliving his Colt 45 days, gives the movie a touch of class. well fear not because Tim Meadows comes through in spades. its a just great time if you don't feel like taking yourself too seriously.",1
"Nothing that will win awards, but nonetheless, some modern comedy gold. "" I really don't understand why people get so upset and pan this movie! 10 - 4 Aprico! """,1
"If not, stay away with extreme prejudice. For instance, in one scene, Meadows compares himself to Mother Theresa, but for bonin '. Will Ferrell, the repressed homosexual, rounds out solid performances. Don't pop this one in expecting beautiful cinematography or Oscar - worthy performances. < br / > < br / > See this movie if you're into adult humor. How much plot would one expect from an SNL skit? Tim Meadows has to be the most underrated of SNL's recent cast members.",1

"Do not question your love. What is love? Had I succumbed to Hollywood's'dumb - down'sit - com humor? There he was, Leon Phelps, smirking and... making me laugh! I employed the click feature more than once, dear readers. And he's not kidding. What had happened? The truth of the matter is I like "" The Ladies Man "" more than I should.",1
Who knows.,1
Whenever he would do this character on the show I would crack up laughing. This movie is also packed with some highly quotable lines that can be recited for years to come.,1
Great comedy.,1
"So back to the main story. Leading this bunch of guys is, surprise! The story basically centers around Leon and sex. Will Ferrell from SNL.",1
Made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable.,1
"Suddenly he spots her a few yards away. Bob Hope's first credited film is a delight! He plays an American playboy millionaire on vacation in Paris. So he wins girl, the race and the bet and sings two more songs! But Hope claims he can win her in less than 30 days with "" no "" money!

"I love bad movies. The Barbarians & Company is camp classic everybody should see once. But if they can't act, they yell and scream every time they do something important. I can't describe how much I laughed when I watched this first time. The Barbarians is so idiotic movie. And that's the reason why I love Italian rip off cinema of 1970s and 1980s.",1

"In other words, the Ragneks are a bunch of traveling circus freaks! The supportive cast is splendid as well. just trashy, cheesy, campy and enormously fun!",1
If you get a chance to see this movie do so.,1
"the Barbarian Brothers who both seem to be having a ball with their characters. < br / > < br / > What can I say, - this simply is a really fun and lighthearted take on genre and I recommend it wholeheartedly!",1
"So, a couple of days ago I inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time. Yes, I've grown up. Yes, I loved this movie when I was a kid.",1
Outstanding movie.,1
I've joined IMDb so people know what a great film this is!,1
At last they reach Mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and sensation of trip's significance is overwhelming to Reda.,1
There's really no clear winner.,1
I won't repeat all that has been said already by other viewers of this film.,1
"He later encounters June riding a bicycle, and instantly matches the body with the voice. It sounds misconceived, but connection is soon made lucid with the events that follow. < br / > < br / > Following a string of other patriotic war films,'The Archers'made this one their quirkiest, skittish and most patriotic of the lot.",1
"It also provides a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional Islam and the secular younger generation. Sure, there were times of understanding, but so often there was an undercurrent of hostility and repression. Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan descent. A nice and unusual film.",1
"it sets up its two main characters gently and easily. viewers learn the underlying tensions quickly, which is a tribute to the director. this isn't'Bonnie and Clyde'or'Thelma and Louise'but it is a fine road movie. it certainly isn't'Natural Born Killers'and is all better for it.",1
The father never speaks in French though Reda understands Arabic but can only seem to answer in French. About the movie... it's one of those well - acted sweet movies. Bot of them are affectionate in their frustrations. You see magnificent views in every city they go.,1
"In Bulgaria another man they ask directions of confirms he can speak French but then provides an extensive commentary in Bulgarian. For westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating. They eventually make it to Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of Vatican but on a much grander scale. The father is stubborn in a lot of things which the son doesn't understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama, although it is often rather irksome. The father is clearly devoutly religious, but the son is unimpressed ; he accepts out of obligation to his father rather than to religion, he'd rather be with his ( non - Muslim ) girlfriend.",1
Father and son communicate very little. You'll be glad you did. IN fact they speak different languages.,1
"But this is not a tour, and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights. And hence, we set off in this arduous journey with father and son, being not the best of pals. Through the many encounters, they actually team up quite well despite their differences. < br / > < br / > Reda's father is in his twilight years, and wishes to do the Haj.",1
"Yes, "" The Hasty Hare "" goes all out. And believe me, you definitely will. - Bugs has more stuff planned for voyage back to Mars. In this case, Marvin the Martian has an assignment to bring back an earthling.",1
"Enjoy "" Hasty Hare ""! : - ) He greets them with treats, thinking they are trick or treaters their costumes.",1
Of course the creature he picks is Bugs Bunny. < br / > < br / > I really enjoyed this although the ending is a little weak compared to the rest of the story.,1
"The scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today? Again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made. In fact you'd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect, beauty and soul of Powell and Pressburger's masterpiece.",1
I certainly recommend it.,1
""" We want bush! "" There wasn't a lot of meat on any of the roles in this film, but he really shines.",1
"Only a couple of days later it was shown on television. The first reason is that this movie has an actual story. That movie was really so bad, that I was convinced that all his movies would be like that.",1
"Pecker has a cute sister who goes simply nuts over SUGAR and is actually an ADDICT, taking spoonfuls of sugar from a bag.",1
"Once again, Waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. ). "" Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a kid who is obsessed with photography.",1
I thought this was an utterly charming film.,1

"No pretty models, no gorgeous men, just hard living. ! This wonderful film pokes fun at the plasticness of the urban art chain.",1
This is John Waters best film to date.,1
"Recommended! < br / > < br / > Edward Furlong of "" Terminator 2 "" fame plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and Water's long - time actress Mink Stole.",1
The best thing about this movie is that it is fun.,1
"It was part of the recent tribute to Mr. Powell that played at the Walter Reade in New York. He was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie. This was quite a coup, and well ahead of its times. This film marked one of the highlights in Mr. Niven's career.",1
Another 10 out of 10! Pecker live in a semi - normal middle - class family. His mom runs a thrift shop and loves to dress - up poor people.,1
"Funny and somewhat lighthearted ( if that is possible for Waters ), this is one of those films I would watch on a rainy day.",1
"Geez. Even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the "" adequate "" attention to her. < br / > < br / > Well this is an Indie movie with an edge but not for everyone.",1
it is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality.,1
All of the actors are quite real and very odd.,1
"And it's a heavy load she's carrying. Given the overall results, I expect she dealt as honestly with the topic as she was allowed to. There were lots of these topics that Hollywood and the Production Code kept hidden until the rebellious 1960's. Ferguson ( Tod Andrews ). Still, his gentle and understanding presence comes across as a little too miraculous and a little too Hollywood. Overall, this first part is earnest and well - done. Will she ever be able to relate to men again? < br / > < br / > Give Lupino a ton of credit for dealing with the topic in the first place. It's he ( to quote a phrase ) who "" gives her courage to face life again "".",1
"She goes into a fugue state, running away to Los Angeles on a bus but stumbling off at a rest stop. She lies about her identity and takes a job packing oranges. Leaving the plant after working late one night, she finds herself being stalked. The two fall vaguely in love, but it's clear to Andrews that Powers is keeping dire secrets. In the ensuing scene the best in the movie she tries to escape her pursuer in a forbidding maze of buildings and alleys but fails.",1
"Forget that this is a "" B "" movie. Tod Andrews, too, has some fine moments as the minister who reaches out to help her. Based on her work in this film, I'm surprised that she did not have a more successful acting career.",1
"They'll be partially mistaken ; they didn't make movies like this in the past times either. This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. So, do You want to know what have we done during our lifetime?",1
It's not kind of movie we see often.,1
< br / > < br / > As for acting I think it was good. This movie really surprised me. On the downside I think I will put Esai Morales portrait of Markie.,1
Bring it on.,1
That's rock'n'roll. < br / > < br / > Well worth watching. I also agree with Semprinni that the recordings Pete Best plays on say the last word on the subject of why he was fired.,1
"< br / > < br / > Another irritation was how "" choppy "" the editing was for television. Having just watched this film again from a 1998 showing off VH - 1, I just had to comment. Why they felt they had to Americanize this film for American audiences is beyond me. It wound up taping in black and white for some reason, which gave it a period look that I grew to like. Also, in this "" later "" version when Paul sees the girls, he says, "" Look, GIRLS!",1
"Also as a bonus you get to see the original Cavern club in the film. The Beatles are seen performing songs that hardly were even composed by that time. This is exactly what'Birth of the Beatles'offers to us, the simple story known to us without any extravaganza. The idea of making a film about the Beatles sounds doomed idea, as no production can catch the idea of the actual historic Beatles.",1
"I highly recommend this film. The film was produced by a legend of the Rock and Roll era, Mr Dick Clark. However, the critics did not care for it, nor did the public, for it did not have a long life span in the theater. As told by the point of view of former Beatle Pete Best.",1
"My only records until then were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. I thought hmmmm, if girls like them, they must be crap.",1
"Yes, he still f ^ @ ks up all his stunts because he is too drunk. I had to own it! ! I couldn't believe TVNZ let it on! A lot of the humor will be lost on non - NZ'ers, but give it a go!",1
< br / > < br / > The plot was preposterous. This film was great.,1
"The moral of the tale, of course, is timeless : love conquers all. Enchanting, romantic, innovative, and funny.",1
!,1
"The best thing in them also was the constant tension. < br / > < br / > SCRIPT is good. The usual "" based on a true story "" makes me think it should mostly be true. < br / > < br / > STUNTS are mostly terrific, especially for a TV movie. So you are not going to go how much is true? How many films can say that? A stunt driver could do that at 100 mph. Odd that they didn ' You know just the basis is. < br / > < br / > It's rare for a movie to have SUSPENSE. But maybe that's my error. Not even many big ones.",1
"I think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy! And laugh you will. This film is the pinnacle in entertainment, I laughed from beginning to end. How this has not become a cult film I don't know.",1
< br / > < br / > I highly recommend it.,1
"I really like this movie because in Australia, Chinese movies like these never get shown during prime time. Whoever said China isn't ready for rock music? Check it out! Daniel Wu is absolutely superb, with his clean and crisp voice, honest acting, and a total chick magnet.",1
"His innate dispiritedness and reticence fit blue mood of the film perfectly. It may be the remake of 1987 Autumn's Tale after eleven years, as the director Mabel Cheung claimed.",1
"The two should do more work together. Overall, This movie is a good one. Nicole Sheridan... That's too bad. Which is okay, but is she finished?",1
"I'm married. "" "" Is Gabe happily married? "" Yes. """,1
"Or is it? This continuous understatement is part of the film's appeal. But, in my opinion, the film's charm comes from Marius Goring as Conductor 71. The music even has a dreamy quality. I LOVE this movie.",1
"See it especially for Clara Lago, who does a great job as Carol. She is definitely one to watch. I think you'll like it.",1
"I highly recommend this film for all ages. The LEI average for this film is 9. It was a major event of the 20th century, yet hardly any Americans know of it.",1
"I thought to myself,'Awe, look at her! Such a pretty little girl. I found myself immersed in the story and her character. Her acting was superb as well. I was deeply moved by this movie in many respects. True to life and very human. He was remarkable.",1
"< br / > < br The ending, though sad, is uplifting as Carol's journey to maturity is complete. Carol's father Robert ( Ben Temple ) is a fighter pilot who has sided with the Republicans against Franco and is rarely with his family. Aurora has a past : she left her lover Alfonso ( Alberto Jiménez ) to marry Robert, and Alfonso in turn married Aurora's cold sister Dolores ( Lucina Gil ).",1
"< br / > < br / > The movie gets exceptional marks for its lovely camera work and music. Years have passed and you gather that they are coming to Spain from New York City. Despite the strangeness, Carol speaks reasonably good Spanish and much of the film is about how she adapts. The rather slow and rambling pace isn't bad provided you are someone who can accept films this way.",1
The colors are magnificent. Again great work from Peninsula Iberica! It is a better lesson in history than any book could contain. It is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism.,1
"For this girl, everything is new, in it's foreignness. < br / > < br / > Imanol Uribe directs this film by the numbers. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, teacher who befriends Carol. < br / > < br / > Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. Northern Spain's magnificent landscape is shown.",1
< br / > < br / > My rate : 7 / 10 Another Spanish movie about the 1936 Civil War.,1

"This does not seem futuristic at all today, which is a bit alarming. Heroine Amber is, to put it lightly, a bit stereotypical, and the subtly named Damen Killian is a typical evil TV man. He is quite good isn't he. Enjoy. It's as simple as that. This is an Arnold movie. It also features some at the time futuristic digital video editing, allowing the bad guys to change faces in a video to fool their audience. It's hopelessly 80's, but I find that charming.",1
"The Running Man faithfully followed this blockbuster recipe to a T and Arnie's ( mostly male teenage ) audience lapped it up ( myself included ). Directed by Paul Michael Glaser ( best known as Det. < br / > < br / > Towards the end of the movie, Ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities, and gets to exact revenge on the show's nasty host, Killian.",1
AIDSSSSS Great acting too. Where did they go?? It was never explained.,1
"It may be an easy target, but they pull it off none the less. But who cares? Running Man viciously lampoons the modern - day American media complex, and hits its target dead - center.",1
"Running Man isn't a great movie, in fact it's kinda silly.",1
"This movie SCREAMS "" 80s. "" History has shown that this is exactly what happened.",1
"Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination knows no bounds, every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions. A Matter of Life and Death is all about the power of love and just how important life is.",1
I love this movie!,1
"Well, in the world of the Running Man, your needs will be sated. I must have watched it 30 or more times. < br / > < br / > I loved this film.",1
"The ultimate prize for a winning runner : freedom. ( The book ends rather nihilistically ; needless to say this movie doesn't. ) Or so the rules claim. I enjoyed both, but I like the movie better. No, this isn't 2001, but it's not meant to be.",1
"9 out of 10! Audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. And he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with "" How about a light? "" It's funny stuff! I could go on and on, but I don't want to spoil the movie. One can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far. Running Man demonstrates what would happen if reality TV hit rock bottom, and it is a scary picture.",1
"The government blames Richards for the massacre earning him the name "" Butcher of Bakersfield "". But soon he finds they will join him as well and makes sure Killian knows he'll be back. But as the tag line says Arnold has yet to play! They make their way to the underground, led by Mic ( Mick Fleetwood ). < br / > < br / > Meantime, The Running man is having trouble finding good new blood for the there stalkers to kill.",1
"< br / > < br / > But, on with the review. Rather than just being another brainless action film, it works very well as a parody of reality TV.",1
"It doesn't go on for 20 minutes each. All 3 are amazing. When the stalker is dead... he's dead. Arnold's best movies came in about a 4 - 5 year span. Running Man, Predator, and Total Recall ( 1990 ).",1
Hope you enjoy this gem as much as i did.,1
"The Acting is great!. ). Overall a MUST see! The Directing is great!. Marvin J. McIntyre, is good as the geeky type guy, he was cool!.",1
"That's the point. Of course, people are expected to die eventually and its up to Arnold to prove the system wrong. The action is violent, but its an action film. Dawson is perfectly irritating as the TV presenter, and all the'Stalkers'are suitably camp. < br / > < br / > I haven't read the Stephen King book, but this is a great film regardless, one of Arnold's best. 9.",1
Special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie. The acting is superb.,1
Usually it's far from the real truth. It's no secret that Reality TV is not very realistic. Not when you think about it.,1
"Now, the politics, society, and media in The Running Man seem very close to home indeed. CHECK < br / > < br / > Cameras everywhere. Not any longer.",1
"The film is also well - made in terms of effects, cinematography and score. "" The House that Bled to Death "" is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow Hammer - fans should like to see in a Short Horror tale. Overall, this is highly recommendable to Hammer fans. The episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations.",1
"). Little warning though, the sequence with the cat is hard to watch when you're an animal lover. Is the old house really haunted? In conclusion, another winner for Hammer's short - running TV series!",1
My vote is eight.,1
"The atmosphere is superb and the colour scheme on display is great too look at. There's also a mysterious monk dressed in a red robe who marauds around breaking necks with a bullwhip. As the title suggests, it's a nearby college full of girls that provides most of the victims. Overall, College Girl Murders is an excellent little mystery flick and one that comes highly recommended! The film begins in a lab where a crazy scientist has invented a new and highly toxic poison that kills its victim and makes it look like they died from a heart attack.",1
"The girls who are targeted share a room with Ann, but the reason for their murders remains a mystery SY's finest must figure out. It all seems to center around student Ann Portland ( Uschi Glas ), who, when she turns 21, is to inherit a great deal of wealth. The ending features multiple twists. Taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind, he gives them orders on who to kill and how.",1
"Even funky 60's soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time. It's like a variant on the Italian Giallo, but with slapstick elements.",1
"7 out of 10, not bad.... Scotland Yard's finest is investigating the murders of young ladies at a college.",1
"A mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poisonous gas. The white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red gown. There's a lot going on in The College Girl Murders. Just when you think the killer has been uncovered, here comes a twist.. and another. < br / > < br / > - The End. Let's just say that there are more twists than a mountain road.",1
"It is as fresh today as it was in 1946. < br / > < br / > From beginning to end it oozes class. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh it makes me think, it makes me cry.",1
"their elders. Unfortunately, Klaus Kinski had also gone on to bigger and better things. And there's a fine brassy and twangy score for retro - music fans.",1
"She connected well with the action sequences and executed with confidence. Of course there were flaws, but that comes with the territory. The chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was pretty good. Sean and Corinne delivered in this movie, and they didn't seem camera shy. For a low budget movie this was really good. His charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch. Watch out for the cameos of Jeanne and Jared.",1

"Although he is a violent bad guy, you still want him to find happiness.",1
I suggest everyone watch this short. So kid B skips and kid A goes to class. I really wanted to know what happens next. They were going to learn the meaning of life.,1
"Simple, meaningful and delivers an emotional punch.",1
"Gorgeous and disturbing. The fight scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal. Anybody who questions the politician is labeled a "" traitor "" and becomes an assassination target. Gosha's last great film of the 1960's.",1

"Ironically, the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one of first reforms of the Meiji government. Even so, the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers. It's ironic twists like this - - Gosha's big on irony - - that make the entire plot all the more bittersweet. )",1

As a Pokémon fan I enjoyed this movie very much.,1
"Here, all the main characters are capable of being objects or originators of jokes. In particular his use of moving point - of - view shots make the battle scenes extra exhilarating.

The motion picture has thrills for a thousand movies plundered for one mighty show. Joan Fontaine gambled her against the valiant sergeants three. The film is based on Kipling's heroic lines that inspire Hollywood's biggest movie 1939.,1

"< br / > < br / > "" Gunga Din "" starts out lightheartedly, with slapstick and wonderful, broad comedy, particularly by Cary Grant, who is quite funny. It's a buddy movie after all.

But the old gang is breaking up because Fairbanks is engaged to marry Joan Fontaine. It certainly has the same rough house humor that Ford laces his films with. < br / > < br / > To my surprise I learned it was George Stevens who actually directed it.

Brilliant!,1
"The noble trio must brave a series of battles and other various dangers including a thuggee cult and a temple full of gold. < br / > < br / > The biggest reason for the picture's success, however, is the pitch - perfect performances by the film's trio of extremely charismatic actors.",1
< br / > < br / > To a young boy this was a great film. Three strong male leads and only a hint of romance. Too late to lament lost innocence.,1
"That look in his eyes, I will never forget.",1
"However, this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have glorious time. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, are effective but have little to do. A trio of buddies, sergeants all in the British Army, carouse & brawl their way across Imperial India. He is unforgettable.",1
"Cutter, chasing after tall tales of golden treasures. < br / > < br / > "" Gunga Din "" was one of the great movies to come out of Hollywood's finest year, 1939. The main focus is on Sgt. The theme music is instant hummable nirvana. Even more than most great movies from that Golden year, it is entertaining in a very immediate and accessible way. That'll hold him there for a few minutes ; director George Stevens and his team will keep him to the end. Anyone with a young boy in the house who won't watch black & white movies should put this on their television set.",1
This is a great movie. com Regards Frederik. See the movie!,1
"I expect more from George Lucas. For what it is, this is a pretty good movie. I don't know if the training was quite like this bunches!",1
It was not as bad as some critics were making it out to be. The cast are also quite good.,1
"It does have some merit. Which makes me ponder. < br / > < br / > Sweet as. S Bonds. As i already said, personal taste not withstanding. Or how about Stephen Furst's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum Hubert Downs.",1

"It was chopped and edited to bits, and no original version is known to exist today. She sets her sights on a skyscraper and starts literally working her way to the top. She is so beautiful and powerful ; she just owns the whole movie! ( I don't know what the other movie was. ) Stanwyck stops at nothing in her rise to top.",1
Barb heads for the big city for better things. After the old man dies ( good! ),1
This film is sexy excellent! She knows what she wants and goes after it!,1
"In fact, some time later, she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the NEW CEO and once again she's on top ( perhaps in more way than one ). < br / > < br / > The film begins with Barbara Stanwyck working in her father's speakeasy.",1
"As always, she's fantastic.",1
"Lily reproaches him. "" The politician. My father, a swell start you gave me, nothing but men, dirty, rotten men. Incidentally, Mark Canfield was a pseudonym for producer Daryl F. Zanuck. And you'lower than any of them. "" Later, Nick chews his rebellious daughter out.",1
Lily Powers is a woman who doesn't have love on her mind just power and money. The filming and different scenes were something fantastic! The few times the music is heard is during the beginning as we are shown how she makes her way up the chain. < br / > < br / > This film was all together an alright movie.,1
The way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible. I enjoyed this movie a lot.,1
"It's worth the effort.. < br / > < br / > The story is no nonsense. An amoral woman rises to wealth first under, < br / > < br / > and then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with her. Not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one.",1
This definitely proves true in this case. Quite frankly it's a bit different.,1
"For a movie of that era, anyway. And what men want is her... well, you know.",1
He needs money Lily now has in her possession or he'll have absolutely nothing. < br / > < br / > Stanwyck is whole movie despite that usual Warner Brothers polish.,1
"Compare a film from 1939 and compare it with an early 30's film and I think you'll see what I mean. I did think while watching it that pacing seemed a bit slow at parts, but I think that about most movies the first time is see them. When her father suddenly passes away, she is able to go out into the world on her own. < br / > < br / > Once again, I'm very glad I was able to watch the original cut ; it really does make a big difference. While no sexual acts are explicitly shown on screen, it is very obvious what is happening off camera. Also any John Wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role.",1
John Wayne ( in a suit! ) plays one of her first conquests.,1
B + Finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city. Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims.,1
She has been rendered cynical and numb by years of being offered up as a sexual favor to her father's customers. This is a hard - boiled Warner Brothers film starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck.,1

Lily leaves for the big city ( New York ) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. See it! < br / > < br / > This is pre - code Hollywood at its best.",1
"< br / > < br / > The preferred version of "" Baby Face "" is the 76 - minute restored cut. Sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung. Perhaps the bank failures in the 1930's owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women. Only her African - American confidante, Chico, receives Lily's affection, trust, and loyalty.",1
Brilliant movie. I thought it was one of the best sequels I have seen in a while.,1

Baby Face "" was released the same year Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Another reason d'tat for her behavior and cold, calculating exterior.",1
"All in a day's work. Here, she sings or hums movie's theme, "" St. Louis Woman "" throughout. Trouble follows, and she's soon involved in a huge scandal.",1
Stanwyck rules!,1
"At least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process. At a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it. No sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that. < br / > < br / > In this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money..... lots of it. No surprise, I guess.",1
"< br / > < br / > BABY FACE is a prime example of pre - Code naughtiness. A wonderful actress, Stanwyck has full opportunity here to display her ample talents. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook & Henry Kolker portray a succession of her unfortunate victims. This would be the only time these two performers appeared together on screen.",1
"I don't know if I'm just weird, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film. : )",1
Once again this shows that at the end of the day the needs of many will in fact outweigh the needs of the few.,1
A great film to educate young people about democracy. This is an astounding film. Riveting stuff.,1
And in Venezuela it is loose. It is not only History that Bites.,1

"Long live Chavez. Truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience. These filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before. This really is an incredible film.

There is an electric sense of hope and optimism that change for the better is coming to the festering barrios.

The Irish crew set off with those intentions.,1
Jeff Webster ( James Stewart ) doesn't like people. The year is 1896. But also he'vulnerable. The acting work is superb.,1

"< br / > < br / > Thank you Jon Anderson, Steven Soderbergh & Benicio Del Toro. And, it hearkens a new style of film making. No Swelling sound track. Anderson was consultant on this film ( or these 2 films ). No Faux drama. It doesn't try to'tell the story '. A person's life is too multifaceted to try and tell in 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 hours. He did a wonderful job and I will respect him for ever for this. What makes this film a true thing is that it is clean.",1
"He seems to have specialized in playing best friends. 10 / 10. A masterpiece. Still, Stewart plays it so damn well, he makes this character very human. And I ought to single out Walter Brennen, as well. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of the Western genre, The Naked Spur.",1
Villagers expose him. Soderbergh looks firmly at Che's inflexible dedication. It is the concept. This is not a war movie. Che's men attack and are attacked.,1
"In Bolivia, he's dealing with a bunch of soldiers whose hearts are not fully in it. His army is like a horse that doesn't want to be led.",1
He has succeeded.,1
Che's capture and death are dealt with well. It is probably too long.,1
I was struck by how hard it would be to try something as Che tried. I watched part one two days ago and today I saw part two. A very thought provoking and well done film ; make every effort to see it.,1
"I couldn't have said it any better myself. But you're only killing a man, you'll NEVER kill the cause! "" However, the powerful elite obviously weren't going to go for that.",1
"OK, I am che - chatting a lot of crap towards your way! It surprises me that I actually got the courage to watch the bio flick or flicks "" Che : Parts 1 & 2 "". In fact, Che ended up being dead meat enchelada when he was captured and killed by the Bolivian militia in 1967. Why?",1
Che : Part Two is the excellent culmination of this experiment.,1
"As it turns out, this film far exceeded my expectations. The odds stack up against the revolutionaries. < br / > < br / > The direction throughout is superb.",1
"Of course dying young helps. Che's image has to be one of the most over exploited ever. Had he been butt ugly, I have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination? 5 hours is about right for a movie. The battle scenes zing as if you were dodging the bullets yourself.",1
Gannon locks Jeff up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town. He fines Jeff the ownership of his cattle and Jeff just has to eat crow for the time being. Jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold.,1
"Again, the rules have changed, and in this case it's hard to tell if there was any chance of success at all. I posit that it's the dark turn of Che's life that is the real reason why most people prefer Part One to Part Two. I feel exactly the opposite. For the most part it was structured finely but somewhat distracting. Many reviews I've read reveals that most people tend to like Part One better than Part Two.",1
"Yet, as Che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle. Following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such.",1
"As part of the quasi - conventionality of Steven Soderbergh's epic 4 + hour event, Che's two stories are told as classic "" Rise "" and "" Fall "" scenarios. Part Two picks up... not where the last film left off. True, he did kill, and executed, and felt justified all the way. ), but these are minor liabilities. But what's sadder still is that Guevara, no matter what, won't give in.",1
"I'm talking about Steven Soderbergh's'Che,'of course.",1
"But should genuinely inspire us to higher goals, a higher purpose. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw called it a "" flawed masterpiece. "" In Part Two, he fails. Heroes can be real or imaginary ( or somewhere in - between ). There is an air of mise - en - In Part One, Che succeeds.",1
"So don't go into this movie expecting a Rambo shoot em up, its a true story!",1
"I don't know if we ever were. But I felt into a trap perpetrated by... who? Go see it, now, on big screen The humanity of the man is overwhelming. He took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why. Terrible I know. I love cinema so what I'm about to confess embarrasses me deeply.",1
"There's perhaps a special reason why The Fox and the Child hit a special note in my heart. < br / > < br / > The technical mastery is astounding. Again, it caught me a bit off - guard. For that, I have this movie to thank. How did they do it? And that's life. But I didn't just like it, I loved it. It's just wonderful.",1
"The wildlife footage is still fascinating. ( The story, while nice, is really incidental.",1
"Now, admittedly, I'm no ardent student of the genre. Respectable folk could get hurt out there. Sadly, It is the push - pull between lawlessness and order ; the American West represented freedom, but also the prospect of the wild, the untamed.",1
"its simple telling of a child's love for nature and in particular a fox is told well. which works for children very well. amazing just amazing. it holds up well on DVD but on the big screen this was something else. not being preached to is very important, you make your own mind up. A must see for anyone who loves photography.",1

Can someone enlighten me on that? Still worth it if they can sit still. I think that's important for kids to see and try to understand.,1

I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries.,1
I found the film to be quite creepy. It's not exactly the easiest film to find. It's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers. I love CAGED TERROR.,1

The guy ends up caged in chicken coop, and has to watch his girl friend being ravished by the two guys. You gotta love this stuff! I still own the tape, and I confess, I've watched it more than once from beginning to end!",1

"Just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging, pervasive fog. The lovely Rosemary La Planche makes an ideal heroine, beautiful, spirited yet vulnerable. Not only is the plot involving and the characters fascinatingly drawn, but the setting is absolutely out of this world!",1
"But who's complaining? < br / > < br / > Rosemary LaPlanche does her usual imitation of someone in a coma that passes for her acting style. It's not the story that is the major attraction but the shrouded sets, lighting and the general moodiness of the piece.",1
"How is that for a twist. Books on early feminist films should be sure to include this overlooked work. And be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection. No snake, gator or ghostly strangler would dare bother this gal. I had never seen this film before.",1
She takes over the ferry business as the ghost closes in on the man she loves. < br / > < br / > The plot is simple. The fog does create a mood but it also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry land. Its definitely worth a look if you can come across it.,1

"I tried, but failed.",1

"Not a great Picford film, but still worth seeing. are highlights of this 1917 feature. Very effective.",1
I really wanted to like this film and I don't think I was terribly disappointed. It just doesn't seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each other. This is a sick and bigoted thing that Griffith did in so many of his films - - especially in BIRTH OF A NATION. The only major difference is that this film is set in the North and THE PATRIOT was in the Carolinas.,1
This movie is the result. < br / > < br / > Comparisons with BIRTH OF A NATION ( 1915 ) are inevitable. Walter Butler ( Lionel Barrymore ) a renegade British officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one.,1

"This is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in German, and highly simplified German at that. And, oh yeah, Hedy does get her kit off.",1
Unique peek into the American NORTHT WEST pioneers is very educational and entertaining. The production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and love.,1
"< br / > < br / > None of this is intended to belittle today's film - making. ( No need to recap the plot, since others have done so already. ) Thus, the burden of the story is shared between the film - maker and the viewer. This amounts to another extreme departure from today's very literal fare, where visuals only seem to count when they excite the audience. But in sense that the characters seldom speak when we expect them to. I don't claim either to be any better or worse.",1
The director's style is distinctly European.,1
"They don't jar as much as one would imagine. It belongs amongst best films ever made. Machatý seems an expert at using motifs. The final bit is odd, to say the least.",1
"Some thought it to be scandalous. Eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake. But the audiences couldn't stay away. After an awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other. The next day, she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. This was to be the start of a legendary career.",1
"< br / > < br / > Alas, at the end of the day, an'okay'Polanski movie is still better than most other'good'movies. < br / > < br / > The only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is certainly a good comedic actor. < br / > < br / > Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, doesn't quite do himself justice here. Definitely worth a watch, just don't expect to be blown away.",1
"The Tenant "" is a neglected gem. This film is great. """,1
"It won't happen again, Polanski's good - natured but slightly nervous tenant says, but there is no peace even in moving a cabinet or a chair. Can he register complaints? ) This is a case of not so much mistaken identity but of there being a lack of peace of mind with oneself and surrounding people. writhes in his bed in bandages. But the other tenants are conservative to the max in terms of noise ; after a Saturday night at Terkovsky's with a few friends, there are complaints of too much noise.",1
"It also features a fine cast, all of whom are in good form, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. ; I remember this factor bugging me on first viewing as well, and I'm sorry to say it's no clearer now!",1
"But these are trivial concerns. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself, and the mountain scenery can't be beat. A fine Western costume drama.",1
Busy Phillips acting is OFF the CHAIN!!!,1
"The ending caught me off guard, but what an ending! It leaves the viewer a lot to think about. But it is also a dark comedy. < br / > < br / > But either way, it is a fascinating descent into madness. This is my kind of film.",1
< br / > < br / > One thing I didn't like about this film is how it was done in English.,1
He and Stella become pretty close. The fantastic Shelley Winters is The Concierge. It gives a lot of that psychological scare. Later Simone dies.,1
"The circle is closed. 'The Tenant'is quite an interesting work by Polanski, one of the first of his European exile. Here is the example of a film that was not well received when it was made, but whose standing seems to be raising in time. Soon the neighbors don't seem to be what they are, it's a conspiracy to make him crazy, or to make him enter the life and role of the dead girl.",1
"Damn, he makes for one ugly chick! We also get to see him running around in drag, which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time!",1
This oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lay at the time he made it.,1
Then the twists and turns start. Are the neighbors trying to kill him?,1
"But is he being possessed by a spirit, or is he just letting his wild imagination get the best of him? And technically speaking, it'a marvel too. A slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments may make this movie difficult to enjoy, but it's an experience nevertheless. Once I watched The Tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie. He becomes obsessed with her and slowly starts becoming her : he wears her clothes, puts on makeup, talks like her. It's this hesitation between what is real and imaginary, and which Polanski never resolves, that makes this such a fascinating movie. In fact this movie can be understood on a literal level as a lonely man slowly becoming crazy without any external influence.",1
"The overall weirdness of the film is also a plus. ( 9 / 10 ) Polanski was always a master at building unease, and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy.",1
"This vague sort of wishy - washy - ness is more noticeable in the novel than the movie, but there are hints of it early in film too. Polanski's Trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order. I vividly remember Ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly booed at Cannes. He seems to have few strong feelings about his likes and dislikes.",1
"This nicotine addiction proves fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. < br / > < br / > I recommend this film and now own DVD. You're wrong Mr. Dunston "". He's there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend. """,1
Roman Polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as Repulsion. The shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since there's no tangible supernatural element here.,1
"Maybe that is the reason why I took it so seriously. This film is the sum of many, many instances of great acting and great casting. Needless to say, the three films would make a magnificent boxset.",1

Meanwhile he visits Simone in the hospital and befriends her girlfriend Stella ( Isabelle Adjani ). < br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) : "" O Inquilino "" ( The Tenant "" ) My vote is eight. The performances are awesome and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful.",1
"I did not watch it. In the seventies, I really tuned into Roman Polanski. And I couldn't have invented one of those magical psychic lockers not then. Working to deserve womanness when I see it.",1
I think it´s one of the best horrormovies ever. And these egyptian hieroglyphs and other egyptian stuff?,1
A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia.,1
"It's a movie that's better experienced than described, so hop to it.",1
"Others, like Psycho, attempt in - depth scientific analysis of his mental condition. < br / > < br / > This is a rare chance to see Polanski himself in a major role. Why?",1
This is one creepy movie. Is there a difference? Or maybe just drive him mad?,1
"And boy, do I love Isabelle Adjani - she's so foxy in this movie, it's almost unbelievable. Ebert, for one, was totally unconvinced, and he slapped the movie with a vicious one - star review. And slow. - I still have an overall positive impression of it. Definitely worth picking up for pocket change on DVD. < br / > < br / > But I also enjoy the film for other reasons. < br / > < br / > Yes, movie's obscure.",1

"< br / > < br / > Polanski himself plays Telkovsky, a young man looking for an apartment in France. The supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film. Roman Polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time, as the mind behind classics such as "" Rosemary's Baby "" and "" Chinatown "".",1
"One, two, three, many, many viewings. Meek, tiny, almost insignificant. It never let's me down.",1
She is mortally shaken with the fact her attacker knows her address. Kudos to director Robert M. Young. Should she continue to render her own punishment?,1
"James Avery is seen as Security Guard. His name is Joe. She got a Golden Globe nomination. It asks question is revenge justified. The man has her purse. This is not a perfect movie, but I recommend it.",1
There aren't many movies that have riveted me as this one. James Russo was so good I hated him he was the villain and played it wonderful.,1
"Having looked at some of the other comments here, I have a main complaint with this presentation.",1
I loved this excellent movie.,1
"He doesn't have a meaty role, but serves to soften Jeff's hard edges. Evidently, he sees something of himself in Jeff, repeatedly declaring that he's going to like him. They find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction. Walter Brennan, as Ben, serves as Jeff's long time sidekick. She eventually has to decide between Gannon and Jeff.",1
A real powerhouse. He pays her a visit one fateful day. What is Marjorie going to do with Joe?,1
"Highly recommended. She then keeps him in bondage, and the consequences must be faced. 8 / 10. He is adequate as the obsessed psychopath, but at times a bit transparent.",1
"< br / > < br / > The movie ultimately amounts to a showdown between its two opponents. She manages to get away but the cops inform her that there is nothing they can do. She realizes, however, that Joe did get her wallet and knows where she lives.",1
"It does make for some disturbing and shocking images! Well done everybody involved. ), Marjorie has to play along with Joe's frightening demands.",1
"James Russo, in the performance of his career, is slimy and menacing as the would - be rapist who finds Marjorie to be much more of a challenge than he assumed. Maybe. Disturbing?",1
"< br / > < br / > Why did we take to this movie? ), down to 1 standing for Poor. Well, it's just a matter of taste.",1

"Sadly the great cinematography of the Canadian Rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average DVD transfer, with only the theatrical trailer as an extra. For most of the film there's really only a hair's breadth between him and McIntire, something the judge recognises immediately, revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he's genially planning to lynch him.",1

"Ben Hur looked expensive, but not ambitious. < br / > < br / > Was it a good film? It made me wonder : what became of Cecil B. DeMille? If I was any more gullible to such propaganda I would punish myself for having a part - German ancestry. The sinking of the Lusitania, or watching America's favorite Canadian import sinking in it? The vilification of the Germans can be compared to the way "" The Patriot "" of 2000 did the same to the British. The only good German in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of Austreheim.",1

com based on my other interests. They hit the nail on the head with this one.,1
"Fan = YOU MUST. Episodes in funny order, I kept thinking when does Dr Matt leave??? They even said the same in SFX when reviewing box - set. - they made it so confusing. 'I used to set my alarm to get back up & watch this when it was on CH 4 in 1996 at 1. 30am ( i was 14 ).",1
< br / > < br / > This show rocks!!! ! You will not be disappointed. The good news is that it is OUT ON DVD!!!! It is a shame that the network did not continue it.,1
Lucas Black as Caleb is also a superb player. I thought Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs was also superb in her portrayal.,1
"Reckon it don't get more controversial than that! I'm watching the series again now that it's out on DVD ( yay! ) Pithy and to the point is clearly not the IMDb way. ) < br / > < br / > The central performances are gripping, the scripts are layered. < br / > < br / > In 22 episodes, the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons.",1
"Colorful western. Good Technicolor adventure from Universal - International, directed by Anthony Mann.",1
"Someones at the Door "". Some Devilish ones too. There is some hot n steamy scenes.",1
Lucas was frightening and alluring. I was sorry to see it cut off..,1
"I love the series! I somehow think Trinity, SC must have been in Barwell County! Aside from the supernatural elements, everything else could very well happen in the modern South! Some things never change, and we see the "" good old boys "" every day!",1
I now understand from reading comments it got CANCELLED that's just so unbelievable.,1
? I watched the show 10 years ago and loved it!!! But there seems to be some conflict.,1
"Well worth a watch, definitely something out of ordinary! I watched this show on the basis of it being told it was reminiscent of David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a show which I adore.",1
I use to watch it when I was 8.,1
"I was lucky I saw this in the UK. < br / > < br / > Great casting, superb acting. Made us go WHAT? Compulsive viewing. Shoot exec.",1
! The suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. Sheriff Lucas gave many a viewer the willies.,1
"He is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money. He displays violence, excitement, plot twists, romance, and corruption. Ironically, he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without. People are killed. The Far Country "" is the only one out of all five Stewart - Mann westerns that is often overlooked. What is McIntire there for? A man So, Flippen is elected instead.",1
Lucas Black is great too.,1
"< br / > < br / > S Well, I bought it on DVD.",1
10 out of 10 for me. This show would never be made today and that this a shame. It does not seem right!,1
"Sure. He's Heroin. I really like this show. It's original, and thought provoking. The devil isn't always in the details. We're not afraid of the daylight, after all.",1
It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. So he started calling him Half - Ted. The sheriff is really Satan. It was pretty funny. Subtle. They had me from the first show. Most of the time he's a hero.,1
"For years I hung onto my copies of this show, ones that I had taped or had someone tape for me. That is until now. The other actors did a super job as well, so I guess you could say, even the casting was hit with me. < br / > < br / > I felt the show was wonderfully written and directed and had lots of life left yet to be lived. Which, brings me to this part ; the part about that this show is all about.",1
Thanks to the emergence of DVD at least I can see the show in it's entirety! Definitely spoilers in this review! The actors also all give such perfect performances that it more than makes up for some odd camera work. The comparisons made to Stephen King are just about right. It's small town supernatural eeriness but with fantastic layered characters.,1
"I have rarely seen a child actor with as much presence or talent as Lucas Black. After half an episode, I was hooked.",1
"As the detective out to solve case, George Nader gives perhaps his finest performance. And he is so handsome it hurts!",1

"Other than that, all usual story elements are there and the show is hilarious.",1
Actors : YES Blackadder : Rather than MACBETH...!,1
"The sarcastic, verbal wit can still be great, though much less of it is than before. Yes, his master is a buffoon, they always are. Some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced. Frankly, the amount goes through the roof. It's not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered.",1
The 3rd and in my view the best of the Blackadder series.,1
"The two thespians do a silly little act to ward off evil spirits. Every time, Edmund says Macbeth. We could still use Black Adder even today. Hugh is sensational as the dimwit Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant. It's funniest things that you will see. I love the episode which Kenneth Connor guest stars as a British thespian.",1
"Outstanding! This is a very good instalment to the popular comedy. Includes appearances from Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. Throughout this third series to the wonderfully written sitcom Blackadder tries everything he can to get rich and powerful.",1
"Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann teamed to do some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the best. Some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of film. He could play delightful old codgers, authority figures and in this case a particularly nasty and crafty villain. < br / > < br / > One of best westerns ever.",1
Hugh Laurie is a complete hoot. Holy crap this is so hysterical!,1
"It's the actual LAPD crime scene video that disturbed me. Exactly how much was Holmes involved in the murders? Sorry Lion's Gate, this was an INCREDIBLY BAD IDEA!!!",1
"Wrong Holmes movie! Bye Holmies! Yes, John Holmes! No, this is not no Alice fairy tale my friends! Ok! He died of complications from the Aids virus.",1
"Several versions of the story emerge and merge as Cox flashes jump cuts and twisting title cards amid effects and emoting. In a film full of bad guys Holmes is either the most vile, the most pathetic or both. The dialogue is fast and naturalistic and never once rings false.",1
< br / > < br / > Despite being mislead the film is actually engaging.,1
It made me want to cry at times.,1
Only Susan survives.,1
Even Dylan McDermott was surprisingly capable in his role of drug dealing biker. This movie is a victim of such circumstances.,1
"This is how out of control some lives can become. "" Opening credits : great. Cinematography : sleazy to great effect. Music : just right for this film.",1
"Dirk Diggler "" in "" Boogie Nights "" is without a doubt John Holmes, who unlike "" Dirk Diggler "", had no redeeming quality. First, this is a review of the two disc set that came together with the "" Wonderland "" DVD rental. This should be required viewing, both features on the "" Wonderland "" DVD, for anyone who had any positive opinions on the story in the movie "" Boogie Nights "".",1
"The supporting cast is just as good. However, this is a bleak, dark, disturbing, and depressing film.",1
"They were being beating with lead pipes, there's not much more that needs to be said. So, finally, it hit the shelves, and I picked it up. < br / > < br / > Overall, an excellent movie worth the watch, even if once! Furthermore, the sound effects of said murders were more than enough to whet my appetite. What followed was one of the more engaging flicks I've seen in the last couple years.",1
Boogie Nights is also roughly based on his life.,1
Once they have his stuff... they'll sit around and get high again. Great plan. He is the center of this story anyway.,1
Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are terrific.,1
"Nonetheless, it's a stunning performance. Basically, this film is a murder mystery, and as such - it's excellent. < br / > < br / > RATING : 7. Val Kilmer has described John Holmes to be a hustler, able to manipulate and control.",1
"You make a movie, of course. The cast is good. And why would it be?",1
Brilliant film of a brutal true story.,1
This guy is a GREAT actor!,1
"That story was told in "" Boogie Nights "". This is a story of a transitional and forgettable era.",1
"I am haunted by waters. "" Most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of Paul. He is a capable, charming, and brave man, but has his fatal flaws. On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops.",1
"This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever seen. < br / > < br / > I had seen Busy Phillips in other films before, but her performance in this movie is by far, her best.",1
To be honest I really don't know what the problem with it is. I've read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on DVD.,1
"John Holmes is so famous, he's infamous ( as the Three Amigos would say ). He plays Ron Launius ( I think this character is suppose to be the same as the Thomas Jane character from Boogie Nights ). Josh Lucas'performance stands out as one of the best in the movie. Director James Cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in John's life into a nightmare for all of us watching. The details of the real life murders make this movie even more eerie. He is a caricature of a real person.",1
"In fact, the entire cast turned in amazing performances in this vastly under - rated movie.",1
"To be fair, I expected car chases in this film. I don't know why there are some people who hate movie so. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose. But the rest of the cast generally give good performances.",1
Get it while it'still around.,1
A nice charming film all - in - all.,1
This is rather perfect. This is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures I saw this year. This is so exciting!,1
Watch Le Million today! is the way he acts about it.,1
"Unlike most book to movie stories, this one measures up. I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive.",1
Its an amazing little movie.,1
"Highly recommended whether you want a classic and influential work of cinema or just a fun comedy. For these reasons I refrained from giving it the highest rating. ha! """,1
"This is one irresistible great cheerful - and technically greatly made movie! There is never a dull moment in this movie! Often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressive, the entire set would obviously move. This is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early French musical. Also of course the musical moments were more than great. The overall humor is really great in this movie. < br / > < br / > 8 / 10 < br / > < br / > One of the most pleasant movies you'll ever see!",1
"The acting is very good for this kind of movie. I give this film a 9 / 10. It is cheery, funny, and romantic. I read up on them, and I buy the ones which are the most interesting to me. The romantic moments are also very well developed.",1
< br / > < br / > The storyline was quite confusing as well. In typical Japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing. I was so excited to see this film because I had always heard it was very scary. This constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me. The difference in what scares the Japanese culture and what scares the American culture felt present throughout the film.,1
The settings are creepy. 10 / 10 and 5 stars! I love whole plot!,1
It's as simple as that. This film stands on it its own. I don't agree. I didn't expect getting scared.,1
"Omigosh, this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever, ever seen. < br / > < br / > Super highly recommended. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother looks like he is having fun.",1
"It's not a great movie either. The other actors were definitely not bad either, I liked Yoko. But not always. Nice.",1
"If you want to be scared, watch this film. Therefore watching a horror film, I primarily want to be scared. You get the idea.",1
Do yourself justice and watch one of the better movies in the modern movie era. It is amazing. I can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than Brad Pitt.,1
"There were so many'surprise'- scenes ( what's the English word? ) The make - up is also VERY good. I saw "" The Grudge "" yesterday, and wow... that made you jump in your seat.",1
"While the movie was hardly special - effects - laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done. but IMHO there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections. < br / > < br / > Secondly, the production was exceptional.",1
"This was great. It was not blood and guts, it was eerie, atmospheric and terrifying. In fact, it was easily as good as The Ring which I also thoroughly enjoyed. She looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well. We are finally getting movies that actually can be categorized as "" Horror ""!! When I saw the Japanese version first, it was probably the scariest movie I had ever seen. They also set it in Japan in the same location, in the same house.",1
< br / > < br / > definitely going to get this on DVD when it comes out... a hell of a lot better than the ring.,1
and you still jump off the chair. ! I'm surprised there's people who didn't like it!,1
"This is a most - of - the - time spooky movie. I was on edge the entire movie, from the opening credits, and the music was fantastically scary. ( Can't wait for Boogeyman! ) ! Perfect for Halloween. I saw the movie by myself. ) < br / > < br / > I actually gasped aloud a few times, and cried, "" oh "" at one scene!! I felt foolish but my nerves did not care! The ending scene, too... whoa! Oh, yeah, I even half - covered my eyes a few times!",1
"The Grudge "" is a remake of Shimizu's own series of popular Japanese horror films. I watched it in theater with an audience and it was fun to see viewers go wild over this one. It probably doesn't play as well in your living room. """,1
"Karen soon learns that something is not right in Emma's home, and she attempts to "" see how deep the rabbit hole goes "". < br / > < br / > The Grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend, however. As is also the case with a large percentage of European horror, The Grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare.",1
It's a horror film at it's core.,1

It's great seeing Kris play against type. It's great flick for guys who like movies.,1

The gov't closes it down, hides the story and sanctions houses to be built over it. < br / > < br / > OK - UPDATE!!! There are a million gore gags and it's almost ALL action. But the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area. 100 % fun party movie.

"Sad. Buildings were under water. And it is obvious you are not from Australia or England. Some ground shifting (? ) So does half the movies made. It is like a huge mashing of every zombie movie ever made put through a Troma filter. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It is raw. If you hate this film so much, don't buy it. There is no need for personal attacks and to call the crew or cast "" Trailer Trash. "" It has some bad acting.",1
"It opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something. Did I have a good time with this movie? And these zombies are fun. But for what they do on their meager budgets, these films should be recommended. No.",1
"Enter Zombie Bloodbath. Well, then again, Zombie Rampage doesn't include that mullet guy, now does it? The first 20 minutes are cluttered with the most awkward - sounding conversations you could imagine. Luckily, not everyone changes with the times. I mean, what makes this one that much more superior? So, Todd Sheets once stated that he considers his 1993, shot - on - video Z - epic, Zombie Bloodbath to be his first feature film. Conversations that let you know that this isn't just a low - budget zombie flick, this is a Z - grade disasterpiece, fella.",1
"Frank Dunlay likewise does well as rugged take - charge army veteran Ralph Walsh. Sheets earns bonus points for keeping the tone grim and nasty to the literal bitter end ( for example, almost all of the main characters wind up becoming zombie chow ). Top thespic honors go to the pretty and perky Kasey Rausch for her winningly spunky portrayal of the resourceful Daria Trumillio.",1
! The plot does seem far - fetched. Sure the acting is laughable at times.,1
I thought that it was well acted and it really made me feel for the characters.,1
"I used to watch this show as a child, and I loved it! I must've been 13 or 14 when it came on... !",1
This movie is worth a see.,1

This is the third film I've seen in which Tom Skeritt (? ) There is noting wrong with that, but as "" River "" demonstrates, some of its taciturn beauty could don'thing but make life richer.

"Cue another song ( big shock there ). Another good moment is when MJ, seeing, Mr Big ( Joe "" what the hell happened to his career at this point? "" He uses this cunning disguise to try and sneak past them, but, for reasons I can't recall right now, they see through it ( oh no! ) and the creepy chase begins again. This is THE most nonsensical film I've ever seen.",1
"Incredible FX, great music and a nice time to enjoy with your kids. But you will find more.",1
"This is, in my opinion, a very good film, especially for Michael Jackson lovers. Yeah. I found it a little out - of - whack compared to the rest of the film. A little weird?",1

"< br / > < br / > Being no fan of M There also should be a few uninterrupted videos. < br / > < br / > My first impression of this film was "" What is this...?

Mr Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon.",1

It also includes some live concert footage.,1
"It's passable. We see Michael walk out of a building, then get shot at by thousands of troops. This movie is great. The stop motion isn't that bad as some would have you believe. MJ and the little girl he is with get caught, then chased... yada yada yada.",1
"Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty? It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! If not, then stay away. Because MJ overheard his plans? Some of it has subtle messages about MJ's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay.",1
"His music, his dancing.. I almost cried. I was a kid.. crazy about Michael Jackson.",1
"The dancing is perfect, and so are the special effects. The first time I saw this "" film "" I loved it. I give it a 10 +! The only thing I could have done without was the spiders.",1

"Later on, Jackson is a 30's style gangster who uses his powers as a crime figure to protect the children. The club is now filled with zoot suiters and swing dancers.",1
It's not a movie.,1
I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved. I recommend one! The Stooges performed very well in this short!,1
Moe calls Curly Senior Cucaracha. In this short the trio are handymen working in a recording studio. Alice Van Doren catches on to the boy scream and hides behind a curtain to help them out. The stooge are pelted out of room. The voice is amazing. They end up using the lucia sexlet until the baritone recognizes them and unplugs it. Excellent.,1
Hilarious pantomime sequences.,1
"The great Gino Corrado is hilarious as a pompous Italian singer terrorized by the Stooges at a society party. A must - see. Most Stoogephiles consider this to be the best Stooges short bar none, and they're right.",1
This was because he was suffering many minor strokes before his big one that ended his career. < br / > < br / > 10 / 10 Be he still managed to pull it off in his last ones!,1
This is an uproar of laughter for any Three Stooges fan to enjoy.,1
"No doubt this is essential viewing for Stooge fans. The trio's mock rendition of the quintet from "" Lucia de L'Amamore "" is especially entertaining. Micro - phonies is a classic Stooge short.",1
"She is good in a number of other shorts, but here she is absolutely brilliant.",1
sometimes it takes a lifetime. < br / > < br / > i'd like to disagree.,1
"For an extra $ 500, she's asked to come and sing at their high - society party that night. The boys are working outside a recording studio when they hear "" the voice of an angel.

"< br / > < br / > Such is the charm of Laurel and Hardy's personas that they elevate average material. The title aptly describes the starring team, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. For SAPS AT SEA has its slow spots. That is as it should be, since the Boys are supposed to be the protagonists in this film. Even in a minor entry like SAPS AT SEA, one can see that Laurel and Hardy were great comedians.",1
Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin show up!,1
Lighten up already. These two were a riot.,1
"All right After they find one they like, we find out that convict Nick Grainger ( Richard Cramer ) has just escaped... The connection here is the year 1940. Ollie doesn't like to go boating so Stan suggests they just rent one that's docked so they wouldn't have to go anywhere. The latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment. That's the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of Hal Roach. This is my third comment here attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams : Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello. I'll mention the significance of the latter later on. I'll stop there and say this was as good a finale for L & H's longtime home as one could hope for.",1
"< br / > < br / > Stan & Ollie are the main focus, however.",1
That's where the surrealness comes in to all of this. I mean Fox.,1
"On that count, "" Saps At Sea "" provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well on it's way to hornomania. The early story at the boys'apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with Stan doing a banana within a banana bit. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. With Oliver Hardy bedeviled by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones, his doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk.",1
"It has just enough time to it to hit the right notes. Unfortunately the goat gnaws the rope until it breaks and the ship sails off. Ollie's nerves finally snap, and he goes on a rampage. This is not going to be a peaceful vacation. < br / > < br / > Stan and Ollie work in a factory that manufactures horns. It's just not as special as the other two.",1
"Stan & Ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of their millions of devoted fans. ) is one of my favorite moments in the oeuvre. The scene where The Boys have to eat their own synthetic meal ( "" Looks good, smells good and it probably tastes good. Eat it. """,1
"In a little town in Montana two brothers grow up. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. Fortunately there is more. In this movie fly - fishing represents life, a little.",1
"This sounds pretty funny, but it isn't. Fortunately, this portion of film actually was well - paced and the very end worked out very well. < br / > < br / > Stan and Ollie work at a horn factory. They had a bit of an edge that all the later films lack. The doctor ( James Finlayson - - in his last film with the team ) recommends an ocean voyage.",1
The clash of the two occurs in a nicely staged ambush scene where the townsmen ride right into a trap.,1
"But it's a fairy tale, and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow. The film has been released on DVD in Germany, with both German and English soundtrack. So I suppose several people would deem "" That Lady in Ermine "" to be outdated and stuffy. It's reasonably funny by bits, it got great stars and it's gorgeous to look at.",1
"But where script and film really come to life is in the battle of the sexes that follows. I was lucky enough to have that experience, borne up on ripples of laughter from all around, and had an immensely good time with this undemanding comedy.",1
"They actually saved men. The shows are all basically identical. By today's standards, the animation is spotty. Maybe it inspired Treasure Planet.",1
He was just that odd at the time. Heck the character Goose actually scared me sometimes. ! It was by far and above my all time favorite cartoon ever.,1
Because it bloody well rocked. I am hoping that more come out. They have released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series so far.,1
How cool is that.,1
Worth seeing.,1
I would willingly spend cash on a DVD GR if available.,1
"How often do you see two legends win Feud of the Year this late in their careers? They were OK matches, but DiBiase deserved better in his final pay per view match. Notice how right after this, he left the WWF so he wouldn't have to job to Razor. < br / > < br / > The Steiners - Heavenly Bodies match was one of the best of the year. Is there a soul out there who didn't like Akeem? Who knew the Bodies could hold their own against one of the best teams ever? But I loved it. I wish Perfect could have won, but Michaels lies down for no one. They just needed a Borga push on pay per view television.",1
"A new crop of talent needed to be pushed. As such there was much anticipation for this match. And this all started with Lex Luger, a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion being given a title shot against Yokozuna. < br / > Razor was able to settle his side of the deal after hitting a Razor's Edge.",1
It was a terrible main event just like every match Luger is in is terrible.,1
"This game is fun and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics. However, that is also a weak point. Could it be Doc Ock? Spider - man has been framed by a mysterious impostor.",1
The DC version is simply incredible.,1
So be warned if you have XP. Rated E ( Contains Violence ). Its a fun clean family game with action and its great for any spiderman fan.,1
Buy today! But still great! This game rocks. He was really planing a symbiote invasion! And last but not least.............. Spidey - Armour! Almost every costume has special abilities! It gives you another health bar!,1
"But Carnage is actually kind of fun to fight. The 4th boss is Venom again. The 5th boss is Mysterio, who I think is the funnest boss to battle in the game. I gave it an 8 out of 10. < br / > < br / > All in all, a very good game. The 8th and final boss is exclusive to the game, never in a comic book or cartoon. Next boss is Carnage, who is, you guessed it, easy to beat. The second boss, Rhino, is also very easy.",1
"Better luck in "" Spiderman 2. "" He does more than spin webs.",1
"< br / > < br / > The three main characters are amazing. Their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war. Possibly, this was his best performance ever.",1
DeNiro and Harris are truly amazing actors. It is interesting how wars effect people. This movie is essentially Deer Hunter 2.,1
Excellent film. Still find it a great Vietnam movie. Not sure why its not higher rated.,1
"All he wants, he says, is for people to leave him alone. Dave reminds Martha several times that Megs is not his friend, just someone he knows. < br / > < br / > Ed Harris delivers a wonderful performance as Dave, who never got over the effects that war had on him. Jacknife is a war movie that is just about as far removed from the war as war movies get.",1
"Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80's. After the war none is a hero. Simp magnificent movie. Everybody is a loser, and this movie is about that simple truth.",1
They can't. I loved this movie. I have no other criticisms. They feel totally apart.,1
"for me, Jacknife is a 10 / 10 i actually really liked this movie. it's not an epic like The Deer Hunter. that was not that big a deal, and doesn't really diminish the film. it's acting in this one that makes it so great.",1
There is a lot of deep thinking in this film. The scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension. A place where you seldom worry about crime. You should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life. Granted it was entertaining but shallow.,1
"And the long - suffering Martha finds her needs tended by Jacknife, too. As David deteriorates his buddy Joseph'Jacknife'Megessey ( Robert De Niro ) returns to the town in an attempt to help his friend. Highly recommended.",1
Just like all of us. Very worthwhile.,1
"8 out of 10? ! This movie is about the complexities of the characters involved. While we are on this subject, "" Casino "" 7.",1
"Be it comedy, drama, tear - jerkers etc. He stinks. It's a genius performance. < br / > < br / > 8 / 10 This guy is an awful actor. He better be a shoe - in for best comedian at every award function.",1
"what did u watch, the subtitle version where majority of jokes are lost in translation? thats what i thought jackass. don't rate movies u don't understand. this move was friggin hilarious!!!",1
"Now i really liked this movie, it was so funny.",1
Its nice but not all that excellent. The comedy's not up to the mark and deserves an award.,1
Paresh Rawail is superb as usual in most of his films. Garam Masala is his funniest film he has made. The three newcomer actresses are average.,1
!,1
"For there is something ritualistic about fly fishing as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes. The Story told is not just a family history, but a history of Life.",1
i would say that if you liked Hungama or Hera Pheri this movie is a must watch.,1
This movie was a fantastic comedy. < br / > < br / > Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars wife and so were all the air hostesses.,1
"In Mexico this movie was aired only in PayTV. I recommended this film a lot, specially in this difficult times for the planet. A true ideas'war : two different Germans, both with faith in there believes.",1
The movie spoke to me.,1
Overall it was very entertaining.,1
Mary defies the youth oriented society with wit and charm. A touch of drama adds 2000 realism.,1
"They are vibrant, beautiful, sexy! Wasn't that the network that carried the "" MTM "" and "" Rhoda "" shows?",1
( During the run of this movie. ) < br / > < br / > Mary goes back to work. The script itself was very well put together. From a non - fan I still enjoyed this little get - together. Rose tries her luck at being a comedian. ( The newer version of MTM theme song doesn't hurt either. ) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles okay but nothing great.,1
"< br / > < br / > Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains.",1
"The Italian'is among the great or near - great films of 1915 that are available today. < br / > < br / > Unfortunately, the cinematographer appears to be unknown. The French serial'Les Vampires'also has its admirers today, although I disagree with them. '",1
THE ITALIAN is an astonishingly accomplished film for its time.,1
"The Italian "" is such a film. Very neat. But times are hard and the family struggles to survive. I loved curtain effect, it was great.",1
"< br / > < br / > Recommended for anyone who has ever suffered the great loss of someone very special, and dearly loved within your life!

A Brother's Promise is a wonderful family film.,1
I felt empathy for characters and cheered at the end.,1
This picture is well worth time. A really great movie and true story.,1
She stole show! She is funny and charming.,1
"But here's a hint. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia. < br / > < br / > This film was sadly shown at three o'clock in the morning on TCM. < br / > < br / > How does Schmeeze work, well that's the gimmick to the whole film. His nearest heir is Donlan.",1

Paul is at the top of his game. The parents fit snugly into their roles. Master flyfisherman. It was hailed as the movie of its generation. Mom takes care of house and home. Dad does the work of the Lord. Have you seen The Graduate?,1
And will admit that I shed quite a few tears throughout.,1
in fifties.,1
"Everything is predictable. As they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts broken and / or mended and love blossoms. < br / > < br / > Skip : Because you've had enough of all this couple - fest nonsense!",1
"Yet this is the case in this Hindi film. There's song, witty dialog, poignant moments, blending and comparison of new ways and tradition.",1
Songs are OK too. Very nicely done. Some of dialogs are quite good. I think the writer director is great.,1
The story was well knitted and dialogs were more or less appropriate. I was waiting to see this movie from a long time.,1
"This is a really well made movie. The rest of the cast and crew too are not mentioned at all. < br / > < br / >'Doghi'is not a Hindi movie. Gauri's father cannot bear the tragic news and suffers a major stroke. Sumitra Bhave has always made sensible cinema and this is my favourite film by her. No aesthetic sunsets in this one. It is at least a thousand times better than'Shaaws ', which is going to the Oscars, from India, this year.",1
Sumitra Bhave's concern and humanism shines through. Doghi is a wonderful movie and Renuka Daftardar is excellent.,1
They have done an excellent job.,1
"Goes way above even any international movie of any repute. If you are not moved by that scene, you don't have a heart.",1
If I'm correct Ralph Bashki did that movie too. Also try Fritz the cat and the NINE Lives of Fritz the Cat. I recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics.,1
"That scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors! That is funny! Finally after hours, they all kneel around the table to say : "" Grace! "" But oatmeal stayed on the plate! The acting is great. and they all leave. I disagree. The sunburn! The drive back home where Jessie Burns ( Emily Lloyd ) decides to go via the train line!",1
The fact that Richard Pryor liked it says as much as well. < br / > < br / > Racist? Done well and well done. I don't know.,1
"Well, this is Coonskin. Pappy's story is told in animation set against live - action background photos and footage. Racist, but good.",1
"< br / > < br / > The movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre. Coonskin "" wants to be more. It's by Ralph Bakshi.",1
Coonskin might be my favorite Ralph Bakshi film. If it were just a blaxploitation flick with inventive animation it could be enough for a substantial feature.,1
Worth watching for Bashki or Blaxploitation film fans. I would have preferred it in full animation but whatever. The film moves on as the Italian mafia want him out. They decide to make names for themselves in Harlem.,1
"I was also fascinated hearing Grover Washington Jr.'s version of "" Ain't No Sunshine "" heard as part of the score. That is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children. That said, I definitely recommend Coonskin to fans of Bakshi and of every form of animation.",1
"hmmm... pretend they never exist? And I also found it an interesting time - capsule view on the black culture in Harlem, New York in the 70's. I had watched this film from Ralph Bakshi ( Wizards, Hey Good Lookin'), one night ago on www. afrovideo.",1
"It's very sloppy and doesn't really say anything. Besides, isn't Bakshi white? 7 / 10. It is an oddity of the cinema, and is very much worth seeing.",1
"Wonderful stuff. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who appear in the film as well.",1
This is not a movie you just watch for fun.,1
"!. Brad Pitt starred in this film before he was really THE!! The Maclean family was comprised of four people, the father, a minister, who was ideologically driven to raise his family properly. Fly fishing!! His wife was God fearing, and dutiful. A stunning realization occurs when some sort of phenomenon takes place!!",1
"Set to Craig Safans'wonderful music score, it's a remarkable picture in terms of aesthetics.",1

"Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother. Some of the smaller ones, I really loved. Stephen King movies are a funny thing with me. I either really love them or I loathe them.",1
"It's got the corny lines, the abrupt ending and a comedic element conveyed by the bumbling policemen. < br / > < br / > Anyway, I liked it. This is not a good movie but I still like it. It really is so bad good.",1
< br / > < br / > I wonder why this game lasted so briefly. I even had the home version!,1

"Of Course, Superman AND Batman. I believe the goal was to get it as close to the comic character than the movie persona. After seeing the "" Batman Dead End "" short, I didn't know what to really expect from World's Finest. Hope more like this are made. He stands around with a goofy look on his face that simply says, "" slap me. "" And line delivery seems to be a problem with him.",1
"This is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like! Even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts. ! Mr. Collora... We need more directors like you! The attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. I don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to DVD, I would never get tired of watching it. No more "" Batman & Robin "" fiasco, or Hulk, Daredevil etc.",1
"Throughout, the cinematography is solid. It's... not good. The acting is perhaps the most evident. The editing is spot - on. Iconic.",1
"Rarely seen, the game show did not survive past one single season.",1
"it's a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along. i won't go int to the storyline here. for me, World'finest is a 7 / 10 everyone is well cast.",1
"Sure the CGI effects aren't perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. BUT, this was made on a shoestring budget and for a fan film this is incredible. Great job. < br / > < br / > As far as this film goes, I could easily pick it apart.",1
"Supes is toned no doubt but not bulk. Superman flies through the sky. I'm sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film Collora and company, even O'Hearn could deliver a decent film. The suit Kent wore masked his size. Now this may not be just O'Hearn's fault, Collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction. I'd probably pay to see a film, if ever made, and would be sure to catch it on television. < br / > < br / > All in all it was a good trailer. Evidently the harness and rigging supporting O'Hearn must have been located on his lower torso. Certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of Hollywood lately.",1

"I even found it a pretty laughable thing to watch. < br / > < br / > So the movie is one big tease, even more than standards everyday real movie trailers. It has some impressive shots but also a couple of lame ones, mainly Superman flying sequences. But really the better and more spectacular moments really compensate for this. Clark Bartram reprises his Batman role well again and Kurt Carley seemed like an awesome Lex Luth The trailer will hype you all up for nothing. It was obvious that the guy was just standing at a moving car, with a camera aimed at him from an angle below. World's Finest "" is an unique project.",1

One thing that was not explored and hasn't been was Travis's hyperactive sex drive. He was a hero at the Alamo to be sure, but his career before the Alamo was that of a scoundrel.

"Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background.",1
"Along with a nice twist at the end its a cool package overall. Great job! The score, though not bad, gave film almost a music video feel. I walk away from this very satisfied. It just felt a little dated, not adding anything to further the storyline.",1
Worth watching more than once! I was especially enjoyed the thrill of the film's suspense. The piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot. The Cure uses voice over to create an intense mood.,1
"So the energy pushes audience back from the emotion of the film. What really impress me are the camera work and music. But this film, directorial debut from a young director, handled very well on screen. Way to go, Ryan!",1

The Cure is an amazing film... Eric Giovon did an amazing job.,1

James Arness is a great actor and he showed it here. The writing was top - notch.,1
But all in all a excellent movie.,1
"This one is an excellent addition to genre. And another recent score of his, for Catch Me if You Can, shows still more wit and sophistication.",1
"But time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end. Last but not the least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri could not be better. My vote is nine. I hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen.",1

"Antonioni seems to be out - of - date ; a flawed genius. The real sounds in contrast are from non - conformists. He knew what he was doing. allure of the film still remains. When I saw the film for the first time in the early 1970s, I was in awe of this film.",1

"What does that REALLY mean? Just who IS the "" revolutionary ""?",1
They were beautiful but inexperienced. It would have been so much better with proper actors! Why?,1
"The lead pair are excellent and it is shameful that they took so much flak for the film's perceived failure. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned highly explosive ending.",1
"< br / > < br / > Let's be honest. Seriously, these straight and sober reviews of ZP miss the point. You can't get anything out of this movie in a straight frame of mind.",1
It captures well significant moment in time.,1
"So what do we see? Events. We see people arguing, driving, and inevitably, escaping.",1
"Happily I'm no longer in such a minority. ( Still do, it has aged very well. )",1
"The film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life. In my point of view a film to remember. ZP is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement. During the 60'and 70 ', young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change.",1
< br / > < br / > The print I saw runs 1 hour 50 minutes. Antonioni was very daring to do this. I suspect there is quite a bit of restored footage in this print. It's time for a full evaluation of the film. This time Frechette did not bother me.,1
It was perhaps this same feeling that the film sought to explore in the youth it exemplified. Even the anti - establishment students are as inauthentic as gov't they rebel against.,1
"Not so. < br / > < br / > The two protagonists come from vastly different environments. It is a colourful intermission in a colourless landscape. In a not - so - obscure symbolism, there is Antonioni's opinion on the hippies. Mark from the "" rebel "" youths, Daria from an estate agency corporation.",1
"Perhaps it's true that, like In the end, I realised perhaps it was better that way, because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one. The dance between the airplane flying over and the girl's car makes for a series of great shots. < br / > < br / > The first part seems a lot more fragmentary, which is not a bad thing, it just requires more of an effort to follow. I have to admit I have always found it difficult to watch an Antonioni film from start to finish at the first try, and even for this one, I ended up watching it in three parts on repeated occasions. It just leaves you in awe. When it gets to the desert scenes, all efforts are repaid in full.",1
It's politics too upfront and ridiculous. She - took - her - time... To Live. I saw ZP when it was first released and found it a major disappointment. Its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey'60s.,1
"But. When this film was made, the hippie thing had gone mainstream. is a part of a "" reality group "". ), by diving down, almost hitting car. Yet it has something to say, and it is said really beautifully.",1
"< br / > < br / > Even so, I like this film. This film has a powerful philosophical ending. And the desert badlands are beautiful.",1
"I really can't see why. Obvious hippie - era, dated and easy symbolism and all. Made two years before I was born, Zabriskie Point was supposed to have been Michelangelo's great American epic. For my taste, Zabriskie didn't have a tedious minute in it. Well, I loved it. He is virtually unsurpassed in this skill.",1
"Also, Antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful ever to grace the screen. This is the film in Antonioni's middle period that most critics dismiss quickly, as a'flawed'look at 60s American youth culture / politics. Well worth seeking out, and one of those key films of the 60s that demands a DVD restoration / release.",1
"Perhaps that was point. "", but this was one of them. A director's job is to see "", Antonioni once stated. There aren't too many times when I see a film and go, "" huh, what?",1
"It is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list. For me, this movie fit like a glove.",1
"I know, I know - I can legitimately be called an Antonioni fanatic. However, there is not better awful film, if you catch my drift. However, other people tend to get annoyed at a loose narrative. Well, that's not exactly true.",1
"< br / > < br / > At last the audience could understand "" Zabriskie Point. "" < br / > < br / > The audience was held spellbound as the film unfolded its artisty on the huge panoramic screen. < br / > < br / > Antonioni's compositions are created for the Cinemascope landscape.",1
Antonioni really showed some'cojones'when he had this movie made. < br / > < br / > An unexpected gem.,1
"< br / > < br / > All in all, this was treat. It is also backed by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer. However, I will maintain some sense of dignity. I would just like to state that this may be biased, as I am a producer on the film. A rare gem, among many jewels.",1
"I have to say that it was a lot of fun. There is a lot of heart in this movie, a lot of wit to. Last November, I had a chance to see this film at the Reno Film Festival. The movie does a great job of giving us people we canympathize with.",1
"The themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant. This happened quite by accident, with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television.

"And you don't have to ride bikes or even like them to enjoy it. This gentle comedy will warm the cockles of your heart and have you laughing out loud. At last! John Ivay's film is a psychoactive tale of discovery, dressed in biker gear.",1

"He moved to France in his early thirties and was influenced by French composers. If Saura hadn't done anything like this before, Iberia would be a milestone. His "" Iberia "" suite is an imaginative synthesis of Spanish folk music with the styles of Liszt, Dukas and d'Indy.",1
Wow! < br / > < br / > The subject is also so fascinating. You can tell that they are a close family. I wish we could all have that experience. Turn up the volume here! Imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating. In fact this would make a perfect DVD to demo your system. It is about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. The script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son.,1
To create a good versus evil battle like never before.,1
"However, it'so bad that it's funny.",1
"If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it. It is quite possibly the best worst movie ever. It is a true gem. You won't regret it!",1

"2004. 10. Thanks to all for reading my comment. When I saw this movie first, it was long ago on VHS - Video. The music in the background had some kind of magic. They called this movie "" KOR the conquerer "". I did like this movie, because it was funny and excitingly. Both of them did their job very good.",1
This film gets 10 for pure entertainment value! ! 79 a night in my local store!,1
"His wife, Georgia, died by suicide. Afterwards, we would have a variety of characters. How can we ever forget San Fernando Red? Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue?",1

"That's why I recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema, good music, good dance, great art. Ibéria shows an even better Saura, dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music.",1
"Very nice work. If you haven't read Othello, see this. If you haven't heard Othello, see this.",1
"Laurence Fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career. It deals with his favorite topics : crookedness, envy, deceitfulness and jealousy. That was, of course, way before I saw this.",1
"I give it a marginal recommendation. Some might say this film is overly Iago - centric, but I disagree. The acting, as stated previously, is very good. In this film, she might as well not be added at all. Branagh plays Iago better than I've seen the character played in film or on stage.",1
"SUrprisingly, he didn't direct it but played a role. not that there was a British vs. American issue about it. My college professor says that Othello may be Shakespeare's finest drama. IT's just worth watching. Apart from other Shakespeare tragedies, this is dealt with issue of race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time.",1
"This Irishman, always brilliant, cleanly steals the show away. Nice to see the views of Venice, too.",1
"< br / > < br / > Second, Fishburne is the first black actor to play Othello in a film. Why should a Black actor be the Black man on the stage? 2 Why is this important? 3 Certainly in Shakespeare's day they used black face just as they used boys to make girls. Students often ask me why I choose this version of Othello. Both Orsen Wells and Anthony Hopkins did fine film versions, but they were white men in black face. Fishburne's depiction is therefore classically tragic. Perhaps then, the reason is same.",1
Every effort to film Shakespeare ought really to be celebrated. It is not an easy thing to do.,1
"( Even Shakesspeare, after all, can be improved upon, now and again - - and if that be treason, make most of it! Perhaps this explains why his acting, in this beautifully edited film, comes over as so believable and so powerful.",1
"But as a whole, I liked the film and especially Desdemona crying in dying scene.",1
To my surprise Othello was great! The language somehow breaks the time barrier. but perhaps it is the actors who really do that.,1
"Whatever the reason, I thought it was pitch perfect. This movie made me happier than I've been for a while.",1
"Due to his insane jealousy, he's out for revenge. Othello, the classic Shakespearen story of love, betrayal, lies, and tragedy. It's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you've read it. But when the king finds out that Othello snuck off with his daughter, Desdemona, the king is infuriated, but excepts it.",1
"The director had a great cast, and no one offered bad performance. displays his usual talent for Shakespeare in this movie, he is somewhat marginalized. On the other hand, maybe the did just meet - - - like Romeo and Juliet. Although Kenneth Brannagh ( sp? ) The characters of Cassio and Emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they, like Iago, seem more crucial to the plot. Also, Othello and Desdemona need more time together.",1
Do watch it. < br / > < br / > I don't think they could have chosen a better Othello.,1
"< br / > < br / > A good film, a great cast, go see. Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino. Why?",1
Dennehy is a master of taking over movie. Kick back and enjoy.,1
I can't believe this was rated so low. The critics are dumb. But this is better than that. I like this movie. Why does everyone hate this movie so much.,1
"It had the underlining of a stupid comedy, but indeed had an actual plot as well. A real winner, in my mind. Take my advice and rent it. Much like the hit comedy, Elf, in fact. = D It had a few serious moments, sandwiched between hilarity.",1
Maybe this isn't a movie for you.,1
"Don't avoid this movie because of the reviews. Yes, but they still make it work! If you don't like it... well, now you know. Was the script more fitting for a 30 minute sitcom?",1
The story built. Good team.,1
< br / > < br / > Claire Danes shines like the star she is in this movie. Especially a romantic fantasy.,1
"Yes, it was a fairly simple story, but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way. It's wittier, wackier, and an offbeat, enjoyable gem. < br / > < br / > This film was a dark comedy gem, and I'm not sure what people expect. < br / > < br / > Remember this people ; Most times, Popular doesn't equal Good.",1
Cult classics are nearly impossible to predict. < br / > < br / > Why do I love Envy?,1
"I was cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie. Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors. < br / > < br / > The plot is really simple. If you don't, run away from this movie. Absolutely hate it. Everything else is plain odd.",1
"Well they've both had 7 movies, 1 TV series, and 1 upcoming film.",1
"The list goes on and on. There's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes, and Robert Englund's cameos are short, pointless and corny in a sort of a Bob Saget on America's Funniest Home Videos kind of way. < br / > < br / > If you're looking for something that'll scare you stay away.",1
"i love this show, and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very enjoyable. but, i love this show so much. the acting can at time be also a little crumby.",1
Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. The episodes are packed with drama and blood.,1
It may have been loosely connected to the movies. But oh well. i heard it was canceled due to protesting parents. Poltergeist the legacy : I'm not so sure. This is one horror movie based TV show that gets it right.,1
"Not original, but still creepy and fun.... < br / > < br / > Even so, some of the episodes were great. < br / > < br / > One episode had Jeffrey Combs ( Re - Animator, etc. ) as a motivated pizza merchant with a tasty new secret ingredient.",1
But the real power in the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.,1
"The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to Ryan. He runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing. It is lame but bear with it, at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature. If they < br / > < br / > Ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance. Home Room "" like "" Zero Day "" and "" Elephant "", was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings.",1
It's worth seeing again.,1
"There's some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast. So I don't ruin it for you, I'll be very brief.",1
Dennis Cooper completely his residency in internal medicine - so he definitely applied his knowledge / experience to the film and that is greatly apparent. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival as well. I was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues. The film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time.,1
The story is something that really keeps you watching.,1
"But eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more. She's also getting over a divorce. All Kira Reed fans MUST see this. They go into a corner room and they do it. Remember kids, safe sex ).",1
This movie is different.,1
"But this time, she plays a cute tomboy very well. Cinematography was average. < br / > < br / > Very funny and well - done. I enjoyed this film very much.",1
"Sex is not always required in a good romantic movie. How he became a father was revealed in next scene, which brings smiles to the audience.",1
"Her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character. Like every tale, it has some short of morality. I have to give at least 9 / 10 stars for this. And i was right. She literally shines in this movie.",1
"Did I mention it's a romantic comedy? Overall, a fun, cute movie.",1
"That has, however, by no means affected negatively my opinion of the film. And - what a delightful surprise!",1
I'd watch it again... with a girl. There is a fair balance between the two.,1
He is actually female character's age.,1
"I liked him a lot better here than in highly overrated "" Volcano High "". Not bad. The biggest applause should go to the two leads.",1
Did you ever wonder how far one movie could go?,1
This film is like marmite. You either love it or you hate it. If you go into this film expecting a low budget slasher you'll probably hate it.,1
"You may just be able to see it for the stand alone, cult classic that it is. I don't think that is is possible for anybody to get bored watching either of these two.",1

fantastic tacky fun this film is absolutely hilarious.,1
"The lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny. I gave it a 7 out of 10, this is a great movie for dates and couples in late hours. I truly hope there is a sequel and I'll be right there to watch it on whatever cable channel does it. Jack Frost is one that not only delivers but is actually one of the best that I've seen in a long time. The scene where the snowman is with the teenage girl is truly classic in B - movie, horror film fashion.",1
What was that all about?,1

"There ' The snow reminds you more of flocking or Styrofoam peanuts than actual snow. < br / > < br / > 4. < br / > < br / > 3. She talks him into breaking into sheriff's house, of all places, in order to get it on. The lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving.",1
"This fantasy adventure ( with sci - fi elements ) was the best one I've seen since "" Return of King "" ( not that I am comparing the two at all ). This remarkable film can be summed up very easily. First of all, while the comparisons to "" Princess Bride "" are inevitable, it's almost futile to do so.",1
7 out of 10.,1
It is a beautiful thing.,1
"treatment! The straight - faced delivery of scenes actually makes it FUNNY! C'mon, how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously?",1
"Everyone, or at least everyone with any taste, has dreamed of seeing a snowman going around killing people, even if they won't admit it. Easily the greatest low budget horror film of all time.",1
"Back then, it was one of my favourite films. ( Also, I believe that film starts off slowly. )",1
i also love anyone else who loves it. i love you.,1
"It's an unusual story that is fun to watch. What a great gem this is. In fact, the movie won an Oscar for these effects!",1
"This is an old fashioned, wonderfully fun children's movie with surely the most appealing novice witch ever. This actor was previously cast as the children's father in the movie Mary Poppins. Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to London on their flying bed. Some have been critical, but the movie features excellent special effects. Meanwhile, they must also deal with a shady character called the Bookman and his associate, Swinburne. All in all, the story is enchanting family entertainment. Miss Price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life.",1
A great movie.,1
"please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie! There is so much humor, but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes. Other big names make outstanding roles.",1
( For the time ).,1
You will not be disappointed. Family fun.,1
"However, Eglantine missed her final exams to becoming an accomplished witch. Great family entertainment and we need more films like this today.",1
"I saw this when on The Wonderful World of Disney as a kid, so I didn't recall much of it. Also, the subject manner was a bit dark seeing as it was set during WW2.",1
"Their chemistry was just brilliant as well. 8 / 10 Bethany Cox All in all, a lovely film, that is hardly ever on.",1
"The animation is delightful, much better than Pixar which I find grotesque. It does not matter he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice. A warm happy film and its a wonder its not done on stage. I loved the marching song of home army.",1
Go to the video store and rent Bedknobs and Broomsticks NOW. It's a terrifically good musical for the whole family so what are you waiting for?,1

"I cannot think of anyone more suited to the role. Fabulous, fantastic, probably Disney's best musical adventure. < br / > < br / > A great film that still holds up today! He was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays. !",1
And those kids have to deal with a world of magic. Ms. Lansbury didn't get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing. And they won an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in that department for this film.,1
"appear with Scottish and local female auxiliaries in costume. Ironically it was Owen's final role. Like MARY POPPINS BEDKNOBS has David Tomlinson in it, in a role wherein he learns about parenting. It is a fine mixture of live action and animation.",1
"< br / > < br / > I like the black cat. Both have their own magic and a magical woman. Both have similar settings in London. < br / > < br / > This movie is often compared to "" Mary Poppins "" with a reason. It's pretty cool. < br / > < br / > David Tomlinson is great in this film once again. Portobello Road "" is nice too.",1
10 that it really is. The movie made ever so much more since.,1
"The acting is outstanding, the songs are compelling, they get deep into your head and you can't help but singing along. We got it and have watched it repeatedly since ; in fact we've rented it several times since.",1

? She doesn't want them but reluctantly takes them in. It sure doesn't hold up as an adult! This place in England during 1940. And her and the kids travel around on a bed with the help of a magical bedknob. There's also a trip to the Isle of Naboombu which is run by animated animals. and she seeks down the head Professor Browne ( David Tomlinson ). ( OK - - I realize this is a family film but - - College of Witchcraft??,1
The previews don't do this movie justice! The villains are completely wicked and the heroes are refreshingly pure. This is the epitome of fairytale!,1

"The most famously prescient moment being episode 19 of series 5, which aired on the eve of the second Gulf War.",1
7 hours. Recommended for those with an interest in India.,1
We have much to learn from it. The movie perfectly catches a particular time and place with pinpoint accuracy.,1
"If any style of film could be called my "" guilty pleasure "", it'd be this generic fantasy type. Stardust "" is good stock fantasy, the likes of which one should expect from Neil Gaiman ( or Gaiman adaptation, as it were ).",1
The best movie I've seen years.,1
It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story.,1

A great film. < br / > < br / > It's great to see good movies on indian themes.,1
"< br / > < br / > Gustad Noble is anything but that ; he is a middle - aged Parsi bank employee in Bombay in the 1970s. < br / > < br / > However, I was somewhat prepared for this, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. At the same time, it is a fascinating, and, I would assume, accurate, portrayal of middle - class, urban life in India at the time.",1
"Then, he says something like, "" Boy, was I stupid! "" There are two parts that stay with me.",1
Sam ( Flash Gordon ) Jones was a perfect Spirit. I'm sorry it didn't materialize into a series. The 1986 TV movie of The Spirit was a pilot for a possible series.,1
"We say, < br / > < br / > The film is a sincere attempt to put Eisner's world on screen. The left over screen play became the serial, THE MASKED MARVEL, one of Republic's best. The casting of Denny Colt / The Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was really quite well done. That pretty well describes both THE SPIRIT and his creator, Mr. Will Eisner, the true creative genius in the comics. This can't make up its mind if it's serious or not! """,1
This is where this movie could have been a lot better. Gertrude Michael however provides a bit of spark. He also plays a cameo as the conductor.,1
"Undoubtedly the movie's most popular song, it is heard no less than four times.",1
"Another encounter involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs. The story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even building up strong suspense. My guess it will find big success on video. Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - tough on the inside, and shall we say in touch with his feminine side. Lots of bad chasing the good.",1
Its a fun movie of the sort they don't make any more. During the opening night of the Vanties a woman is found dead on the catwalk above the stage. There is only one good song.,1
"A very enjoyable film, providing you know how to watch old musicals / mysteries. Is the murderer found out before the curtain falls? As a musical, it's no Busby Berkley or Freed unit, but it can boost the classic "" Coctails for two "" and the weird "" Sweet Marijuana "".",1
This murder mystery with musical numbers is long on atmosphere and character but rather short on suspense and plausibility.,1
What happened? MacLaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective. This rates a 7. And try to spot Lucy in the chorus. I still have enormous issues with the editing however. I can understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot.,1
"This was very obviously pre - Code. Worth a look for any film buff interested in this sort of thing. P. S. As long - time Louisiana resident, I like noting when someone was born here as Carlisle was a New Orleans native.",1
And I believe this is one of the only early musicals to feature such a mix - - and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination.,1
"Two murders occur on the opening night of "" Earl Carroll's Vanities "" ( one on - stage! A bizarre and bawdy camp classic highly recommended! For no Probably faulty direction. Victor McLaglen is something new in cops. The murder mystery is good with the exception of the denouement, which is pretty flat. Just by way of suspense, a cop threatens to stop the show every few minutes.",1
"< br / > < br / > A must stroll down Memory Lane. And Duke Ellington doesn't hurt either. Vanities is so horrifically anti - female that it's delicious. There are moments in the film that are so dreadful, your teeth ache.",1
Quite the cast.,1
His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. The fusion is highly entertaining. Truly he is coming into his own. The cast does a fine job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style.,1
This movie is wonderful. < br / > < br / > This movie is really a double MUST SEE one...!!!! Magnificent!,1
The film is well - written and I enjoyed this it immensely. I can only regard the current film on its own merits.,1
Fay Grim acts as a sequel to Hartley's'Henry Foole'from 1998. This film will be no exception to that rule.,1
"There are so many nuances in the film making and writing that I crave to see in films, but never do. The last five minutes of the film were perfect. And well, Parker Posey, who could complain? The scene in which Fool and Jalal were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional. All that aside, the film, I thought, was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me.",1
"< br / > < br / > Hartley, however, is simply riding on that fragmentary idea. Available within them is information that could concede the safety of the United States. His plot, though complex and labyrinthine, true to the form of spy film, it seems as if to be entirely capricious. In the original Henry Fool, Posey played a simple woman leading a very simple life.",1
"He is convincing and delightful as Agent Fulbright. I'd buy it. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. It is more drama and intrigue... a mystery, of sorts. It seems to be missing. Henry Fool surprised me. I'll watch it often.",1
"< br / > < br / > I consider "" Henry Fool "" my least favorite of Hartley's films. Her extravagant naiveté is perfect for Hartley's direction. < br / > < br / > This is the epitome of a "" stand alone "" sequel. < br / > < br / > Aside from Posey's brilliance, it was wonderful to see Elina Lowensohn, one of my favorite actresses, again. < br / > < br / > This film erupts into a highly relevant international intrigue story, explaining political situations in Afganistan. I honestly don't remember it very well - I think the character himself was so despicable I found it tedious. This is never suspected at beginning. The complexity of this film's development is unparalleled.",1
"Fay, the sister of the notorious Nobel prize - winning smut poet Simon Grim, still loves Henry Fool.",1
Fay Grim is a true example of what I call a completed puzzle film.,1
"Who knows but Henry. And he does so to the extreme here. And that's the case with FAY GRIM, the sequel to Henry Fool. Infusing equal parts mystery / espionage with wispy comedy seems to be his forte. Secrets weapons research or paths to terrorists? < br / > < br / > Hal Hartley obviously loves to play with themes.",1
"Henry is a thinly veiled devil, first visiting Simon as a modern Faust, etc. In Henry Fool, the object is the memoirs... That is, in a philosophical sense, what Fay Grim is all about. Without understanding how tragic Henry's character is, much of the quality of Fay Grim's plot and story is lost.",1
"I anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly cliché, but I was completely wrong! Her acting was fantastic, I couldn't even tell that she was American. It kept my interest the entire time and I will be buying the DVD when it comes out! Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked her as the snippy mother in Hairspray. < br / > < br / > Overall, it was funny ( but not slap - stick at all!",1
"Alright, this film is the representation of several things. < br / > < br / > These two leads are nearly entirely opposite, and they are quite that on a social level. She seems quite mysterious, but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom. One student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries.",1
It's sequel.,1
"But this is where the subtlety of Fay Grim lies. While Simon learned to control his mind, Fay learns to control her emotion. Henry Fool was a complete movie from start to finish, and needed no sequel.",1
< br / > < br / > Also starring Jeff Goldblum. Simon ( James Urbaniak ) is still in jail. But this is no ordinary toy.,1
The supporting cast is stellar. The downside?,1
"< br / > < br / > This film is very heavy in plot, which keeps the film moving. To those who've never seen Henry Fool, I wouldn't worry. It somehow works and doesn't work at the same time. Mass media in No Such Thing, Religion in the Book of Life and now Terrorism in Fay Grim. I have mixed feelings about the film and Hartley's later films in general.",1
"< br / > < br / > I wont even try to tell you the plot.. in a sense, completely ridiculous. The supporting actors commit to it as well. ( I resisted temptation to turn off the DVD twice ). She's at once touching, funny, cunning. In the end, it offers something that defies description.",1
"I just hope I don't have to wait 10 more years for it. The plot, however, is completely different. """,1
I can't wait for the third part in this story! Syrianna : of side note - Mark Cuban Exec. < br / > < br / > This film is very funny. What can be in store for the future of Fay and the Fool family...??,1
"As the poet prospers, Henry declines. Everyone wants his rambling, incoherent journal which just may contain coded secrets that could destabilize nations and economies. Nor do we. He's either dead or in hiding from agents and authorities of many countries. A pitch for Harold and Maude's Ghost would have been quoted higher odds of ever making it to a screen. Nothing special about any of the characters or the story.",1
I'll be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 ('Henry Grim '? ) in 2017.,1
"It's simply magical. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. I won't spoil it for you. < br / > < br / > It's a really good story.",1
"He has never been better. Although that may be redundant. As Agent Fulbright, Jeff Goldblum is a master of wit and sarcasm, in a role that seems tailored to his talents. What began as dark comedy morphs into romantic drama, and the transition is masterful. Slow pacing gives way to breathtaking action, and we are sucked right into vortex. And Liam Aiken is Fay's oversexed 14 year - old son.",1
< br / > < br / > The odds were long. com.,1

"Rogers sings the catchy "" Let Yourself Go "" and later does a solo tap - dance to same tune. Fred and Ginger win a dance contest by doing an energetic routine to another reprise of "" Let Yourself Go "". Quintessential Astaire and Rogers.",1
"Plus, although the music is by Irving Berlin, the songs just don't seem as memorable. However, despite this, I was a bit disappointed in this outing. And, as a result, it's a lot harder to like him or want to see them get together in the end of the film. Good but far from great.",1
"If Hollywood is to be believed, being in the the Navy is nothing but a bludge. After Bake returns from several years of duty in the Navy, he finds Sherry as dance hostess in an unsophisticated San Francisco ballroom.",1
This commences the second romantic storyline between Bilge and Connie.,1
Excellent art direction and score. 79 / 100.,1

Her performance is accidentally sabotaged by But what does a plain - looking woman do? Astaire and Randolph Scott are in the Navy. ( Choreographed by Hermes Pan. ) It's tough enough for a homely guy. Everything works out fine. Did Margaret Thatcher?",1
"And you know what? I needn't have feared, the film version is bl * * dy awesome. As a massive fan of fantasy in general, and of the works of Neil Gaiman * in particular *, I've been looking forward to this film so avidly, so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that I can scarcely believe it's finally here.",1
Never seem to tire of it.,1

Meanwhile, Astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dancing partner left off. It is truly to be treasured and watched again and again. Rogers is vivacious, and a youthful Astaire is a dynamo.",1
"This really is a great movie. He adds to this movie, he doesn't detract from it. Randy is in my top ten all time favorites list.",1
"Especially such a shallow and inconstant man. ). From a modern sensibility, it's sometimes hard to watch older films. How can you not like sailors dancing with each other?! The last dance scene "" Face the Music "" with the beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful. < br / > < br / > Apart from that subplot, I did like the movie.",1
"Connie and Sherry inherit a steamer from their father, but they need money to keep it afloat. He is partnered with not Irene Dunne ( who understandably turned down this follow - up ) but Harriet Hilliard. However, they go a bit more downscale for this 1936 outing, the fifth of their ten musicals together. Romance blooms for both couples.",1
Answer : In spades.,1
WWII was still a few years away. The man was effortless in motion.,1
"Scott is rarely ever interesting. The dance is just fantastic. "" I like Hilliard.",1
"Great versatility and artistry. She makes a good contrast with Ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film. Here she is touching without being sentimental. Pretty good though. She had a varied career, becoming the more famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie.",1
"Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide "" in the closet "" to protect his "" reputation ""! So on that note, I highly recommended Stardust. Boy, is she so convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her age - ugly makeup in the beginning and end!",1
"1936 was the most prolific year for Astaire and Rogers. Extras include a featurette, theatrical trailer and short subject, but oddly no audio commentary. Grain is still present. The audio is Mono but very nicely balanced.",1
"This is just a great, fun, lovely film.",1
"She also sings "" But Where Are You? "" Great music by Irving Berlin. One of the best of the Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers films. Just gorgeous. Luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance.",1
Their dancing on this one is absolute magic. That's right Ozzie and Harriet.,1
"Most of the A - R movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories. I can't find her, but I know she's in here. No surprise than Ozzie fell for this beauty. Although she had that short early'30s hairstyle, I recognized her voice right away.",1
"The plot intellect is about as light as feather down. Everyone and everything is once again just so enjoyable. < br > < br / > Rating : 8. But with Astaire and Rogers, we just know it's got to work.",1
"If world were truly like this film, bring on that black hole, we're ready. What hath the Marshall Plan and the EU wrought? Soulless suburbia that I thought only existed in Arizona and Florida thrives in Lower Austria. I confess to only watching the first half hour ( for now ). Oh no! Ulrich Seidl must be a very strong man.",1

"). Probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong - due to good visualization. The episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women, mostly categorized by age group. There is a middle - aged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a ( violent ) master.",1
< br / > < br / > A very pessimistic movie. And you SEE the people. Maybe you'll end up like them. I guess Hundstage is such a movie.,1
"Hundstage sticks a finger right into your brain and scratches your mind all over. Kind of like Tarkovsky films, but different in a way. I, myself, can't say I had a lot of fun watching it. Most viewers would most likely give either a 10 or a 1 to this film. But this one's an outstanding piece on its own.",1
"Without any glitter, and most disturbingly, without any hope. I sure do know such people. Trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, picked out to attract audience. And at the low end of the oppression chain, mostly women. < br / > < br / > A movie showing this as brutally as Hundstage is surely tough to face, but having to endure such lives, is even tougher. However it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles I fear, as subtitles can´t transport accentuation. Somewhere the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place, somewhere hopes have to shatter.",1

And a mentally ill woman keeps hitching rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car! It is a thought - provoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole.,1
I had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichéd from here to breakfast. I'm also a huge Sci - Fi / Fantasy fan.,1
This effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories but also by actors playing. A special parochialism and arrogance typical for Vienna are also very well portrayed. So real is the visceral feeling of the viewer... Hundstage is no exception.,1
"It's like CRASH tripping on a bad dose of heroin, but not really.",1
"One important point of reference here is Rainer Werner Fassbinder. I think the answer would be that I was watching a horror film, but one that defies or even reverses the conventions of said genre. I had to ask myself, what was it about the film that made me feel like I did?",1
This film is great.,1
The audience reaction was mixed. This film shows humanity at its most desperate and pathetic. The working title there was'Dog Days '. < br / > < br / > This film isn't for the faint of heart. And why should he?,1
"Because the film is not and easy one to watch. And rightly so. It is a very cruel movie, not for everyone's taste.",1
"once they reached "" land of milk and honey "", why didn't they just stay there? Risk death for a cow?? Better them than I!",1
They had such a hard life. In search of grass for their animals. It is sink or swim and climb or die.,1
"< br / > < br / > Just watching that was incredible, but there was much more to come. The other "" bank "" of the river was very steep - I'm guessing about a 60 degree rise. Yes, barefoot.",1
It took them a week just to cross a river. ! I think it absolutely incredible for it's time!,1
"I didn't want it to end, I wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of Stormhold and get to meet Tristan and Yvaine What can I say. This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and all I can say is Wow. How often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that doesn't just come off as another cheap Princess Bride knockoff. < br / > < br / > Then there is the story? It manages to be Familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time.",1
This was soul - provoking!,1
Fantastic documentary of 1924.,1
But what shots they are!,1
"The version that I saw had fascinating Iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film. The migration theme is used again in People of the Wind ( 1976 ) and in Himalaya ( 1999 ). To make sure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place, a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the end. Off - duty entertainment by desert police becomes a "" policeman's ball. "" The producers went on to make docu - drama Chang ( 1927 ) and the totally commercial King Kong ( 1933 ). Recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into - - and then highly recommended for them. A more drastic contrast could not be imagined. Raging river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water do in fact die.",1
A fine film.,1
Some of the scenes are hilarious like with the birth of an alien creature.,1
"I actually enjoyed this quite a bit. < br / > < br / > This film. Maybe it added a bit of polish to the film, or not.

"For a small scale movie, the costumes, sets, and camera work were quite nice, also. Since Parker is straight but the price is right, he decides to pretend that he is gay. You will like what you see, I know it. Sam is lovely, intelligent and very desirable. But, poor Parker.",1
Sam's gay friend was hysterical.,1
7. The house was loaded ( appr. I went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film.,1
And it succeeds wonderfully. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The critical reaction is kind of blah.,1
"Every time I watch it, the ending makes me cry. I absolutely loved this movie.",1

"These are low - life bad guys. Some truly classic lines, and a fun twist at the end.",1
"OK, with more profanity. What a grand and pleasant surprise. The actual heist made me laugh so hard I was crying. Best $ 5 I've spent in ages.",1
< br / > < br / > Very well done guys.,1
"Sounds simple? < br / > < br / > Welcome to Collinwood is nothing short of superb. Great fun throughout, with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker. I saw this gem of a film at Cannes where it was part of the directors fortnight.",1
"I was not expecting much from this movie. It was hot and I was tired. The actors were fabulous, the pace was perfect, and ending was magical.",1
I believe they have funniest roles in the entire movie. The Russo Brothers did a fine job directing. It is great slapstick.,1
A.,1
The movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling.,1
William H. Macy plays Riley. Gabrielle Union plays his love interest Michelle. Sam Rockwell is Pero. This is a highly entertaining flick. Isaiah Washington is Leon. I certainly recommend it.,1
He made a role of his life in this movie! But real star is actually Guzman.,1
The edgy parts are edgy. Here's why. < br / > < br / > There isn't a bad performance in the film.,1
8 / 10. Things haven't changed much.,1

I believe they have funniest roles in the entire movie. The Russo Brothers did a fine job directing. It is great slapstick.,1
Fun.,1
The script was amazingly written. It wasn't what I was expecting at all. But this movie caught me off guard. And it wasn't just the cast that did it for me.,1
"and all others. I don't like all movies were audience eventually likes and cheers for thieves. Because of one difference. This fact goes beyond comedy into the soul of that criminals. Toto with his pants. Everyone gave their part of brilliance from this movie cast. Cosimo with his line : "" Your mother's a whore! "" This movie is remake of Italian comedy "" I Soliti Ignoti "". Riley with his little baby and wife in jail. It is mostly securing their future in very humble way.",1

These guys are anything but the Usual Suspects! This is probably his best performance since Fargo.,1
"There's an air of inevitable catastrophe looming throughout the movie, of primitive degenerate tide ( embodied by Sharikov ) sweeping the lives of the finest minds advancing humanity in their areas... trailers and posters : ). But I join in regret that ALL the meaning in today's teenager's talk may be expressed by cusswords.",1
Superb acting.,1
So now my favorite book and movie have the same title. Why can't we find such talent here in the U. S.?,1
The cult movie for every true Russian intellectual.,1
"It had a perfect balance of all five aspects. Cast - I give this component 10 points. The Action was fun and exiting. Once again, I will NEVER look and Robert De Niro the same again. I love that they used C. G. I. sparingly. The epic scenes were believable. OK here is how I do this. < br / > < br / > FX - I give this component 10 points. I grade movies on 10 components.",1
"What's more, when laughing at this movie, the feeling is not only one of hilarity but of understanding and agreement, which is always a plus. < br / > < br / > Sadly, this film appears to have been bypassed by Western licensing companies.",1
The movie is filmed very good. The music is good.,1
This movie is good for TV. Thats all i can think of.,1
The scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too. I just got this video used and I was watching it last night.,1
"I enjoy it more than Twister. There is an Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a town that starts with Blains - something. This movie has some things that are pretty amazing. First, it is supposed to be based on a true story. The problem was that by then you would be able to hear it.",1
"But this story is based on actual events. gitwisters. OK, so the FX are not high budget. This movie is in no way related too TWISTER!",1
"However, in the most serious tornadoes, people can be sucked out from these underpasses. < br / > < br / > The tornadoes in this movie hit in the fall, which is not a common time for them to happen. This happened during a May 1999 outbreak in Oklahoma. However, this is not all that unusual. < br / > < br / > I think that the movie should have been set in the spring. Also, people were shown hiding in a highway underpass. But it was still a compelling story. ( Then again, one of my close encounters took place in late September. )",1
I was even drawn to tears at one point!,1
"But it was not Lord of Rings. Rumour has it, Gaiman might be something of a writer. So, you know the expected audience, right? In truth, I hadn't either ( sort of ). What is it about? It's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy. ), so I doubt most of you have heard about it.",1
"And the music! ). Characters. Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. With that said, I present Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Taylor Momsen!",1
"I loved this film to bits, and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. He can be hilarious, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and ultimately he saves the Christmas. As timeless as they come.",1
In a word - excellent. Go and see it. The dog is cool. This is THE MOVIE.,1
It really brought this childhood movie to life. Well done Jim. I am with my friend deciding what to see. What we got was a roller coaster of fun. We buy tickets not knowing what to expect. < br / > < br / > The story is based upon the story of the grinch. Let me set the scene.,1
I expected more from Ron Howard.,1
They did it.,1
"< br / > < br / > I think just about everyone can relate to The Grinch's terrible experiences in school. Having read the original story, I must say I cannot agree. How The Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing. If only everyone could have such an attitude. The movie makes the very same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. Now, eight viewings later, it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time I saw it.",1
"The only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall, a doorway between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold. If I had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be The Princess Bride, a classic. I was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this film.",1
"I waited and waited for this film to come out, the trailers seemed to be on for years, it was worth it.",1
MERRY GRINCHMAS! You know kind of dark and spooky.,1
< br / > < br / > Liz jim carrey can do anything.,1
It's a visually spectacular movie to watch. < br / > < br / > Perfect Christmas entertainment. It's a campy movie making at its very best!,1
I felt as if Jim Carrey got a little annoying at times.,1
I've seen in three times and it got better each time. His rhymes are fun to hear.,1
And there is a new face in the movie. While The Grinch does not like christmas.,1
"In spite of what first impressions may give, it isn't cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually highly entertaining and funny. The flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out.",1

I was not disappointed. < br / > < br / > This movie was pure magic.,1

"< br / > < br / > The casting was also good. This keeps you interested. Michael J. His personality fits nicely. I was pleased with the original plot, even though the sub - plots were not. Not so with this one. I found myself enjoying this one. """,1
I LOVED this movie!,1
Robert DeNiro is hysterical.,1
"< br / > < br / > Thankfully they gave the music thing a rest. I was about pushed to the limits with Tarzan. To my surprise, I really enjoyed Disney's latest animation installment.",1
"As an anime fan that rated Nadia as the # 1 best anime I ever watched even now today. I do have my doubts As for Mylo and Jean wearing similar style glasses... As shown in the novel "" Lord of the Flies "", glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence.",1
Explore it!,1
"Atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer, and thankfully lived up to my expectations.",1
"My sons loved every minute of this film, and I have to admit that I laughed out loud many times throughout movie.",1
He's average at best. That's all. Everyone should check it out. It's great movie nevertheless.,1
"The viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach Atlantis. It is enough to keep the interest of the older audience. The writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past. The quality of those films is given way to the profitability. She takes him to her employer, a Mr. Whitmore. The crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers. Fox. A new era started with "" Atlantis "" following it were "" Mulan "", "" Lilo & Stitch "", and most recently "" Open Range "". Including that of young Milo Thatch, voiced by Michael J.",1
"Hope you all like this show! I tape it, too. It is so interesting.",1
I rate this movie 9 / 10. The voice cast is great.,1
"Atlantis "" is a new and right step for a Disney feature. The Deep Canvas sequences are pretty impressive. It's daring and exotic. Well, that's another case. "" Even in my country the reviewers weren't positive. Atlantis "" is a watchable, exiting and very enjoyable film.",1
They should've ended up with a better adventure than this.,1
I thought that this film was very enjoyable.,1
"It is written in stone that Disney animations simply ~ must ~ be musicals. Where? < br / > < br / > This is, in my opinion, THE BEST Disney Animated Feature Length Film. < br / > < br / > It rates a 9.",1
It was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth. 10 out of 10. It was a different level of work for the Disney people. This movie was great!,1
"Atlantis "" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember : This is STILL Disney. Both films feature a boat in some manner. Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer. If you want epic levels of detail in plot, turn to James Cameron's "" Titanic "". < br / > < br / > And let's talk about love, shall we? Such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years.",1
And others made me glad. But go ahead and watch this movie! It is a movie any age can enjoy. It is just like book.,1
"I don't think that's true. I don't know what Disney's comeback movie will be like, but I don't think they're out of the picture yet. How do you account for the "" South Park "" movie? What about "" Final Fantasy ""?",1
You must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this one. This film for some reason hasn't received its credit due.,1
). This show deserves chance to catch on and be seen.,1
"Not this one. Caught this film at the Arizona International Film Festival. Shot in B & W on a shoestring budget, this film is hilarious. Five minutes into it I was sold. If you get chance, see this movie.",1
"This is a unique film. < br / > < br / > He takes utmost ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real. Not to be missed. Just as the characters in the film do, we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the real person underneath. That seems to be the heart of the film.",1
"< br / > < br / > - Oh yeah, it's alsoEALLY entertaining. It has humor, it has intrigue, and it has pathos, and it all works together.",1
"He joins the navy, whereupon he tells his father he will be back.",1

You think you've had it tough? You should check out this film.,1
He creates a darkly funny portrait.,1
It's a nice break from the reality show blitz of late.,1
Highly recommended for teens and adults. This movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny.,1
Well done! The acting is superb.,1
Mostly by Robert Deniro. Men of Honor has many great aspects to it.,1
I thought this move was very good.,1
"He plays Carl Brashear, a man of towering courage and heroism. A wonderful film.",1
Cuba Gooding saved an otherwise badly done movie. Certainly not at the risk of his life. I don't believe the U. S. Navy was ever that overtly racist.,1
I was more than surprised by it. Robert Deniro deserves an oscar nod.,1
The score is also terrific. You bet.,1
"The acting performances are all excellent. Rapaport is marvelous, as well. A tale of will - power. This is well - edited, and features good cinematography. The plot is well - written, and develops nicely throughout.",1
i can tell hes going to be big! !,1
You can't find any flaws in the dialogues. Please watch this movie.,1
"It will be seen many times in future, I'm sure. This is one of the best military films ever made. The title indicates the source of their bond. And it is great because of its focus on values.",1
I'm certainly glad that a film was made about Carl Brashear's amazing life story. That's not good enough for Gooding who applies to become a Navy deep sea diver. < br / > < br / > The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding.,1
"The entire story is more amazing than the film, as the Director admitted in his comments. I doubt it. If you can do that, it _ really _ is _ good. However, none reached the status of U. S. Navy Master Diver. Too bad!",1
Like our nation'film critics. See this movie and get inspired.,1

I really admire your strength. < br / > < br / > Another curious question has to be this. My hat goes off to you Carl Brashear. The evil Lt. Cmdr. Maybe it's just me.

I love this movie. I use them all time.,1
This film is an excellent military movie.,1
"Most of the characters seem very real, and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot - ending with a good lesson in the end. ), but overall it seems like a decent show.",1
It's a great tale of courage and honor. Watch this one!,1
"Cuba Gooding Jr. is a skillful and fantastic actor and I'm prepared to get lots of more terrific movies from him. "" This is a great, fascinating movie and I can only recommend. Men of honor "" goes straight into the company of "" Jerry Maguire "", "" As good as it gets "" and "" Instinct "".",1
"In ` Jerry Maguire ', Rod Tidwell was a fascinating, but one - dimensional character with the depth of a rain puddle. This film is probably most like ` GI Jane'since it focuses on the desegregation angle. < br / > < br / > Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an outstanding performance as Brashear. This is probably the best I've seen him.",1
"The conmen have no heroines. Asrani shines in a brief role. < br / > < br / > Viju Shah's music is awesome. The heroine of Amitabh the cop is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is opposite Govinda the cop. Madhuri Dixit does a cameo as herself in the song "" Makhna "". She dances like wind. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, pales in comparison with him. Just Enjoy Yourself.",1
It is a imitation of Bad Boys obviously! < br / > < br / > The songs.... It was the all round Bollywood action / comedy movie. The action scenes in the film aren't revolutionary but still amazing scenes.,1
"One of the best "" Amitabh comeback "" movies I liked.",1
"1, Jodi no.",1
"As always, humour is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by a great deal of mugging.",1
< br / > < br / > < br / > < br / > This film did that.,1
There's even a cameo by Rex Linn.,1
In its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period Les Grandes Manouvres which is no bad thing. Several posters have quoted Renoir voicing his desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman smiling to camera. All in all it remains pleasant trifle showcasing a beautiful and charismatic actress.,1
"This, Renoir proudly suggests, is what the true French do best. Bergman's Polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self - absorbed, not in an unlikable way, but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions. < br / > < br / > Filmed in vibrant Technicolor,'Elena and her Men'looks terrific as well, a flurry of bright colours, characters and costumes. Throughout the early 1950s, following her scandalous marriage to Italian Roberto Rossellini, Bergman temporarily fell out of public favour.",1
< br / > < br / > This movie helps set record straight. This is a subtle movie. Modern sensibilities demand great drama.,1
"Yes, it's Rules of the Game redux.",1

"Of course the SOB is very good - looking, charming, etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman. < br / > < br / > It's a long film, but see it in one go, preferably in a cinema. Totally empty. Leaud is brilliant.",1
He does a remarkable job! !,1
"So why on earth would Daniel let himself be beaten and never fight back, not even to defend himself? You have just done your best, like all of us "". It left a bad taste as it was just too much. Oh, please. And : defending oneself is a human - beings strongest instinct. Was she going to be a saint or what? I disliked the ending, which was so loaded with symbolism and extremely forced.",1
My eyes became wet in these two scenes. My vote is nine.,1
"She has a most vivid face that leaves no one untouched. If you haven't already seen it, do it today!",1
0 on a scale of 10. I would highly recommend this film and rate it a 9.,1
"Give and you will receive. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was hooked. So start living NOW. I was drawn to this movie the moment I saw a preview of it on Oscar night. We are a social species by the way. < br / > < br / > I understand this movie was a huge draw in Sweden.",1
"My expectations were quite high for this film. It felt like real life. But it did not come easily, and not just by singing a song or two. It was beautiful, it was pure and it was touching but it did not magically solve all her problems.",1
"The town he visits, or rather revisits, is, unbeknownst to the townsfolk, place of his childhood. This film's structural similarity with the likes of The Full Monty, Brassed Off, Calendar Girls and On a Clear Day shows its indebtedness to the formula. The same year and with a similarly Swedish breeze, The Queen of Sheba's Pearls did it, and Babette's Feast also comes to mind. < br / > < br / > Its success as a crowd pleaser comes from two facts. Secondly, any film about small communities taking on the whole wide world will strike a human chord in our increasingly individual / self - focused and impersonalized world.",1

Five Days'is billed as something special, a crime drama that consists of a series of episodes, each set on one particular day of a police enquiry. In spite of these failings, the series grew on me : by the end, I was quite gripped.",1
"It is very well done and very interesting. This is a fantastic series first and foremost. That information is now different we now know because of fall of the USSR. As a huge WWII buff, I had learned a lot before seeing this series.",1

I'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation ( Of which it could be said I am one at 47! < br / > < br / > A series to own as a box set in history terms, on DVD for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan.

Alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants. Marie and Veronika struggles for Alex's affection and had a ménage à trois to boot. There is hope! I would have to say it was worth the effort.,1
"In addition, some of the footage is in color. Each episode is like a mini - film. Remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. The credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme. The series ends with the episode Remember ; the war's influence in a post - war world. < br / > ), and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war. There is one episode that's dedicated to the Holocaust.",1

It is required viewing.,1
I'll never forget it.,1
Then the movie starts. Look the contrast between them. Deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts ; no complexity inside of her mind. And the things they say are totally understandable. So Principal punishes her ; she needs to visit Deanna every day until five o'clock. I can identify with the characters and the situations they live ; I like reality. These things could happen to anyone. She's isolated.,1
Certainly any others I have seen pale in comparison.,1

What type were they? < br / > < br / > This documentary is SO far above the History Channel's documentaries I also own, that there is no comparison. And naturally, I always want to see more military analysis. A friend of mine grew up in Germany during this period, joined the Hitler Youth even, and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in WAW. How many troops? < br / > < br / > Perhaps he missed the first ONE and a quarter HOURS of volume 8?",1
The most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war. Utterly brilliant.,1
"It has lost none of its poignancy to me, indeed has become even more of a magnificent chronicle of some of the very darkest days of human times.",1
I grew up watching Scooby and have been a fan forever.,1
"The show is just genius! Sure it's different, it's supposed to be. when it boots up ), and background music is just gripping. The writing, the acting, the animation, all top notch. < br / > < br / > Sure it's ridiculous, it's supposed to be! You're supposed to get the running "" Roobi - Roo "" joke.",1
"A great movie, rather challenging than really entertaining. But to disappear, to hide like a criminal, is ignoble.",1
"I actually really like what I've seen of this cartoon so far. intelligence. Shaggy and Scooby are still funny, but no longer only comic relief.",1
"I think that it has been very well done and thought through. I would agree that "" Shaggy & Scooby - Doo : Get a Clue! "" Animation! Like many here I grew up with Scooby - Doo.",1
"To my surprise I found it enjoyable. However, this may cause fans of the original shows to hate it. My baby sitter was a fan so I saw many of the older episodes while growing up.",1
All in all an enjoyable night movie watching. There wasn't a lot of slow scenes. Well done!,1
It ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary. It was a simple story with believable acting.,1
i need a life. hello. that is all.,1
you can run everywhere talk on the phone do what ever and enjoy it in any way. !,1
true to form the British marched straight into withering American fire. andy jackson had a day to draw together a scratch force to defend the city behind bales of hay. Yet there are a few colorful comic relief. < br / > < br / > the battle was about to rage but not for long.,1
"Charlton Heston did a pretty good job as Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a bit stilted.",1
"< br / > < br / > I like the film though. Mmmm? She's brilliant. I get into the conversations too. Like Veronica says, two chicks at one time.",1
I'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad? The perfect touch of comedy.,1
Brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance. But who cares?,1
While not all the events in the film are historically accurate ( can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this? Don't be put off by various lacklustre reviews.,1
"Now General Andrew Jackson has been charged with defending nearby New Orleans with only 12, 000 men against 60, 000 British Imperial redcoats and 60 ships. The cast of this colorful and physically - lovely film are skilled indeed. Lafitte's men want him to side with the stronger force ; he wants freedom and pardons for his men before ceding such a strategic landing spot to the U. S. forces. it works in both cases, I must report.",1
"Also in cast are Charles Boyer, E. G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. 5 out of 10. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film.",1
The footage of J. extraterrestrials. Blues is the roots and the rest is the fruits. The narrative is from'blind Willie'Dixon. B. Lenoir.,1
It is really amazing. But this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing I might dislike in this Documentary. I didn't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome Blues songs.,1
"yet director Jean Eustache manages to keep it fresh, ironic and witty. 3 and 1 / 2 hours and worthing every minute.",1
"I last read a Nancy Drew book about 20 years ago, so much of my memory of the fictional character is probably faulty. Mom is but a distant memory, and the housemaid makes a cameo. Her Nancy Drew, while in the beginning does seem to rub you the wrong way, actually will grow on you. But what made Nancy Drew work, is the casting of Emma Roberts in the lead role.",1
"To me, the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich. I really liked this movie... it was cute. You will enjoy it!",1
"But it does follow parts of the games. There's been a lot of movies lately based on video games, and I think this in one of them. And some of these games actually won Parents'Choice Gold Awards. I think part of the reason this movie was made... and is aimed at us gamers who actually play all the Nancy Drew PC games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out. < br / > < br / > The games are based for children 10 yrs and older.",1
"Encore Nancy, just for fun.",1
"It'so rude! "" < br / > < br / > Nancy : "" I hate when people try to kill me. I would definitely recommend this movie!!",1
My mom even enjoyed it. This was a great movie! They all did a great job in my opinion. Go See it i bet you'll enjoy it!! My friend and I laughed a lot.,1
"In fact, it was one of the original formula stories. I liked push for more conservative dress. and never changes. There was almost no offensive language.",1
Final takeaway : Cute film.,1
or any fan of books.,1
"If my expectations weren't exceeded, they were certainly met. "" Tate Donovan is also great as the too - perfect girl's father, Carson Drew. It then begins lampooning the books immediately.",1
"La Maman et la putain "" is the beautifulest film of all time. Veronika takes the place of Gilberte, in Alexandre's life and in the movie.",1
"Well, at least Emma Roberts does a great job here. Anyway, as her dad had business in Hollywood, why not rent a home with a mystery behind doors?",1
"As such, it won't be to everyone's taste - - but for what it is, it is the best movie of its kind in decades.",1
"Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young audience members will not be upset. < br / > < br / > This is not a bad film.",1
"( Just like the picture of Betty Crocker, she keeps up with times! )",1
I really liked this movie! All of the actors and actresses really acted like they acted like in the book series.,1
I can't wait for sequel.,1
Its a really good movie! I Loved this movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > The mystery is just tense enough at times to be engaging. Had I been there without a child, I still would've enjoyed the movie. First off, it was clean, and I mean by my standards. It's all based on tension and mood and is a lot of fun. Nancy remains true to herself and her values throughout.",1
"It's so cool! Nancy Drew lovers, you must watch this!",1
"In my opinion, their mission was accomplished.",1
"Is it possible to have two lovers? The women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around, talking on and on, for something to sink in. At first we think it might be all about what will happen to Alexandre, but we're mistaken. Soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film, where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures.",1
"I'm not. When I watched To Kill a Mockingbird, "" the book was better. "" It's film, not paper. When the third one won an Oscar - "" The book was better. "" When Lord of the Rings came out, people complained.",1
"Love it, love it. But I was wrong. I loved this movie.",1
I am still amazed how she found it out. I definitely recommend watching it.,1
"Five Stars Andrew Fleming's film is indeed a modern marvel, a comeback to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in Hollywood. It is a movie that deserves to be seen, appreciated, and enjoyed, a film that is rare and delicate, and it's not afraid to be classified as fun! She is still good enough to get boys'attentions but she also knows how present poise and self respect.",1
Go see it. I loved clues. So what Nancy is in current time.,1
It was funny at times. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. This was when she was sixteen.,1
"She is not caught up in the trendy competitiveness around her. ( like, what is that CAR, Anyway? ) I really enjoyed this movie. That is due to script, not the acting. I got what I expected! I read many Nancy Drew books in my teen years, long, long ago.",1
"They were functional, but nothing stood out. We all enjoyed the movie. I'm a 53 year - old college professor.",1
"All - in - all my wife, daughter ( 10 ) and I each thought it was a good movie. I disagree with previous comment about this movie. I certainly recommend it. You can be smart and pretty and classy all at once.",1
"The Gang of Roses. "" Now, a small western town is under siege, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. < br / > < br / > A good, muck around version of western.",1
"Therefore, one can hardly speak about communication in this movie. The dialogs are basically monologues, mainly the longest ones spoken by Jean - Pierre Léaud.",1
"I don't believe this film was taking itself seriously for a moment. Only in this western, a woman's sister has been shot and she's out for vengeance on the gang who did it. < br / > < br / > So she goes and rounds up her old cronies from her bank robbing days.",1
! BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!,1
Quite simply the best reality show ever made. Anderson Cooper is hilarious 2. It's very interactive 5.,1
Jake Speed is a film that lacks one thing a charismatic lead. However the film does seem to struggle to find an ending and unfortunately the action sequences that are quite appealing to begin with go nowhere and ultimately become a bit bland and irksome. That's the plot it's not labyrinthine and it's not complicated but the story that it tells doesn't require great depth.,1
< br / > < br / > Recommended. I have to give this one recommendation.,1
"Not every movie has to be latest "" Citizen Kane "". I know the film snobs are snorting. And trust me, Wells was an original.",1
"This is one of my favorite movies from the 80's, it grows on you, and has it all. ). The actor Jake Speed is also a director, producer and writer of many films. The premise is that of a paperback book hero, like Doc. You will even be humming or whistling the main theme song for days after seeing this.",1
Cool flick.,1
"< br / > < br / > Why do I find it so inspiring? Jake Speed "" is a fine movie with a wonderful message. Jake is more than a Boy Scout. He's more than a knight in shining armor. At times it's a little slow.",1
"is anyone in love? really? I'm looking for a patron, anyone interested? is there anything wrong with any of this?",1
I can't wait to get the DVD.,1
This film is a great adventure. Jake Speed is a hero. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family has heard nothing.,1
"And the pacing does sag on occasion. And I just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel. Hero ; so I was pleased to find it on DVD, so I could watch these themes played out so well. < br / > < br / > Holds up under multiple viewings - m good show!",1
Her parents are entertaining enough.,1
It seemed very stagy and cheesy. ).,1
"< br / > < br / > Highly recommended. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as parents are delightful, and the whole play is generally a happy one. '",1
"Arms and the Man, proves that notion to be false. < br / > < Shaw manages to comment on class constructs, on the absurdity of war, and even on the nature of love. Arms and the Man is excellent comedic theater and is definitely one of Shaw's best works. She is shocked, one night by the arrival of an enemy soldier. You're only an amateur ; you think fighting is an amusement "". The play has flashing wit, buoyant humor and bitter sarcasms.",1
"Enjoy this for what it is. The plots are generally clever. The other players are letter perfect. Yes, "" Arms and the Man "" comes across as a filmed play.",1
"Whenever the world sinks into strife, ARMS AND THE MAN seems to soar as ever more timely and relevant. Consequently, we're immensely in the BBC's debt for As usual in a Shaw satire, nothing is as it first appears and societal conventions are stood on their head in the light of simple - and not so simple reason. While the best of Shaw has always been his ideas and his dialogue rather than his bare plots, in ARMS AND THE MAN, the plot sparkles as well and the master manages happy endings for all concerned.",1
That's it. Methinks the best screen version of Quo Vadis?,1
"Certainly, either one towers over that Hollywood camp - riot starring Peter Ustinov. Just as Bekim Fehmiu became the screen's best Ulysses, so Klaus Maria Brandauer may be screen's best Nero.",1
Wow! It was amazing! He got that right.,1
"There is a nice little story beneath the runway model approach in this film. See if you can find that one. < br / > < br / > My copy on DVD with another movie for $ 1 was very viewable. It has the great triangular shaped headlights. The hair styles, male and female are gorgeous. Victor replied, "" If money is right, I'll play Sampson's mother. """,1
"Brett performs as a resolutive, headstrong, impetuous sleuth. It's a must see for the Arthur Conan Doyle fans.",1
"At the end Holmes goes with Watson to burglarize Milverton's home. But it was a "" memoir "" of the great detective, written before his death.",1
Jeremy Brett IS Sherlock Holmes and in my opinion there can be no other.,1
My only complaint is that there wasn't enough Inspector Lestrade. I give it a * * * 1 / 2 out * * * * *. The story is interesting and dark.,1
"Here is an old science fiction standby, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept - and still they can only - almost - make it work. Just listen to them talk. The male actors are reasonably proficient at their professions. And of course, the series suffers for it. Too bad!",1
"I would suggest buying the DVD's, I am. I say bring it back, I know all of the actors would come back. The plot, characters, writing, special affects were outstanding!",1
"< br / > < br / > The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. The film is resonant with Eustache'personal experiences.",1
"Even characters that verged on predictability like the Keeper, the Official, and Eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic. Matt Greenberg and Sci - Fi should be commended, and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD edition of the show. The effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable. The show's low points are still entertaining, and I've never seen such taut pilot episodes.",1
!,1
"I have NOT seen this movie, but I must.",1
"I have watched this film twice now and think its quite good for the limited equipment used to create this film. See for yourself, a real adventure!",1
"The tweedy professor - types thought they had it all figured out. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. Wonderful. How can the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru and Chile look so much like what you'd find on the island several thousand miles away?",1
"< br / > < br / > His theory, like so much about ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100 % certainty, but the coverage of their journey provides for strong support that he is right.",1
"Actually, it is not so brutal. Is this post - modern man? I mean as far as graphical violence is concerned.",1
All actors are improvising and they are very realistic. We have the same here. < br / > < br / > It's real great movie and worst a rent even have it at home.,1
"I've seen this movie, when I was traveling in Brazil. And that's the only negative comment I have on this film.",1
"My vote is eight. The camera follows the characters, giving a great dynamics to the film. Cláudia has a young lover, Júlio ( Ismael de Araújo ), who delivers meats for his father's butcher shop.",1
One of the last classics of the French New Wave. This is undoubtedly film that stays with you. etc.,1
I highly recommend this film to anyone. The acting is superb.,1
"This film is a great example of how different a movie can be, and furthermore it's french.",1
"This film is absolutely stunning. Overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form. < br / > < br / > All in all a great film and highly recommended. - Renaissance is consistent and precise throughout. < br / > < br / > Oh, and the English dub is great too. It is a visual treat.",1
"< br / > < br / > The plot and layout is not overly original. < br / > < br / > It is the year 2054, in Paris. The movie proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious at the same time. Paris is an intricate array of levels and sub - levels. It is not hard to figure it all out. Paris has been intricately animated and laid out in brilliant black and white.",1
"< br / > < br / > The plot is secondary, but it isn't terrible. There is some action, and even a car chase. I am going to have to see this one again to get everything. It is noir - ish. The facial expressions are amazing! It is not quite dystopian. It immerses you into the world of a future Paris.",1
"Presented in stark black - and - white, the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based, and the futuristic city of Paris looms ominously above us. However, despite this Possibly holding the key to the woman's disappearance is Bislane ( Catherine McCormack ), Ilona's hardened elder sister, whose trustworthiness is in question, and Jonas Muller ( Ian Holm ), the dedicated medical doctor who adored Ilona as his own daughter. Renaissance ( 2006 )'was created over a period of six years, co - funded by France, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom at a cost of around 14 million. < br / > < br / > The year is 2054.",1
Worth a look. A tough police captain investigates. Paris is both ultramodern and crumbling into decay. 2054.,1
"The pacing and plot development are marvelous and the dialogs crisp. Although the voice overs by the cast ( Craig, McCormack, Pryce etc. )",1
"It is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so it's worth watching it on a good T. V, or plasma. I would almost give it 10 out of 10. The story line is great and well composed ; you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it. One the whole its well worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have it!",1
There's about 25 years worth of inspiration packed into it. Add a detective story and you've got an interesting film.,1
"The initial woman storms out, and she is kidnapped. It is in the harshness of its monochrome that Volckman's French thriller has followed no example.",1
"Have a Scary Christmas and a Happy New Fear. Okay I'll stop. 9 / 10 - 30 minutes of pure holiday terror. Bwahahahahha. But it sure is fun. Okay, so it's not that scary.",1
"< br / > < br / > Pixar are the animation masters. One scene in particular when Karas appears out of darkness is beautifully shot. It is almost a clever use of pathetic fallacy, and is finely directed also.",1
"Although the animation in Renaissance is certainly stunning and incredibly well - accomplished, I never felt like I was seeing something that hasn't been done before. Every second of the film is gorgeous. < br / > < br / > I have no problem recommending Renaissance to anybody who enjoys stylistic design < br / > < br / > Immortel, another French CGI film, also suffers from an imbalance of beauty over story & pace. On rare occasions the emotions in the voices don't quite match those on screen ; something that should really have been avoided.",1
< br / > < br / > Don't go watch it hoping to find a mind twister.,1
"< br / > < br / > So I think I'm just in love with the style this film shows, others are not so good.",1
"< br / > < br / > I disagree. First, it is well executed. This is to be applauded. Really nice work. Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. Old news.",1
"RENAISSANCE is not suspenseful ; nor does it look especially wellpaced ; but it's seducing and hypnotic. The atmosphere, the music, the characters, their lines, the plot are all nice and endearing.",1
"Visually this film is a treat for the eyes, and in that sense a work of art. Whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer. I would recommend it.",1
"It was awesome. < br / > < br / > That was one of my fears for this movie. There's no need for that however! English might be more interesting what with Craig and everything. Animation always seems to be fringe. If you're a normal person you will get scared by this. "".",1
"Picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper - stylized black and white visuals of Frank Miller's Sin City. Then picture a dystopian, science fiction thriller, such as Steven Spielberg's Minority Report or Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly. < br / > < br / > Genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair, especially in a contemporary context, with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted. < br / > < br / > An amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director Christian Volckman's bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut.",1
This one is the 1st. < br / > < br / > These people did an incredible job!,1
"Law ""!",1
"If the answer to this question is yes, then you should enjoy this excellent movie. Vive la France!",1
"It goes one step further than Sin City, and it does it well. It's style is definitively unique and very well made. It's a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures.",1
"The cast performance is good, in my opinion no one hits the wrong note. One of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. So, many people had true faith in them. < br / > < br / > Don't miss it. A BW comic book brought to life. Things you would not be able to do or see is accomplished beautifully. 3D grafics look 2D.",1
"First things first, this movie is achingly beautiful. < br / > < br / > Definite worth seeing. then you will be fine.",1
I highly recommend this film.,1
"It is also a watchable story, even if it isn't perfect. Sadly, Renaissance has had similarly revelatory trailer makers. < br / > < br / > I will definitely recommend Renaissance to friends. The setting is a futuristic Paris, and science fiction elements feature throughout.",1
"The locations are great, too ( I want to visit the nightclub ). < br / > < br / > That same cannot be said of Renaissance. And often very moving style at that : affecting, charming and cross - generational. There are flaws in its plot, but I'll get to that later.",1
"The visuals are staggering. A very half - assed love affair, if I may say so. It's a vision.",1
"< br / > < br / > It is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render. It is far closer to a good film noir. < br / > < br / > Nevertheless, I regret a few mistakes. I haven't been disappointed. You won't find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral, only the cold reality. The Those little things makes it a 7 / 10.",1
No one makes films like this. But this < br / > < br / > is not for the lazy or simple.,1
"Just like the first episode ; karma. < br / > < br / > Once again, the casting is just wonderful.",1
This is an important film. The director seems interested in taking apart some of the more tired cinematic conventions.,1
"Fans male full - frontal nudity, however... hmm, well... yes. This is weird wild stuff.",1
"The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. < br / > < br / > But consider this short again. These factory workers are Lumiere employees. And yet the camera stands stock still, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates it to its will. The truth. < br / > < br / > worse is the historical reality of the film. The first film ever made.",1
A movie to venerate! What a moment! How can't you rate this movie with 10 / 10? And above all the shot is a beautiful shot! And it's very moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that!,1
One hundred and eight years of the cinematograpy : what has become of the babe? It's as if you would condemn ( or praise ) the newly born for his future life. It's utterly pointless to rate this film.,1
"The film shows the many workers of the Lumière factory as they walk through the gates of the factory, leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work. Until the photograph started to move. It The idea wasn't entirely new ( Le Prince shot the first movie as early as 1888 ), but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary. < br / > < br / > "" La Sortie Des Usines Lumière "" would become the first in the long series of "" actuality films "" that Lumière would produce over the years. < br / > < br / > Of the 10 short movies that were shown during that historic day, "" La Sortie Des Usines Lumière "" ( literally "" Exiting the Lumière Factory "" ) was the very first to be screened.",1
You're using the IMDb. < br / > < br / > THIS is genius. Fifty seconds.,1
"And it is quite scary, but all in good, ghoulish fun.",1
"This one - minute film is arguably the first movie ever made. At the time, of course, their ` cinematograph'must have bewildered their peers, including their subjects. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the brothers'selection of a familiar working class ritual as their subject.",1
"One simple reason : it is only fifty seconds long. When they are all out the doors close again. But then the doors open and people are streaming out, heading home.",1
"It was located at Montplaisir in the suburbs of Lyon, France. < br / > < br / > During 1894, Louis Lumiere applied himself to the task of inventing a moving - picture camera. All films made before 1912 really need to be viewed with a sense of time and place. It was electrically operated ( using power from from heavy storage batteries. The Kinetescope machines showed staged presentations ( less than one - minute long ) that were filmed in this studio.",1
"Indeed, I think that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house. Overall, I was impressed with the movie, in that it followed book very well.",1
"After too many years of waiting, Anne Rivers Siddons'noted 1979 book "" The House Next Door "" has finally been filmed. < br / > < br / > Be sure to read great novel.",1
"But I liked it anyway. Yes, it is alive. The cinematography lends the film a polished look. The results are predictable. Without her, it would have failed. """,1
"Hiralal struggles to make ends meet and lands up on streets through failed business attempts and in huge debt, he loses his wife and children. I give it a 10 / 10 overall an Excellent movie and a must see.",1
So little is known about both of them and this movie describes them uniquely. < br / > < br / > Such movies are like leap years. They come after only so much time. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya do full justice to their respective roles.,1
"Little did Harilal knew about his aptitude and he gets emotionally carried away with small pleasures in life and fails in front of the huge idol of his father. This means he becomes mentally weak and gets psychologically deranged to an extent that he is forced into religious conversions and alcoholism, with debt and dis - obedience fuelling his negative thoughts. It had the best drafted speech with a subtle humour & a veiled threat to the British raj in India!",1
"For Gandhi, his mission was larger than his family's aspirations. The events in the film are mostly real. The father upsets his son's educational aspirations at several key junctures. < br / > < br / > The film does not debunk Gandhi and his ideals. A son marries his childhood sweetheart, upsetting his father.",1
"The acting by a small cast is pretty good. There's not much gore here, someone has a poker stuck in their head, someone's face is cut with an icicle, someone's arm is cut with an axe & there's some blood splatter but generally speaking it's not that graphic. This time there are Christmas themed opening & closing Crypt Keeper ( John Kassir ) segments complete with the usual puns. This particular version is good enough but doesn't do anything different or special & is a bit too linear & predictable to be considered a classic.",1
So i think it would be better if we stick to main idea and stop satisfy a critic in ourselves. !,1
Jaihind. < br / > < br / > Gandhi the true Human. Let me move to the movie review now.,1
I saw the movie and really could not stop my tears.,1
"Certainly not an overview film like Kingsley's Gandhi, or abstract as Kamal Hassan's Hey Ram. It has potential so huge to have been just a story differences between a father and son or just Gandhi or even both. < br / > < br / > This movie could have been great. 7. somewhere, the plot is lost and when you expect absolute epitome of emotions, nothing comes to you. It's borderline to that. Though, the movie's background score and the father - son and mother - son moments are just a brilliant treat.",1
"< br / > < br / > Overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. The movie took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is nice to see and it shows how human he was.",1
All the actors have showed the right emotions at the right intensity with right timing.,1
This movie is simply awesome.,1
"We never really understand why he turned to Islam, and then back again to Hinduism. Gandhi My Father is narrated to you like that boring history lesson that put you to sleep at school. The thing is, we never really understand Harilal at all. Show us incidents of their early conflict. Words are not enough, show us how these incidents shaped character of Harilal Gandhi.",1
"Mahatma didn't do that, he is true leader who leads by example.",1
"No dialogues, No screaming, but a speechless shot by Khanna.",1
"Well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream! As from old E. C. comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for! This episode being the first one I saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it's just so enjoyable with a nice twist. "" Only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve. """,1
"8 / 10 "" Gandhi as a husband and father? "" I would recommend it as "" must - watch - once "". < br / > < br / > Overall, good work by Anil Kapoor Productions. At several points, I found tone over - dramatized.",1
"He performed well and with quite an ease. From very long, we are seeing movies on Gandhi. Costume looks and match with context. First Akshay.",1
"Somewhere, the character looked incomplete. It nicely portrays the life of Gandhiji's Eldest Son Harilal. Gandhi My Father is a well made movie.",1
NOT ONE! Akshaye Khanna has proved himself to be a Top Actor. He expressed emotions very naturally. Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son would try to get close the Mahatma would come between them. There was a Sacred Silence... This is a beautifully done film.,1

LOL. i didn't like theses people either, it didn't really seem they liked Sabrina.",1
I was gutted when they decided to finish it! I'm now 24 and still love it now as much as i did when i first watched it.,1

"Yuppie lawyer Chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man's court. Yet, it's also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave.

"because a lot of good characters disappeared later on. but i still like to watch it, but the only reason i watch later seasons is because of sabrina. At the end, Sabrina would say some sort of pun that related to the outfit she is wearing, then disappear. i really liked the first 2 seasons.",1
"Too bad hes too old for me though. I'm sure the ending went to be perfect. I really hope that she picks Harvey! And I want to see the last episode of S. T. T. W! But there are a lot of questions unanswered. I used to love the magic of Sabrina and the teenage witch. I never got to see the last episodes, but I do want to know what happened to Miles, or Josh? And why did the aunts have to disappear out of the show for good?",1
"My kids recently started watching the reruns of this show - both the early episodes on the N, and the later ones on ABC Family - and they love it.",1
"Sabrina's friends rounded out the social experience at school, in which also housed the typical "" evil cheerleader "" and "" totalitarian principal. "" Melissa Joan Hart exuded a keen talent for physical comedy, particularly in her facial expressions. Each episode had a maniac, zany energy and rapid - fire pacing that overcame the occasional awkward joke.

As a child they always talk about how he does not want to be an exterminator like his Dad. Melissa Joan Hard is beautiful and was perfect for the Sabrina with her Perky personality. I supposed they wanted to leave it up to viewer to choose the ending though rather than spoon feeding it to us as most comedies do. I loved Roxy and Mortgan ; they were so talented! But I would have liked to have seen it. Unfortunately, the latest I could get is the first college season. When Sabrian moved into the house that season, they never really explain how it happened.

"This documentary was very thorough and exposing, and at the same time entertaining, which I thought was rather impressive. It was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these stories, and then be unable to see them. it would have been better ( although this of course was covered, I don't think it got as much time as it warranted ). I felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport, the ideology of the sport, etc.",1

We used to watch 16mm films at the local high schools in SoCal. What is missed is a bigger question of sociological importance : chucking mainstream American culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding. I was never happier.,1

"Along the way he gets involved with the estranged wife of the man he killed ( Gene Tierney ) and also has to try to get her father off the hook for the murder. Dana Andrews is one of those actors that I've probably seen in a dozen films, but who has never really registered for me.",1
"Playmates! Good cop but getting out of control easy. into his nostrils each time he talks to Dixon. ). Dixon knows it well : "" Who killed him ( Paine )? Why is it that he hates them so much? Notice how each time they meet, Dixon manhandles Scalise : he Dixon obviously hates what he sees there and gets rough right away.",1
"This is the way Noir was meant to be. This time he does NOT use excessive force but the assailant is killed. Dana Andrews stars as a hot - headed detective who all too often uses his fists instead of his brains. A bit later, while investigating a crime he's attacked by a suspect and Andrews is forced to fight to protect himself.",1
"'< Whereas the earlier picture had the strong intimacy of a country - house murder tale, this film is more conventional as a gritty urban police drama. Andrews, on other hand, has rarely been better, exhibiting a toughness and unhinged anger that I hadn't expected of him. ' The sidewalk represents respectability, integrity and morality only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter.",1
Dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river. Dixon cannot reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals. This information leads to Taylor being arrested and charged with murder.,1
"We don't just see and hear the city at night ; we feel it because Preminger lets us see and hear even the most peripheral and distant factors of it. As the plot develops, he is secretly entangled in situational snares, yet he is renewed by the outward acts that can be seen in the vintage noir protagonist's visceral facial expressions before he executes them. The troubled man reclaims himself with his own tangled impression of rectitude.

"DVD brings the movie to life again and I saw it differently. More frequently the subject comes up in an hysterical religious context ( in the various Revelations - oriented movies, the antichrist is inevitably an advocate of some kind of new - age style practice ).",1
The plot is convincingly worked out and exciting.,1
"< br / > < br / > Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it were Hamlet, and has never been better. As his girl, Gene Tierney is attractive but unremarkable.",1
"A detective ( Dana Andrews ) with a reputation for violence accidentally kills a suspect in a murder ( Craig Stevens ) and then tries to cover it up. He was doing fairly well digging himself into and out of a big hole, but she was just too much light at the end of the tunnel for a noir film.",1
Creepy Craig Stevens plays unlucky victim.,1
"After one case sees Dixon in search of suspects and answers, he gets far more involved than he wanted. Gene Tierney does a solid job in her role, as much as it is, being a sweet shoulder for Dixon. He's the perfect film noir anti - hero - he's not very nice all the time, but we still root for him.",1
"It's about a cop who finds himself slowly becoming a criminal. There's no intelligence in Otto's camera. My favourite genre. Ah, noir.",1
"With no better suspects, Jiggs is arrested and charged. "". Mark Dixon ( Andrews ) despises criminals, as his own father was a crook. < br / > < br / > It was great to find this film on DVD, after so many years of televised obscurity.",1
"Now he must cover up the murder. If you like film noir, this is a must - see. Little does she know, she's got another one on her hands. Pure Hollywood and, putting myself in Tierney's place, I doubt I would react the same way. Karl Malden is very tough as Dixon's boss.",1
The woman transitions from one to the other - - we assume they marry and have children as suggested earlier in the movie. You could easily see both movies side by side for a textbook compare and contrast session. < br / > < br / > This movie belongs to Andrews.,1

"But that's where most of the comparisons end. She has a quality that can make even the bleakest of moments seem brighter. He does his best to cover it up. Sgt. Where the Sidewalk Ends is set in a completely different strata. Overall, it's an amazingly well made film.",1
The advice is for him to cool off for his own good. And boy didn't they had have it coming?,1
"But they're wildly dissimilar films, set in different strata of New York ( not to mention at opposite poles of the noir universe ). Daylight enters only on very temporary sufferance, and director of photography Joseph LaShelle makes the most of the alleys and brownstones, the docks and the El. < br / > < br / > Of course, that's far from an end to it. Realizing that his job's already on line, Andrews dumps the body in the river after making it look like the suspect had taken a powder.",1

'he asks Andrews.,1
"But that's really not the point. Sometimes it failed, but often it succeeded admirably - and on a TV budget to boot.

Well worth watching.,1
"It's unusual that the male and female protagonists are divorced at the beginning of the film. There's a key, I feel, in his relationship with his ex - wife Britta ( Signe Hasso ). But I don't really think this story's primary concern is acting or the job / art of acting per se. Marriage implies a "" union of the soul "" in the traditional conception. He says that he never would have or could have become a good actor without her inspiration.",1
"Though the mid - section is a bit strained, the film makes up for any deficiencies with a remarkably - handled Expressionist denouement.",1

"her pleadings "" tony stop you're hurting me "" are chilling and suspenseful. Excellent film.",1
"He put into that character all his talent and sincerity. Shelly Winters looked so sweet, vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie. In A Double Life, Ronald Coleman surpassed himself as Anthony John, the tortured double personality. I would see this movie repeatedly and never feel bored.",1
"Ultimately, it leads him to the depths of insanity and murder. I just saw it again and loved it. However, this film isn't really about Shakespeare, and it doesn't matter at all if you dislike Shakespeare. Ronald Colman plays a famous Broadway actor who has begun to lose his mind and sense of identity. And, much more serious, he begins to see and hear his play even in regular everyday life.",1
< br / > < br / > Great raw moments in this one with noir realism throughout.,1
A brooding Colman isn't a favorite of mine. It became his best known part.,1
"Colman'Anthony John is a very good performance, and at one point truly scary. Let's take the second point first. But here he is not heroic. I can add Sidney Carton and Rudolf Rassendyll to this list. She demands that "" Tony "" leave, saying she won't see him. I have my doubts on either level - but it is among his best known roles.",1
"Joe. When you do it like Tony does it, it's much more. "".... Hamlet. Not to be overlooked is Milton Krasner's atomspheric cinematography. Tony tells her his name is Martin. Then he says : "" Or Paul.",1

"I am completely and utterly blown away, in particular by these two films.",1
"From then on she's sort of stunned by this even after she thinks it's out of her system. "" Watching John Cassavetes film, Opening Night, I was reminded of something that Quentin Tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting. Otherwise, "" as he said, "" what am I doing? """,1
It's a daringly abstract premise. I was absolutely blown away by John Cassavetes's Opening Night. That is perhaps what makes it so intense.,1
"< br / > < br / > There is the writer, Sarah ( Joan Blondell ), who can't understand why Myrtle doesn't understand the character she's written for her. And that's essentially what it is ; it's just that the audience in the theater doesn't get to see'backstage'the way we do. < br / > < br / > I always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with an actor.",1
I enjoyed this dalliance with raw wounded gall deep from within. The birth in finding real people is a happy pursuit. I spent 5 hours drenched in this film.,1
"The gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film. She's in a crisis. Kudos to the underrated and late director Cassavetes who died in late 80's. The movie has a slow pace and a dark, moody, frightening quality.",1
Would be great on a double bill with Mulholland Drive.,1
"The ending is a little ambiguous but I take it literally, it's the easiest way out and scariest. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended. OK, a man has died but it wasn't exactly a normal killing. This is one of my all - time favorite films, and while it may move too slowly for some, it's well worth seeing. Uh huh. The Aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans.",1
A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her. < br / > < br / > Almost - but not quite. The film is superb.,1
"The scene where she kill the imaginary ( or not ) spirit of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes I found in a Cassavets film. She starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. Both movies are simply amazing, they have a richness of ideas hard to grasp at first sight. But that doesn't help to much and Myrtle is one step away from complete madness.",1
"10 / 10. Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style.",1
"10 / 10. Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style.",1
"It's just perfect. Well, this movie is a bliss.",1
"But then, he always was intelligent, he just never flapped it around for easy praise. Who is this dead girl? Never before have inner demons been so exposed physically. It was once suggested by Pauline Kael, never a fan, that Cassavetes thought not like a director, but like an actor. < br / > < br / > It's about the mystery of becoming, performing, and acting. You can see some roots of this in "" A Star Is Born, "" and Almodovar borrowed from it for "" All About My Mother. """,1
"He also had FACES ( 1968 ). But the VHS tapes, by their nature, were mostly older films. 00. A few minutes later, this fan is hit by a car and killed. Yesterday, I went to the monthly Antique Flea Market that comes to town. What a bargain, as Eddie Murphy used to say. Throughout film, she sees the dead girl, an obvious symbol of her past I was totally enthralled by this film.",1
). < br / > < br / > Brilliant nerve wrecking thriller. So this movie might not be suitable for everybody. I love De Palma!,1
"Before I watched this movie ( today! Remember? Mission : Impossible also. Dressed To Kill is that kind of a movie. However, there are some low points... That's how it was with Kalifornia.",1
"It was on once in 1972,... I like Ghost stories.",1
keith gordon is gorgeous. he had the most compelling face.,1
It's a pretty good movie but isn't one of De Palma's best.,1
"Rated. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known for mixing blood - soaked death with macabre humor. Dressed to Kill "" may not be a complete original, but I'd say it's definitely worth your time.",1
"He does not. < br / > < br / > Anyway, back to the story. But some copies of DePalma's original cut still exist. What surprises me is what cuts he wanted. These are the ones to get, if you can find a copy. Hitchcock could only dream of what DePalma shows in his thrillers. A hooker ( Nancy Allen ) is the sole witness to the murder. But there are a few complications.",1
"Dressed to Kill "" is surely one of the best horror / thriller movies ever made. It's taut, stylish and extremely suspenseful mixture of sex and violence. "" Highly recommended.",1
"the film is very well paced. but i digress. to me, this music really elevated the movie. i guess you could call this scene soft core porn. there is very little violence and blood. but the movie doesn't hit you over head with it. it is reminiscent of how a 70's slasher film would look. i chose the unrated version. there is however one death sequence of note. but i think she does a good job with what she is given.",1
"May contain minor spoilers. And there's a split screen scene that I thought was almost classic. The scene with the sexually frustrated mother at the museum is gripping and well done, as is the later sequence leading to her untimely death. As a thriller it's tense and quite often believable.",1
"Its a bootleg. And the ending, oh my God!",1
Prostitute Liz Blake ( Nancy Allen ) discovers the gruesome scene & sees the killer but manages to escape. I'd imagine that every shot in Dressed to Kill had a great deal of thought put into it. The film tacks on a needless & unnecessary twist ending that I didn't really see point of.,1
"He refuses, and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled. She watches strangers, all involved in sexual or family activities, then begins to get turned on to a man sitting next to her. < br / > < br / > The sequence begins with Angie at an art museum. She then goes to her therapy session, where she complains about her dead marriage, before attempting to seduce her therapist, Michael Caine. The problem, for me, is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the director's skill.",1
Keith Gordon as her son Peter is brilliant. Dennis Franz does his typical detective role. The atmosphere is right there. The elevator scene is one of them.,1
It's a truly edge of your seat shocker. Pino Donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film. Michael Cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist. The finale and conclusion are especially'nightmarish '. Dressed to Kill is a must see for all cinema fans.,1
"). The Acting is amazing!. ( Caine Rules! This is a taut suspenseful masterpiece from Brian De Palmawith amazing performances all around!. Dennis Franz is good as the detective. Keith Gordon is very good as the kid, he had excellent chemistry with Nancy Allen, and was very likable!. This is a taut suspenseful masterpiece from Brian De Palma, with amazing performances all around!.",1
The prostitute is the sole witness of the crime. The audience is easily glued in front of the screen. He wields his camera just like a filmmaker expert is supposed to do.,1
"For example, De Palma literally lifts parts of Vertigo ( 1958 ) for Dressed to Kill's infamous museum scene. Quite a few scenes approach soft - core porn. < br / > < br / > Dressed to Kill is somewhat important historically. The similarities don't end there. It's odd then that director Brian De Palma was basically trying to crib Hitchcock. So from my perspective, I'm no fan of prudishness - - quite the opposite.",1
"I saw this recently, and I was so scared! I highly recommend story. David Birney played her husband.",1
"It is highly successful on a visceral level and I actually get involved / interested with these characters. < br / > < br / > 8 / 10 There's a bit of trivia for you. < br / > < br / > And to top it all off, it has a professional and believable cast. Writer / director De Palma's script is OK but it really takes a backseat to the man's film - making abilities.",1
The guy had a long run of better than average films.,1
"That scene alone, pretty much represents everything I want to see in a film. It is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of film medium. Not for the faint of heart! It is a dream - like movie, clever as hell, and with more zest and intelligence than a dozen films put together. If I was a film director, that would be the kind of thing I'd like to do. "" De Palma's movie makes a really good case that style, when handled properly, can sustain a feature length film.",1
).,1
Turned out to be Chevy Chase's first movie. Dealers skit is pretty cool too. I give it a 6. I didn't remember him in it.,1
"It doesn't always work, but pays off when it does. I give a 7.",1
"Sadly this movie is dated. It was at times funny, but it could have been better.",1
There is plenty to laugh at. I was born in 1982.,1
"I haven't seen it since, but would love to. Where do you get a copy? It was that funny. Each one!",1
You won't be disappointed. producer.,1
"For 73 minutes, the weird, strange humor never stops!",1
?,1
best movie ever!!!!!,1
I particularly enjoy cooking show segment.,1
I highly recommend this vid. One of the best things to come along in 1972 was Groove Tube. They decided on making it into a film for general distribution.,1
"of recognition on the'virgin's'face. "" but trust me, it's funny stuff. Just look at any video made in the 1980's. That act only added to the hilarity of the video. ) That was the'smoking'room, i. e., people got high in there.",1
"Good thing our parents were asleep the whole time! Lionel, that sounds like a train that I'm going to ride like a Choo - Choo! "" Ewww! ) or the face of the puppet talking about VD ( a scrotum with a small penis with eyes glued on ). Chevy Chase and Richard Belzer made their feature film debuts here.",1
"Really funny. < br / > < br / > Anyway, the whole thing's just a real hoot.",1
"And frankly, some skits are still dead funny. The Groove Tube.",1
"( That is Shapiro, not Nat King Cole singing Just You, Just Me ). Best of all is Ken Shapiro's manic dance down a busy Manhattan sidewalk. It can't!",1
And the actor is really hot. Bring it on.,1
"It does this while being relentlessly entertaining. LOU "" is such a film. We were both enthralled.",1
Bravo on next level of cinema. The realism of the movie and it's performance by Bret Carr is not to be missed.,1
Most vividly was the stirring of the emotion anger. What was this costing me? Soooo much love... sooo many blessings.,1
"I feel like its a quirky Gem for the self - help market. This is unlike any other movie, the closest thing I can compare it to is a Woody Allen film...",1
Very good performances.,1
"If something catches my eye I'll take the time to watch it. "" Needless to say I was enthralled throughout the whole movie.",1
The intention and the message is clear and profound. Bret Carr holds up a mirror unlike any filmmaker has.,1
Very creative film all around....,1
"He did most of his own stunts. Once upon a time there was a charming land called France.... People lived happily then. Men admired him and women dreamed about him. She, in turn, will soon discover her own love for Fanfan. """,1
The print I saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely so maybe a DVD version would enhance it.,1
as by story or the rhythm.,1
"Seducer : My dear, what made you think I was interested that bagatelle?",1
< br / > < br / > FANFAN proved to,1
I won't spoil the end. He sets off to join army and goes to war.,1
And what a gem Marcel Herrand is as the megalomanous and lust - driven King Louis XV! Do see it! That is not all : So many beautiful women in one film makes me wish I were in France and on set back in 1952!,1
A movie one will remember with great affection.,1
"really, really good. see it.",1
< br / > < br / > Remake in 2003 with Vincent Perez and Penelope Cruz.,1
"This is due to the country's having fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. < br / > < br / > The setting is clearly modeled on Paraguay. There are many references and inside jokes about show business. He sports a deliberately obvious blond dye job. The male population was nearly wiped out both times but the society that emerged was patriotic, racially homogeneous and strongly united.",1
Two thumbs up!,1
"But he became more confident and comfortable with the role as time passed. His co - star, Mr. Julia, played his role equally as perfect.",1
I enjoyed this film.,1
This movie is fun to watch. But all in all it is a great romp.,1
"Charo is on hand as a maid and manages to be funny and unobtrusive at the same time. The Winters character, supposedly a salesman, is actually a CIA operative. < br / > < br / > A very good film, not a big blockbuster, but very entertaining.",1
"Dreyfuss was perfect as the actor / impostor, full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have. < br / > < br / > Raul Julia was superb as the Paradorian Chief of Secret Police. You get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes. < br / > < br / > All in all, a memorable romp under Paradorian moon.",1
"< br / > < br / > he didn't know he could do it. he could hardly stand, had to use a cane. he was beat.",1
"No matter what they do in this movie, they pull it off. Definitely worth seeing. From there, Dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator, all the while balancing it with his own life.",1
Can Noah win over the people of Parador? and hold off the rebels?,1
"< br / > < br / > A ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator. This movie skewers the "" Actor's Craft "" mercilessly while dishing up a lot of good laughs.",1
I liked this movie.,1
Textbook example of an underestimated movie. In fifty years we will have the proof.,1
"The men instead square up in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that Lin eventually wins. The support cast isn't too bad either. But before he can leave town with the magnificent prize, Dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle and skips town fast. The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam pursuing the man who killed his father. This is a story of the Winchester Rifle Model 1873 "" The Gun That Won The West "" To cowman, outlaw, peace officer or soldier, the Winchester 73 was a treasured possession.",1
High recommended...,1
"Young Bull is killed during the attack and the gun passes to Steve. They arrive just in time to see Marshal Wyatt Earp ( Will Geer ) running saloon girl Lola ( Shelley Winters ) out of town. It turns out that Dutch Henry is also in town for the rifle shoot. "" He had got the weapon by cheating Dutch Henry at poker. As in most of them Stewart's hero has an violent edge that threatens to explode at any time. Winchester'73 "" marked the first of a series of westerns involving James Stewart and director Anthony Mann.",1
"Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later. I'll come clean. After reading what few reviews were out there about this short, I was actually excited about seeing it.",1
"The film has an extraordinary casting including brief apparition of Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis, both newcomers. Meanwhile the starring is going on the vengeance. Of course, all the essential elements western are in this film, thus, Red Indians attack, raid by outlaws, final showdown. The breathtaking cinematography by Greta Garbo's favourite photographer Willian Daniels.",1
The showdown between Stewart and McNally on the cliffs is great! They wouldn't stand a chance! I'd stack this Western against whole crop of Westerns made today.,1
Too bad it wasn't photographed in Technicolor. WILL GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad boyfriend.,1
Will it get back to the right owner? Stewart is the right man to play the lead. There are many classic moments in this movie. Dan Duryea is terrific at the part of Waco Johnnie Dean. Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly boyfriend Steve Miller.,1
"The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness. The weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably. This gives the film an element of surrealism which is usually absent from westerns, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols.",1
"Stewart does, of course, since he won it. This is because of the noir edge. But, not every one of the owners deserves to have it. One of the greatest westerns of all time!",1
"The film's conflation of fiction and history produces a breezy pace and an ambivalent tone brilliantly in step with Mann's pared - down, compositionally rigorous film - making. Nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue, relying on actors'eyes or a well - chosen image to convey the stakes. One scene in particular serves to explain his Mann's use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns. ( I would be remiss in not recognizing cinematographer William H. Daniels's contribution, particularly his superlative day - for - night, open - range photography. )",1
"Steve Miller ( not The Joker ) is interesting as a handsome would be hero who's interested in Lola but too yellow. This really is a standout and of course the first of the Mann - Stewart pairings. Saw this flick on ENCW last nite for the third or fourth time. Decaf no doubt. : - ) Enjoyed it so much I ordered the DVD. Worth the shot, I repeat. Tony Curtis from the Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson behaving like no Indian I've seen on screen have interesting cameos.",1
Casting was perfect.,1
But it's no criticism really. < br / > < br / > It was a pretty daring casting choice to pick James Stewart as the main lead. It gave the movie a bit of a sense of adventure and entertainment. < br / > < br / > It's also a really great looking movie.,1
One to add to the DVD collection.,1
"< br / > < br / > Anthony Mann was associated with B flicks in the film noir mode. "" Not that he wasn't already a multi - talented Hollywood star. The year is 1876. He had even done westerns before. Winchester'73 "" and "" The Man from Laramie "" were the best but the others were almost as effective. The whites want revenge. But to most movie goers he was the all - American boyscout type Mr. Smith or George Bailey.",1
But it's great story and worth watching. Enjoy!,1
8 / 10 Also as a trivia note a very early appearance from Rock Hudson as an Indian chief.,1
This is a good script with several stories going on at the same time. < br / > < br / >. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull.,1
Shelley Winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure. The picture has plenty of action and suspense as Stewart closes in on his quarry.,1
"In other words, it's a seminal work. The dialogue, the pacing and Mann's direction are excellent. < br / > < br / > "" Winchester'73 "" is a joy to watch. Remarkably, many of the most thoughtful and / or witty lines go to minor characters.",1
All of them are fun to watch. It has that same film - noir look.,1
"< br / > < br / > Dominic Monaghan, as Jack, is truly believable.",1
"Drake is aware of this lapse, and it helps lead to his destruction. Philosophically, Duryea explains he can wait. Eventually it does return to Stewart. Duryea gets the rifle literally over Drake's dead body ( Duryea forces the issue ). WINCHESTER'73, a superior film, and a great western, has a similar plot twist. Every character has a wide variety of experiences.",1
"The final battle between good and bad brothers, high atop a series of jutting rock canyons, is now legendary among western buffs. ( In one wonderful bit, two future stars - Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis - play an Indian chief and a U. S. cavalry soldier - during a well staged pitched - battle. In Winchester, he's the sidekick to Jimmy Stewart, a kind of Horatio to Stewart's Hamlet in this epic / tragic tale. In The Gunfighter, he's the town marshal expected to arrest Ringo but once rode with him in an outlaw gang.",1
"The story of the film, which always follows the man who stays with the rifle, is one of the best suited for a western. With Winchester, Mann created a different conception of western, but still maintaining all its traditions. It was to be made into a Fritz Lang film, which did not come through. He was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized, far from the average good guy. Shelley Winters, the leading lady was far from virtuous, she kept following the man who stayed with the rifle.",1
"The difference between the two is often delineated as mythically simple as the wearing of white or black hats. With some noble exceptions ( eg Wellman, Hawks ), the Western was healthily free of neuroses or real anxiety. Noir is often considered a psychological genre, visualising the traumas of its protagonist's head. < br / > < br / > WINCHESTER 73 is fraught with noir anxiety.",1
"And despite Sergio Leone, no one does them quite like Americans. Look at closeups of Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 pages of dialog.",1
24 has got to be the best spy / adventure series TV had ever aired. The style of filming and pacing is what hooks us to watch it.,1
! 24 is the best television show!!!!,1
Recommended in every way! And it's build in a way of having few different stories that are being connected together.,1
"Most recently, dramas like Lost, Heroes and Prison Break have earned that description. At midnight? And it truly paid off. Addictive "" is an adjective I've heard many times when talking of certain TV shows.",1
"This is New York City, the place where nobody sleeps. Wrong. An Insomniac's Nightmare is the story of a man's plunge into insanity.",1
"My vote is eight. Teri and Jack decide to have a serious conversation with Kim, and they discover that the girl has run away home. When an airplane explodes over the Mojave Desert, Jack has one additional issue to worry about.",1
And boy was I hooked!! ! Season 5 ended before I even saw my very first episode. I got into the series very late. The DVR is set and you can bet I'll be chomping at the bit! I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. I watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye. That's 72 forty minute episodes!!!,1
"Jenny turns Matt's life into hell, while he has a romance with Hannah. My vote is seven. < br / > < br / > "" My Super Ex - Girlfriend "" is delightfully silly and funny. Jenny immediately falls in love for him, they have sex and she discloses her true identity to him, telling that she is the powerful superhero G - Girl.",1
"Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman were great. It felt like it was RUSHED into theaters.",1
Never does the shock and dramatic serious crack the rule of comedy. Possibly a nine ( depends on how it appears on second viewing ).,1
This film is very highly recommended. ! She was just simply FABULOUS!! Luke Wilson was also good as average Joe but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. The special effects were excellent and the costumes Uma Thurman wore were hubba buba.,1
( 3 1 / 2 * out 5 * ) This movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children since some moments are little too... well lets say ADULT for younger viewers. I got to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet.,1
This makes G - Girl very mad and she starts to avenge herself on her former boyfriend. < br / > < br / > The story is quiet simple. My Super Ex - Girlfriend is an entertaining movie no more no less.,1
"Superman surprised me with actually having me feel good ( goosebumps! ) ( Maybe he was at a prescreening that showed more...? ) But for the rest of story I'd rather watch My Super Ex - girlfriend, at least it offers some surprises. I enjoyed it ; it was pleasant entertainment for a night and definitely didn't feel like a waste of money to get the ticket. You could see them wanting to make a joke, but no one in the audience laughed. Of those comments here before mine, I mostly agree with Edyarb's.",1
"Uma Thurman is just so grand, and i love her portrayals. well, this is an Ivan Reitman film.",1
It has an eery feel with it's dark interpretations of illusions. ! He really poured his whole being into this role. Is it a dream or reality? Dominic Monaghan really became the insomniac.,1
"And IMO, it succeeds at being a nice film. < br / > < br / > So. A guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus.",1
7 / 10 my collection. Uma Thurman performed as average in G - Girl's role.,1
< br / > < br / > 7 / 10 But this movie did have so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick out of. It was!,1
"It's one of the funniest sex scenes ever. But I can't blame it for that. Underrated, for sure.",1
"With all its quirks and inconsistent writing I still thought "" My Super Ex - Girlfriend "" was funny and enjoyed the movie. Jenny curiously asks Matt what was G - Girl like. First off, we all love the hero. Shocking. Luke Wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend. Because if there is a woman who can play a Superhero, she is Thurmanshe looks great. Reitman starts with a great premise, and really squanders it.",1
"< br / > < br / > I liked movie.. < br / > < br / > Thurman is also believable as the thoroughly daft, yet somehow still fetching, curator Jenny.",1
"The initial first fifteen minutes were worrying, as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of The O. I also found Magda Apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role. Overall I was rather impressed with the pilot. C but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that I very rarely see television tackle.",1
< br / > < br / > For fans of Battlestar Gallactica there are similarities and continuities with that series but it is also very different. In the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series. Caprica is set in the twelve colonies some 58 years prior to the events of Battlestar Galactica.,1
"Like BSG, I'll have to wait and see if Caprica grows on me, but it's way too early to tell. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.",1
"Which came first, the chicken or the road? In the 1960's communicators were fantasy. It's fraking entertaining! Time paradox? Of course.",1
"It comes very highly recommended. < br > < br / > With twists and turns around every corner, An Insomniac's Nightmare is provocative and engaging. The narration is almost hypnotizing, and from the opening lines, it is impossible to turn away.",1
"Paula Malcomson of "" Deadwood "" fame is terrific as his wife as well. This is an almost perfect pilot & I hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling.",1
That kind of makes me happy. < br / > < br / > This is probably the most promising show since Lost.,1
It significantly applies most to the 2007 series. The Caprica episode ( S01E01 ) is well done as a pilot. < br / > < br / > I give series 8 stars.,1
This show is very interesting and will have you wanting to watch more! BSG is one of my all time favourite TV series.,1
Special note it was good to see Polly Walker outside of Rome! I recently watched Caprica again and thought I might as well come and write up a review!,1
"If I had just seen the pilot of this show I would have rated it a 10. I was immediately hooked on this gorgeous new world. The production values are incredible and the acting is first - rate. We all know how it ends, but the journey is looking to be quite a ride.",1
"I haven't seen BSG, I tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but couldn't get into it.",1
< br / > < br / > Totally worth checking out!!,1
< br / > < br / > Looking forward to January 2010 < br / > < br / > What the frack did they expect?! !,1
Erictoltz is especially strong.,1
"all in all, 8 / 10.",1
The accessibility is marvelous! < br / > < br / > I was wrong! Stoltz's portrayal of Dr. Graystone provokes lot of thinking and questions. ( 58 years before the events of the BSG pilot ).,1
"Eric Stolz and Esai Morales give solid performances, and Alessandra was just wonderful. But it was time for it to end and the story to move on. I can't wait until next week.",1
Good show. There is moral decadence in a virtual world. Wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something. < br / > < br / > The basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads.,1
It has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent - can't wait for the series to start airing. Well done to Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent job.,1
"I was afraid that the formula that made Battlestar so successful would be reused in Caprica, which wouldn't work at all. I look forward to the full series. < br / > < br / > Caprica feels different. Battlestar's powerful rolling drums and mournful duduks served it's themes very well.",1
"< br / > < br / > I loved it. It was really very good. geek, because I'd totally watch this as a series.",1
He is without a doubt from the best of America. Those don't come along every day. The'meat'of the video is the comments made by Buzz Aldrin.,1
"Amazing to watch. Bet not. Putting the UFO "" thing "" aside.",1
"The actors are simply giving their best, the story is simple and attractive. < br / > < br / > I wish there were more of these in nowadays production. 88 minutes of pure bliss! Both were written and played by the couple Bacri Jaoui.",1
"I also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter, who is kind of a stereotype, but still fun to watch.",1
"It's interesting, confusing, and you just should have seen it. factor after the movie had ended.",1
Great fun. < br / > < br / > Rating : 3 stars out of 5. Bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie.,1
This is an excellent movie. She takes a trip to the doctors house and the interesting things begin to take place.,1
"Coffin ( nice name for a guy in a horror flick ) is especially bad in this case. Despite the poor acting by some, "" The Corpse Vanishes is an enjoyable movie for all to see.",1
"If you like old horror movies, this one is worth a watch. ), and the brides just keep on getting zapped. Good stuff. Hidden passageways, a vampire - like wife, an evil dwarf Igor assistant, and so on.",1
"The plot? They both like to sleep in coffins. Casting is key in these, and it's a pretty good one B movie wise, here.",1
so that his wife can keep looking beautiful. Heaven knows where the police were. She gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and Lugosi. Who knows? ) A fun little view.,1
"Personally, I wanted to throw away my cell phone after the movie. People, don't do it.",1
All the characters were OK and Wil Smith did another good day at the office. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant.,1
"Final thought seven pounds = seven Stars. The movie, however, was still pretty good.",1
"< br / > < br / > I would give it 8 / 10. There is absolutely no twist whatsoever, there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening. There were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke. This is probably the main reason why I wasn't looking forward to the movie, although here he is very understated.",1
The hole movie takes place inside his mind - or does it? If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan you will love it. It was pretty enjoyable and I'm glad to have it in my collection.,1
"Bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues. Up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have. Someday they'll thank you for it. This film not only doesn't follow the formula, it shows how other events often lead up to and / or affect what happens afterwards. The script was so real it was amazing. < br / > < br / > Go BUY this film and show it to your teenage kids before it's too late.",1
"It could only be about a man giving them, so must be about guilt somehow. Absolutely masterful. Will Smith's a feelgood actor, so serial killers were out.",1
I have never commented on a film before. I loved this movie. It does.,1
! I thank you Will Smith for another Great Film!,1
Who knew? The emotional impact of this movie defies words.,1
Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. Thanks again Will. I don't know how he does it. You cannot miss a thing. AMAZING and sad all at the same time.,1
now what is the lesson you can see that while watching. When its DVD was released i came to market and bought it. The way the director described the story was really awesome. Always he gives a record braking performance.,1
"Top class cinema! She looks beautiful & does her part extremely well. Will Smith, also is the producer again with some of the others. Once again, the duo of the director & the actor works as a charm. At least that's what he thinks. You won't forget this movie easily.",1
Maybe that was the point of the film. This guy knows how to entertain an audience!,1
What - a - movie!!!!!!!!!!! WOW!,1
"Music was great. Overall, excellent movie. Great directing. I thought this was a wonderful movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > This film has potential. The acting it is worth every penny, the script is unbelievable. This is one of them that can.",1
"It was well acted by all. < br / > < br / > It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I haven't seen him much lately, but that could just be me. I only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery. First, I did like this film. I would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot. Excellent.",1
"Although a tear jerker it is definitely a "" feel good "" movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > Lastly I can't forget to mention the crash scene re - enactment, which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music. It's quite a versatile performance. Put this on your list. Remember Gabriele Muccino's name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn't quite so high - profile.",1
This movie was skillfully and beautifully done. I just watched Seven Pounds. Wow... No one can make me cry like Will Smith. I don't know what to say.,1
"What is his motive? By the end of the movie I finally put it all together. ). I didn't. Intense, repeat intense, focus was on Ben and stays there. Nudity : No. Believe me, you will won't need too many clues to figure it out. The rest of the cast were very good as well.",1
Give it a chance. And that'exactly what this movie does.,1
"Until then, Smith, plays it mysterious, almost stalking people. You spend most of this two - hour film wondering "" what's the story regarding the lead character? "" He looks like he's lost weight and is sick. < br / > < br / > Will Smith, as a low - key "" Ben Thomas "" will keep you guessing. < br / > < br / > This is a two - hour film and not the typical action - packed macho Will Smith film.",1
"< br / > < br / > Our entry point is a bit jarring, leaving us off - kilter trying to comprehend what is going on. Or is it a car crash? It is his character, seen maybe three times, that really encompasses primal level of emotion being dealt with. With all that, though, I was with Seven Pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled.",1
"But nevertheless it's still a good movie. One thing I can give him a ton of credit for, the man can cry. Ezra remains calm and Tim decides he is worthy. She suggests Connie Tepos, who lives with an abusive boyfriend. After that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations.",1
Don't get my wrong its not a bad short film. You can tell that it has been an act of love for her. I know fans of Dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven.,1
"But when things eventually fit together, wow. Thank you for the picture Will! He has grown immensely as an actor. Very true to himself. The movie fits together nicely in the second half.",1
"It's a very layered and intelligent film. Seemed interesting at the time, but nothing too exciting.",1
! I hope it comes out on DVD soon!!!! the other actors were good also great.,1
< br / > < br / > Kudos for this achievement.,1
it was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique. I just saw this film in Santa Barbara. the actors were really good and i loved all the music!,1
"She's also very STRIDENT throughout, which gets tiresome. With the exception of a couple of major errors, the cast is wonderful.",1
What is better than rendering a writer's work faithfully and with colour and style?,1
Vanessa Williams is a perfect fit for Rose. < br / > < br / > This film is not without it's problems though.,1
"I didn't realise Rosie Alvarez is played by Vanessa Williams, she is excellent and very sultry.",1
"Sure it's long, but it's length is a testimony to how true to the original musical script the film is being. Otherwise the update is better in every possible way. In fact, his perforamnce literally steals the show. what did any of taht have to do with Bye, Bye Birdie, I wonder? Fosse protege Anne Reinking also does a splendid job with choreography giving the dances a nice small town, period feel. The sets and cast really make Sweet Apple, Ohio the place to be.",1
"I guarantee whoever made the DVD itself screwed up ), and the fact it was shot on mini - DV, then what are you left with? But luckily, from what I've seen, they are in the minority when it comes to this gem. That much is clear. Pretend for a moment that the budget doesn't matter. The production value is very low, but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school? This director really knows what she's doing. The story, the visual composition and the soul of the film, which are indisputably flawless.",1
( We loved his'Giant Step'number. ) Kim's role is completely one - dimensional. < br / > < br / > Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Or never cast her to begin with. Part of that has to do with the writing.,1
It was great. 5 stars.,1
"He is so great! Vanessa Williams, as I said before, is the coolest. ). Eh, maybe I'm delusional. < br / > < br / > Okay well anyways, I highly recommend this movie. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was that? The casting for this movie was right - on ( with one exception ).",1
The casting was good with some exceptions. They put in new songs and scenes. It was lengthy for one. Give her any lyrics and she could sing them. So what made this a TV ratings flop?,1
I think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs! The writers built a little reverse Oedipus twist into the plot - interesting choice.,1
Very funny. < br / > < br / > All in all I give this film a big thumbs up. The action scenes were well filmed & choreographed.,1
This is a brilliant political satire.,1
"Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. The sub - plots were somewhat predictable but the final interweaving of story lines made them all worthwhile. And as a result I was quite entertained. This is a hard to describe film ; comedy, satire, action, screwball.",1
"I love most of the actors. < br / > < br / > War, Inc. : 3. Hauser is disgusted by her. Her character is odd. She ain't great. The whole movie is strange. It makes sense.",1
"Serious kudo to her, can't wait to see more. What a script!",1
He portrayed angst very well. 3 ) John Cusack's acting was terrific.,1
< br / > < br / > Meanwhile Tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely union of Eastern European teen sensation Yonica Babyyeah ( a surprisingly decent Duff aping her own celebrity with tongue - through - cheek ) and the idiot son of the country's leader.,1
"). at its CORE feature is an anti - globalization gig, period. the message is unmistakeably delivered with comic vengeance.",1
"Brand Hauser ( John Cusack ) is an assassin for the CIA. Duff, especially, does a great turn as the heavily - accented, heavily made - up, potty - mouthed singer. But, once there, Brand runs into difficulties.",1
"( My gosh, "" George Costanza "" was right. Marisa Tomei is so attractive! ) < br / > < br / > The cast in this satire absolutely shines.",1
"The one person I was most impressed with in this film was Hilary Duff. I strongly recommend film. It is the best performance I have ever seen from Hilary, and I have seen most of her films.",1
"Tomei is funny but understated while the Cusack's own nearly every scene they are in. On other hand, if you like sly comedy and broad satire, this is for you. All the principals turn in solid performances. In War, Inc we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all war - related activities we are currently doing in Afghanistan and Iraq. To be fair, they are given good material.",1
Go see it!,1
"). Especially, Joan's hysterics are uproarious! I have always been a huge fan of Ms. Duff. All those critics, who shouted hoarse that Hilary cannot act, will be silent for a while. But after watching the movie the disappointment gave way to great respect for her as an actor. The film is really witty and you need to be equally clever to get all the satire. The kid's growing, but yes, so is her talent!",1
"Unfortunately, they went 0 for 3 with her. < br / > < br / > - Like I said above, the writing seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points, especially John Cusack's dialogue. ). Hillary Duff, however, was pretty terrible. He handled the small ( $ 10 million ) budget very well, stretching it to make it appear to be much more. Not much of it, mind, but some. The story also got a bit ludicrous at points, which is fine for a satire to a point, but it took it to a whole new level here.",1
"This film, as low budget as it may be, is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. < br / > < br / > All the elements of a great film are here.",1
It's really funny. I was blown away by the cleverness and originality in this film.,1
"I'd say it's worth a watch. < br / > < br / > Overall, film is what I would call "" entertaining "".",1
"Somewhere in the mix, a pop star named Yonica Babyyeah gets thrown in. He meets a reporter ( Marisa Tomei ) and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man + a hot reporter. < br / > < br / > In final act of the film, the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled. I thought it was executed very well, but other may disagree, and I could understand why. Seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely. With it's amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics, the film's running time blows by you.",1
"< br / > < br / > For all the rest of us, it was a light comedy with a political edge. < br / > < br / > That's all, and it works. It isn't. Ben Kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless CIA boss.",1
I thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding.,1
A sequel done right for a change. My rating 8 / 10.,1
"). He's sooo cute! ), and Lucifer's awesome ( as usual ).",1
I hope!,1
I rate this movie 8 out of 10. < br / > < br / > The magic has returned in me.,1
"Good job to this girl, I can't wait to see more! SO well written. She creeped the heck out of me, I can say that much. It's undoubtedly strongest part of the film. Nanavati did a great job putting this short together.",1
"However, how does your child react to it? Well, maybe it isn't - to you. Well, mine loved it more than the first. This film is great as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares.",1
The stories were not so bad either.,1
"It also stars Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. This is arranged by their father's accountant ( King ). She sings a delightful "" Il Bacio "" in a police station. What a mess. In fact, he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters. The young women are pretty and all do good work.",1
"They talk their way from Switzerland, where they live, to New York City, where their father lives. Years later Durbin was quoted as saying that she couldn't keep playing little Miss Fixit forever. Is there any doubt that Durbin will sing a song or two in her warm, luscious soprano? Is there any doubt the girls will succeed... with Kay and Joan finding love and matrimonial material along the way? < br / > < br / > Durbin carries movie with ease. Nope. She's billed last, but with the typographic equivalent of neon lights around her name.",1
She also has one of funniest lines in the film. Directed by Henry Koster the film had a European touch.,1
"But a case of mistaken identity makes the girls think the count is good - looking Ray Milland, who goes along with the scheme'cause he has a crush on sister Kay. < br / > < br / > This film is enjoyable, light fare.",1
A an ultra - light amusement for fans of 1930s film.,1
"< br / > < br / > As for Durbin's performance in THREE SMART GIRLS, I find it completely winning, and most impressive.",1
"Her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma, which she certainly had. It has been said that Deanna Durbin invented teenagery. This first film was one of the best. At least it was for this viewer who at the age of 15 was smitten for life with both Deanna and classical music. Deanna herself never did.",1
You'll love it. I can recommend it for everybody.,1
"The difference between Gilliam and artsy posers is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning. The film has immense re - watch value, since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing. His bald head is a mark of uniformity in the disease - ridden future world, yet makes him recognizable in 1996 world. This tendency for Gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art - house pretentiousness. The title itself is a mark of Gilliam's creativity, as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood. Definitely one of my favorites. 12 Monkeys "" is evidence of Gilliam's own vision and style, as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake. """,1
"'sort of way. Heinlein's'All You Zombies'was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time. < br / > < br / > Some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic.",1
Jose is sent back to meet James again by future scientists. ? but a big question also comes. So why everything is still happen? I do like the end.,1
He should just play good - looking successful young men.,1
"'sort of way. Heinlein's'All You Zombies'was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time. < br / > < br / > Some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic.",1
"< br / > < br / > So Bruce could save the world, but not his world. Bruce is good and Brad also. A very strong movie. < br / > < br / > Best. The bullet - well it might be some mistake, some falsification.",1
In my top ten. Lots of dark humour on display here.,1
"Being provocative and somehow so sensible, dealing with and between reason and madness, the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science - fiction films. It shouldn't be a surprise though, as he does an amazing job. It's so original and so entertaining.",1
"But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at that ( well, almost always. ). This is probably the most memorable performance of his career ( though admittedly that may not be saying too much ).",1
He played his role ( Geoffrey ) very convincingly. Brad Pitt delivers a perfect performance.,1
"The story of this film is truly remarkable. Apparently animals don't contract this disease. His acting is so great, he gets into the character so well. ( In a middle of a war. )",1
"B There should be more movies like. As far as the direction goes, it is prefect. About that.",1
A great addition to anyone's collection. < br / > < br / > The actors in this were awesome. < br / > < br / > A man ( Bruce ) is sent back in time to get information on a virus which has wiped out most of man kind.,1
I definitely liked it. My first impression? The complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters. The gorgeous Madeleine Stowe is quite a treat to watch. A virus killed 5 billion people. I have to check out his other movies. < br / > < br / > The movie is set in the future. This is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990's. < I can't decide whether this is one of my favourite movies.,1
"A must have for sci fi fans, or movie fan of any type really, because it includes suspense, drama, action, etc. During his stay he meets Jefferey Goins ( Brad Pitt ) who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race.",1
Whew! net / time / monkeys. html. For me it all comes to a head in the fleabag hotel room scene.,1
"It's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. The acting is amazing too. Light sabers, UFO's, aliens, time traveling... most of the time it's nothing for me.",1
"It marked me a lot : I remember still thinking about many days after - wards ; for my young mind this seemed quite mind - blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important. But because their time - travelling technology isn't perfect, he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things. < br / > < br / > I watched this movie once around 10 years ago. The scenes between Jeffrey and Cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie, Pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he Gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness, perfection and originality.",1
"He is gathering information. The film plays tricks on the viewer as well, placing Willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin.",1
An ok movie about downs syndrome.,1
"The world of this Terry Gilliam film is a world with little space for free - will. A linear travel within a non - linear structure. < br / > < br / > What we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions. Not to change what happened ( the past is inevitable ), but make the present better.",1
One of my big favourites. But good there is also a pause - button. Bruce Willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996.,1
"It is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles. It was entitled "" Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts "". Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing. < br / > < br / > Visually, the Twelve Monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a Gilliam film. < br / > < br / > I love Gilliam films ( Brazil, in particular ). But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness.",1
I know I did. You are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie. In 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital. < br / > < br / > The movie constantly plays with time.,1
"What we do know is that he is a man who dreams, and his dreams may have been reality : he may have already been at the scene of Event of 1996. Cole could be any person. Stories about the possibility of a post - apocalyptic future have been around for ages, since the very creation of science - fiction as a genre per se.",1
Even Paul Buckmaster's tango - style score is haunting. This one's a don't - miss!,1
"Unfortunately, limitations still exist in such arrangements. This film was the first one that Terry Gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for. Just awesome. "" It is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept.",1
"Now they are set on trying to prevent virus from ever happening. James gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Raily and another mental patient, Jeffrey Goines. But Brad Pitt, I'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did. He tells them the future, of course no one believes him, he goes back to the future. Who knows? < br / > < br / > 12 Monkeys was an incredible film. The story was just scary, but very good and a wake up call.",1
"It's got a real dramatic power. """,1
"All serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility. As Willis asserts "" It's already happened, "" while he's in a mental hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world ; instead it's Willis'inner struggle to simply survive himself.",1
I would really appreciate it alot! !,1
See movie!,1
"As a kid, I loved the movie.",1
"The sync is perfect in every shot. Laser discs were the most productive media. The UK had very limited access to anime. Personally i think its a big shame. Otherwise however, the cast seemed perfectly balanced. I regard it as a favoured film of all time. In fact. Dubs are often a subject i rarely agree with from so long ago.",1
I thought it made the film much more interesting. That's simply not true and a little unfair.,1
I was pretty surprised with this flick.,1
"It's also pretty sexy, with a lot of nudity and some fairly explicit sex scenes. While the plot may be somewhat cliché, it is also clever and entertaining. < br / > < br / > The film is well made, with good cinematography and fast pacing. I haven't seen many films from Chile, and it's always interesting to see film noir from other countries.",1
"Therefore it is Trejo, el padrino, who'adopts'Cantillana, and effectively'makes him'as a man in the city. Power relations become a vital theme, as society's outsiders merge in a mini - family. < br / > < br / > Film debutant Daniella Rios is the seductive erotic dancer Gracia, working in the nightclub owned by the face of the new mini - wave in Chilean film production, Alejandro Trejo.",1
< br / > < br / > Sound like a Chilean Pulp Fiction? Gracia just happens to be the squeeze of the club gang's leader Don Pascual ( Alejandro Trejo ) who is Silvio's boss!,1
"You like complex narrations? This is for you. 5 / 10 Throughout struggling, he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him. < br / > < br / > I strongly recommend it 9.",1
Not for all people. Hats off to the person that thought of doing this. I loved that. An ultra - cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. It's the kind of story that you have to make up the links in your mind afterwards.,1
"Patty Duke? And it's all worth it, in end. Antagonist? It really makes you think.",1
"Neither can his girl back home played by Eleanor Parker. He's stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self pity, and prejudices.",1
"It was during the bloody fighting Al was hit in the face by a Jap grenade that ended up blinding him. He's faced with a future where he'll never see again and having to depend on others to look after, or for, him! * * * SPOILERS * * * On of the first WWII movies coming out of Hollywood that shows how the war effected those GI's, or in this case US Marines, who fought in it.",1
The hunting scene is very good. She has such an innocence to her in this movie.,1
Good shots of the old row - homes as they appeared then. The Army Hospital has since become a college campus.,1
"It's a film one shouldn't miss. Definitely at the top five of best John Garfield movies has to be Pride of the Marines. Pearl Harbor is bombed and he's off to war as millions of others were. < br / > < br / > It's a great part for Garfield. His action prevented Marine positions from being overrun, but a grenade does in his eyesight. I do wonder though whatever happened to the real Al Schmid.",1
No matter how many. The battle scene was superb.,1
"Men yell with fear, scream at each other and at the enemy, and bleed and die, without the aid of color, stereophonic sound, squibs, or gore. It isn't just that we learn how complicated a mechanism a. A striking dream sequence is included. And they had one here. < br / > < br / > Albert Maltz may have over ( How could any 1945 war film be a masterpiece? )",1
This movie is a fantastic movie. If it ever is put out hopefully it won't be colorized.,1
"My father, Dr. Gordon Warner ( ret. < br / > < br / > I would love to be able to watch this film if anyone will have copy of it. And that is exactly what he is and I love and respect him very much.",1
"Check. "" < br / > < br / > * It seems like Bartel and Woronov always co - starred. A real treat. Bullied freshmen? It's basically a big excuse to have fun, and I'm sure that you will. A dorky music teacher ( Paul Bartel, also from "" Eating Raoul "" * )?",1
This is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true! I am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable.,1
"This film isn't about "" glorifying "" war ; I can't imagine anyone seeing that battle scene and WANTING to enlist in the service. What makes this movie so special, anyway? Not right away, anyway.",1
"The same guy, a Jew, played by Dane Clark, reminds him, "" In a war somebody gets it, and you're it. So much for heroism, but they get the job done. Well, simply : art. When I get back, some guys won't hire me, because my name is Diamond "". Everybody's got problems!",1
Mr. Tom played by John Thaw is an old man leaving in the village the evacuated children were send to. I have truly enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of these special movies.,1
The fact that the boy speaks Finnish complicates matters even further. Getting a boy instead she completely ignores him. Quite a heartwarming little film and not just for the kids.,1
"It isn't completely faithful to the book, but does it have to be? 10 / 10 Bethany Cox After Inspector Morse, this is Thaw's finest hour. Amazing! No, not at all. John Thaw is mesmerising as Tom Oakley.",1
The boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very odd ideas of raising a child. This movie resonated with me on two levels.,1
< br / > < br / > We soon see why this child wets his bed. He comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly. What makes this film so good is the touching of the human element.,1
A great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at time. < br / > < br / > However it is the relationship between Tom and young Willie that is the heart and soul of this story.,1
It is a magnificent film and I have already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends. This film has been on my wish list for ten years and I only recently found it on DVD when my partner's grandson was given it. Luckily I borrowed it from him and watched it on my own and I cried all through it.,1
"'I was sobbing my heart out ( anyone who's seen it will understand, I'm sure ). ). By time William proclaimed'I CAN RIDE MY BIKE, DAD! Really heartwarming, and definitely recommended.",1
Very good! Until Willaim's Mum ( Annabelle Apsion ) wants him back.,1
A man who was always so unassuming. A heartwarming film.,1
A truly heart wrenching film. Absolute masterpiece of a film!,1
John Thaw is a an excellent actor. A very moving story with satisfying ending.,1
A outstanding film. Full marks.,1
This film touches deepest points of the human soul and never lets go. I give it ten stars.,1
"It is almost ( but not quite ) worthy of comparison with finale to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE ( 1946 ). All in all, a modern classic.",1
< br / > < br / > If you keep a CD or video library then this feel - good made for TV movie is an absolute must inclusion.,1
"Young William ( Willie ) Beech is billeted with the protesting Tom. Tom discovers again his ability to love and care. < br / > < br / > Two points of interest. London children are evacuated in advance of the blitz. Willie is played to good effect by Nick Robinson. Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in "" Man Without a Face "".",1
this movie is awesome. sort of.,1
"< br / > < br / > It just doesn't get better that that does it? After a period in hospital, Tom realises he must kidnap him and take him home with him.",1
"It's your mind and thoughts we long for. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can talk, so can you! Roeper may well be an idiot savant, but in some other field.",1
"The film is reasonably easy to understand. The film's dramatization at some points is very well done. In my opinion, these storylines were weaved together very well. The second storyline is about Sam and Kate Barlow. You shouldn't miss it.",1
"Props to all those involved in making this movie, it was a real success! Holes "" is my all - time favorite movie! 10 out of 10 stars, I definitely recommend it for everyone to see! """,1
I especially like the work of the boys though. For example Caveman / Stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there. It brings out the child in everyone. Louis Sachar thats who.,1
( I liked it. ) The directing and editing was great.,1
You got to go and dig those holes. Disney has done it again.,1
The acting was also superb.,1
"I give this movie a 9. There, he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diamiter.",1
"Also, Khleo Thomas plays Zero. !",1
Why?,1
It was best that way. Siobhan Fallon was wonderful as the star's mother. What a GREAT movie!,1
"This movie should be on your top 5 "" to See "" list!!! Even my parents loved it and they're deffinately movie critics. ! My sister, who is 9, and I watched it and absolutely loved it! Holes was at the drive - in just out of town but, alas, We were just too busy.",1
' Holes'was a GREAT movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > The casting was very good. I would most certainly watch this again! It is tedious at times, especially in the beginning.",1
"Folks, let me tell you I wasn't disappointed. "" Now that I've seen the movie, I have to read the book. Most recommended!",1
But not with Holes. I wish Disney would make more pictures like it. Holes is an awesome movie.,1
"There is no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard, for example. All of his group are mentioned a lot in the book, but are not in the film.",1

Just loved it. Hmmmmmmmmm. Loved the movie.,1
This is one of my favorite films of all time.,1
"Aside from that, this review is about "" Holes "". Sometimes a goofy role brings out the best in a performer. ( 4 ) My second favorite performance goes to Jon Voight as Mr. Sir. He also can make Steven Seagal smash some heads. He "" dug "" himself into the role. ( 6 ) I love the choice of settings for the movie.",1
This movie is so wonderful!,1
"9 / 10. Jon Voight is especially great. The novel takes more time in developing the characters. But, to my surprise, I absolutely loved Holes. It works a lot better. It really is one of the most perfectly written novels I've ever read. I also don't like the multitude of pop songs. It is an intelligent story, and it's very well told.",1
How many movies can you say that about?,1
"Beautiful soundtrack. And I'm serious! The one - liners in this are smart, funny and unpatronising. Louis Sachar! A unique, original story with a good mix of fun and humour, but a mature edge. Brilliant actors. 3.",1
"The only down side? But then again, that's before Holes hit the scene.",1
Hello. It's not meant to be. ITS AWESOME! And my sisters.,1
"Jon Voight is especially nasty and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always. Perhaps the secret of this film's success is in its faithfulness to the original book, which is a little bit darker than your average kid stuff.",1
"Green Lake seems is, in many ways, a haunted place. With that the Judge enthusiastically sends him off to Camp Green Lake. He is unlucky in life. ` I've never been to camp before,'says Stanley. Holes is a story about Stanley Yelnats IV.",1

How can you say that Francis Ford Coppola is the "" so called "" San Francisco director? And tell me how they are not truly independent when they are funding a lot of their own movies. So what who gave him the job? And so what if Sophia wants to live in LA? They said exactly that in film. Of course you don't know it because you are so LA jaded. Don't be so sensitive! The only negative thing that was said that relates to LA, was about the studio executives. And who directed The Godfather? They recognize that SF is close to LA which is a benefit.",1

On the surface this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80's by a group of upper class neighborhood kids. Sure, these are just some cute kids having fun. But, this is also much more. These guys have. As we get older we tend to forget how overwhlelming the realities of life were when we were little. < br / > < br / > What makes this film all the more valid is to watch a young Darren Stein turn into a little general of a filmmaker. This adds a new angle to the film.",1

The remainder of the first season is excellent. I also didn't realize the series flopped.,1
It was really fun and i thought the actors was brilliant.,1
Maid Marian is also an appealing role model for young girls. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a John William's feel to it. It is entertaining. There is a moral to each story.,1
"After watching the first episode I could see why people were turned off at first. However, I still like the light and humorous attitude of show. The characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters. I absolutely love this show, but I saw the second episode first.",1

Something, Zorro, and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop. < br / > < br / > Zorro's Fighting Legion is a bit different from other Zorro films. But overall, this represents one of the best Republic serials of all time, and probably the best Zorro one. < br / > < br / > Another big difference is that the setting isn't California.",1
"Each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week. < br / > < br / > Zorro triumphs, as he always does. This was one of the best of the era.",1
"If I was loading up a time capsule of this period both these series would definitely go in. It gets 8 out of 10 because it still suffers from slow pace, padding and the other tricks. I also like the way he dispenses with Sebastian in the first episode.",1
Rock'n'Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! Dee Dee Ramone 1952 - 2002! The kind only The Ramones could do.,1

The performances particularly by Caine are amazing.,1
Everybody has his or her own agenda. Well written with good performances by all.,1
It's reminiscent of another fun Michael Caine mystery : Sleuth. Worth watching.,1

< br / > < br / > Recommend to all.,1
"< br / > < br / > Despite all of its clever twists and turns ; Deathtrap falls down on one primary element, and that's the characters. The casting of Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it. Director Sidney Lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus. It's lucky then that the story is good ; and it is just about good enough to save the film. This is not helped by the acting.",1

Minor complaints, both.",1
It's like a Ramones record coming to life. Gabba - gabba hey!,1
"TV reviewers poke fun at Caine, and he gets drunk. The cast is enjoyable and the story's twists are still engrossing. The couple believe Mr. Reeve's "" Deathtrap "" is the hit needed to revive Caine's career. And, the much ballyhooed love scene is shockingly tepid.",1
"You don't have to choose! Yes, the two stories have a lot in common. Even Dyan Cannon - who I normally don't care for - is perfectly cast in a role that exploits her annoyance value as an actress. I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of'Death Trap "" in a top 5 list of the best stage - to - movie adaptations ever.",1
"< br / > < br / > Sidney Lumet's comedy - thriller DEATHTRAP, as derived from Ira Levin's hit Broadway play, is a great example. It is less a murder mystery movie in the traditional vane than it is a movie about murder mysteries, derived from a play about playwriting.",1
"The dialog is quick, fresh, and witty. Michael Caine excels in roles like these. How about Dyan Cannon?",1
"Caine, Cannon, and Fred Jones are superb. The rest of the play's plot is a dead giveaway and to tell the truth Reeve doesn't mind a little gossip or even an inquiry into Cannon's apparently accidental death. FULL OF SPOILERS. He cannot permit Reeve's scandalous play - a - clef to be produced. - - he tries to murder him. Reeve allows that Easthampton, Long Island, can become Southampton, Long Island, in the script, for instance. would be a splendid set of digs anywhere. So - - what else?",1
Awesome movie! No one better spoil this piece of work!,1
"Stage adaptations often have a major fault. The script is incredibly convoluted, and keeps you guessing. "" 4 out of 10 Still, it's nice to look at for what it is. The dynamics of their relationship are surprising. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is quite brilliant.",1
"No surprises here - he does his usual good work. Together, they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed - hopping cast and crew of a play. He also gets to show off his very toned body, which he must've retained coming off Superman movies. Or so you think, for the first half of the movie. It's an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit.",1

"The rest is history. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have left us ( R. I. P. all ) at least we have this movie and tons of great music to remember them by. ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the Ramones. I have to check out some of their albums! """,1
"< br / > < br / > Summing up : Well worth seeing - - but not everyone is pleased with the ending. And that's precisely what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on a chilling play by Ira Levin ( "" Rosemary's Baby "" ). MICHAEL CAINE is an insanely jealous playwright whose latest play has failed miserably. Let's just say that what we know in the beginning is all you have to know about the film for the present.",1

And watching him work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. < br / > < br / > It's one of those best - kept - secrets that movie buffs always are always delighted to discover. It was one of the finest DVD purchases I could've picked up. < br / > < br / > I absolutely relished Michael Caine's performance. Needless to say, it's a must - see.",1
"And when Clifford visits to discuss the play, events suddenly begin to twist in most unexpected manner possible. Much of this is due to the cast, which is remarkably fine. It is called "" Deathtrap, "" and Sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit.",1
How does he do it?,1
The lovely Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence. But film floats because of the actors and the script. The possible weakness here is Thompson's laid - back direction.,1
I don't think so. What a great face that man has!,1
"And it's pretty funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat one - joke cartoon. Still worth a 7 / 10. And the action never leaves the interior of the house, which is usually the trait of below average T & J shorts.",1
"One of b - and c - movie producer Roger Corman's greatest cult classics was the Ramones vehicle ( originally designated for Cheap Trick ), Rock N'Roll High School.

"Tom can't take anymore so he tries to sleep this nightmare off, but Jerry sets fire to his paw! I always found Jerry, the little mouse, more evil than cute.",1

"< br / > < br / > In the Shepard print, the film ends with Mary stating, "" You see, I've changed my mind - - I'm never going home. "" Several aspects of this one stand out, though. This additional footage develops the character Vivian, who had little relevance in the Shepard version. < br / > < br / > Self - referential films, which made film - making focus of the films, were nothing new by now.

"The doors and walls are just flats that are hastily assembled for the set. She is immediately attracted to the dashing film star Kenneth Driscoll ( Robert Warwick ).

"The only thing odd is the casting. Even if you know nothing about bridge, you may still want to check out a rare example Hollywood satire.",1
Roscoe Karns handles the fast - talking dialogue as a brash radio announcer. Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is wonderful as a snobbish bridge expert.,1

About a year ago I checked it out on IMDb and discovered no copies available. The film illustrates this exceptionally well.,1
I saw this film prior to joining the British Army. She spent some time out there researching. The answer is right at the end. Some years later I was in Canada for a family get together.,1
This is more of a thinking man's movie. Enjoy! It is brutal in other ways though as you see killing at a personal level. All are unusual in their way and show war at a personal level. Once you start to watch you don't want to miss anything. This maybe called a war triller.,1
Fantastic!,1

Curly Sue is just that.,1

The rocks are actually convincing for such a low - budget flick. This is definitely an uder - rated gem. ! Definitely a classic!,1
Only PG rated. Of course I love the Ramones. That's rare for a movie in this category. One of the best if not the best rock'n'roll movies ever. And it's not just mindless fun.,1
No dreaming now. of watching this as a child. I've asked numerous people if they've seen this flick but to no avail. Anything that can stay embedded in my mind's eye for 23 years deserves a'10 '.,1

A great story about a young girl who's had enough and other worldly forces trying to help make things right. That's not the case with this one.,1
He's gotten really good especially since then! I thought the main actor demon guy was really good. The other was a very simple story. The dad did well also. This movie got the most applause of all the films that evening. But to my surprise I really enjoyed this.,1
This is not a sci - fi nor action film of any sort. I mean really win me over. He was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon. What do I say about such an absolutely beautiful film?,1
But this stuck in my head days after watching it. The acting was absolutely superb by him. It is rare you get to see such a high quality short. I never knew he could act so well! I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this. The girl's was okay and the father's was decent. The effects and cinematography were absolutely mind blowing.,1
This leans towards the Gothic feel.,1

Jeff Combs has more talent than he is recognized for. I truly enjoyed this film. The only part of this flick I would change was the ending.,1

I have only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Halloween is crowning achievement of the horror genre. Boy was I wrong.,1
"< br / > < br / > The story is simple. Not a chance. It takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe. < br / > < br / > "" Halloween "" is such a film. Most modern horror movies fit into this category. But nearly all of them work. "" He relies on ideas for scares, and",1
"It is terrifying and well acted. A force that cannot be denied. He walks slowly. Simplicity. < br / > < br / > As horror, this is essential. It is also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a human.",1
"This also peaks our audience. Then, Michael disappears. What will he do? We gasp. This movie has little blood, but still provides good scares.",1
"The difference between them, and this, is, quite simply, that "" Halloween "" is the best. It was "" The Night HE Came Home, "" warned the posters for John Carpenter's career - making horror classic.",1
"Myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion. With a simplistic story and an engaging heroine, this was the horror movie that started it all.",1
"He is as unstoppable force. Now that is terror for a 10 year old. This all could happen. In bastion of American safety and security, chaos can still strike. So we ourselves are contributing to our own fears and anxiety.",1
Oh and if your thinking about watching the Rob Zombie remake don't. So by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it.,1
This film is SO great. I am getting furious just thinking about it!!!!!!,1
It took me time to really appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. This movie is meant to be scary and I think it succeeds very well. It's about the worst night in Laurie Strode's short life. I watched it a couple of times recently and I know now I was wrong. Need I say more? It's not about blood and gore. Very highly recommended!,1
I admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for few nights. It is one of the eeriest images in movie history. It is just pure terror.,1
"Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. Predictable horror movies bore me. : )",1
"Highest kudos also go to Carpenter's simple, yet frighteningly unnerving music score. It is a MUST for all genre fans! The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect performance as a Myer's doctor, who's desperate to capture him again. In a sense, Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film!",1
"She gives a tremendous performance. Horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. Halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. Death at any turn. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time. Without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient.",1
"And for an even more frightful time, try watching it alone with the lights off. It's reputation truly proceeded it. It works on many levels and draws audience in and never lets up. < br / > < br / > Halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie.",1
"John Carpenter's Halloween < br / > < br / > Is it the greatest horror film of all time? The film is sheer genius and will always hold a very special place in my heart. no.. maybe not to everyone, but to me it is and always will be.",1
"< br / > < br / > This film may seem cliché today, but back then there wasn't much out there like this. This is just the start of things to come from Michael Myers. He manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs. Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. This evil will not be contained, and it cannot be stopped. But this one started it all, sort of.",1
"If you like monty python, You will love this film. This movie is SOOOO funny!!! I think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance. I absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism.",1
"This is his ultimate film. That was scary, yet utterly brilliant. I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. < br / > < br / > John Carpenter is the master of horror.",1
It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. It is a simple movie told very well. I wish they had never made sequel after sequel. The cast is all terrific.,1
""". He was just so terrifying! Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! Halloween, the ultimate horror film!",1
"This is my favorite John Carpenter movie of all time. < br / > < br / > It's fantastic, and worth seeking out. Not very many. It's subtle compared to the nasty bloodbaths many of those subsequent movies were ; subtle, and scary.",1
"< br / > < br / > The acting is roundelay good. No bells or whistles, just the basics. The fear is not in death, but in not knowing. My personal favorite horror film. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence.",1
A true classic. John Carpenter's Halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece. Get that!,1
"The scariest night of the year! Besides the setting, there is some great acting. I also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture. Along with the setting, the movie takes place on Halloween!!",1
He showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. What was that shadow? No movie. I even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today. But they don't. < br / > < br I feel that they ( and others like them ) don't know what true horror is.,1
i liked this movie a lot.,1
I really enjoyed this movie.,1
"And no, the film doesn't feel dated one bit, and yes, it was worth the wait. ) The film ends with an explosive confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kid's wet dream. Fun stuff indeed. This is a very high - energy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments. Well, I have finally caught up with "" Rock'N'Roll High School, "" almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979.",1
"This is a far cry from the crappy live action Conan, not to speak of all the B - movie of the genre. Surprisingly, the animation manages to keep the feeling of the original art. < br / > < br / > Definite recommended!",1
< br / > < br / > I highly recommend this movie to fantasy and animation lovers everywhere especially the new 2 - Disc Limited Edition DVD from Blue Underground.,1
Thsi is one great movie. a must watch movie.,1
There's a slight drawback for Bakshi fans in this facet of character design ; Bakshi went as far as to say it's more Frazetta than him. < br / > < br / > I neglect describing plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it. Watching Fire and Ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year.,1
With Ralph Bakshi most of his films appear to be like two - edged swords. The rotoscoping is a lot more detailed and the animation has a vibrant look to it. It's still hella cool and really funny. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story which perhaps didn't always shine in the animation department.,1
"This is another fantasy favorite from Ralph Bakshi ; after watching it on YouTube that is. And also the painter Thomas Kinkade, noted for his artwork for figurines, music - boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company besides paintings. With plenty of fantasy, sexual innuendo, and thrilling adventure. And like Bakshi's films The Lord of the Rings and American Pop, this movie was rotoscoped, but the process works better in this film than in the former. Set in the distant past after the Ice Age, it is a prehistoric sword - and - sorcery quest between good and evil.",1
The casting was well done and scenes and music are first rate. Good story and excellent animation.,1
It had some very nice animation in parts and the story was entertaining enough. Fire And Ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world.,1
"How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? < br / > < br / > Take none of it seriously. It's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers. Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea. Just go in and have a good time.",1
But I had also enjoyed this animation as a child and I never forgot it. It's quite effective. < br / > < br / > I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10. What sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated. I for sure did not mind!,1
I don't mind that because it is believable and there is no sex scene. The art is good and you see glimpses of Frazetta at his best. Enjoy! Therefore the 2005 release was a dream come true for me.,1
"I was amazed at how realistic the movements of the characters were. Anyone looking for "" depth "" would be sorely disappointed. < br / > < br / > Did i say bad guys?? I won't claim to be a fan of Ralph Bakshi, because i am not. yes i did.",1
I hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves. This is not similar to Bakshi's usual frenetic style.,1
"Animation are extremely smooth and realistic. For the duration of the movie you believe in the world you see, so everyone did a great job. Finally, the setting is not so popular at the moment.",1
The colors are not that... colorous. Tho whole impression of the movie is more sinister and dark...,1
< br / > < br / > As for the action scenes : superb. Really. < br / > < br / > The animation is quite good.,1
insist.,1
7 / 10. Thats my favorite scene of the film. It's a cat mouse film. Its brilliant. I think RB is 6th in my list by David Dhawan. 'Raja Babu'is one of my most favorite characters.,1
"And she vows to make the students'toe - the - line '. Certainly, this is a good film for Ramones fans. But Riff has clever ways to foil Togar, at every turn. Mary is a legendary B movie actress.",1

The plot was seamless. < br / > < br / > I was so impressed by the other actors. ! This movie changed my life!,1

"< br / > < br / > but i ask you, why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap? < br / > < br / > only qualm i have with this film, is that there was never a sequel made. where would one start a review of the film Snitch'd? James Cahill, god rest his soul, made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since Encino Man. his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop McClure, which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor! YUCK!",1

It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. WOW! I never expected that. Then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away. this is a good movie!,1
This was genius. This was a film that anyone can enjoy. Instead we watched film right through. Ever.,1
"They certainly don't make them like this anymore. What a fun filled, sexy movie! ), I'll eat my hat.",1
"You observe, think, and question. This is Not a Love Song. < br / > < br / > However this film stands unique against both.",1
What follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of Schotland. The farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them. The two friends literally have to run for their lives. Than it all goes wrong. Especially because this isn't actually a bad movie. I give it a 7 / 10.,1
I had already guessed that there were so gay intentions on the part of Heaton.,1
It is a small film that is complex to watch and that is what makes it appealing.,1
"< br / > < br / > However you need to dig deeper to uncover the true feeling of the true genre. As it is suggested, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, filled with trust, deceit and betrayal. I am currently doing film studies at A.",1
"Don't expect more, you won't find it. Another Allan Arkush classic movie in a similar vein is Get Crazy, featuring Lee Ving from legendary hardcore punk band Fear. It's great fun, so enjoy it. This movie, like most classics, is stupid fun with some classic Ramones footage in their heyday.",1
He needs him. They need each other.,1
Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike. < br / > < br / > I really enjoyed this film. Although it is not for the faint hearted.,1
"What they wind up in is just that, with one accidentally shooting a girl and the two escaping by foot into the countryside. But, Heaton was there to keep things in check up until things get way over his head as well. Any input on this is appreciated!",1
The ending is superb.,1

"Agrarian China is giving way to industrial China. This is the future symbolically speaking, and the old bathhouse we will see in the next scene is the past. Yet I wonder how the Chinese government views this film. No way. Industrialization blues? He is uncomfortable with what he sees as the unsophisticated behavior of his father and brother.",1
I like this film a lot.,1

He founds that his father is still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business, the public bathroom. < br / > < br / > An awesome, and touching film.

She remarked to the effect that the band shouldn't talk to him like that. And I am not gay. What she is is a pro. I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. Kris came right back to the effect that they were his friends and they WERE rock and roll! I think it is a fine romance. Stephen was and is Kris's friend and long time band member. I was never a fan of Kris's singing until his last effort for New West.,1

I thought they worked very well together. It was my all time favorite movie of 1976.,1
"This version of the story is also more believable in it's portrayal of the lead characters. The film open to scathingly negative reviews, however, $ 5.

The music is great as well.,1
"Inevitably, he can't handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success, and if you are familiar with any version of this story, you know the rest. In the movie's most pivotal scene, he gives Esther her big break at a benefit concert, and her career takes off.",1

"It is as if human character lacked any nuance. The bad are really, really, bad, and good are super heroes. After each had read the poem, we watched the film together.

"The bad thing is that one of them is hidden Katya's boobs. There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them pretty long and tricky. It was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting storyline. < br / > < br / > The great thing about this game is that it actually has actors voicing the characters, such as Cleese voicing Q. I have to say, he was right.",1
"Which even had its own theme song! Such a great cast and well - written storyline. If you haven't played it yet, you're missing out! Which gives it that more cinematic feel.

"Anyway, the movie was stellar, and I look forward to owning it as soon as the DVD is released. In my mind, that is not a bad thing. This is almost definitely due to Crowe's longstanding ties to music, as anyone who has seen Almost Famous knows, and to his marriage to Heart star Nancy Wilson. Well, having just seen it, let me say that the former was correct, and the latter couldn't have been more wrong. It is a very weird movie, and nothing really comes together until the end. I was moved by the film, and felt emotionally spent by the end.",1
"And if that's not enough reason to see it, go see it for the music. Confusing is The Matrix or The Game. And unlike Kubrick, this movie has a conclusion. Different is The Truman Show. THAT'S the point. Weird is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore.",1

"The one was "" Stir of Echoes "" with Kevin Bacon, and the second was "" Vanilla Sky "".

The actors are awesome, the sound track is excellent, and everything in the movie is 9 +.",1
It actually made me think.,1
< br / > < br / > Watch for a young Laura Dern. If you are a late 70's fan you'll love the film. This film drives that point home to the core.,1
"It's not that kind of film. I went to see Vanilla Sky with a huge, huge, huge!!.. The strange thing is I cannot say why, all I can say is that I found it totally involving and could not stop thinking about it the next day. !",1

In the movie, however, it is not the acting that really impresses - its the filmmaking. < br / > < br / > You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. I haven't seen the original movie, but if its better than this, I'd be in heaven. However, it was a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack ( a distinguishing feature of a Crowe movie ) is also sublime.",1

"The theme will really get you to "" open your eyes "". This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion. I think the end is perfect though. The sweet is never as sweet without the sour. "" I recommend you watch it and see for yourself.",1
I think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up. My best friend was a Deidre and her good friend from childhood was our Annie. I remember thinking how real it was and how I wished that they would make movies like that still.,1
This film is one of Tom Cruise's finest films. If you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try. His character can relate to us all in some way.,1
"If you look hard, you may be able to find a copy yourself ). It has honestly touched my life, as true art has a tendency of doing. < br / > < br / > The music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly. Without the music, the story is only half told.",1
"The cast, superb. By the end of the movie, I was awstruck. It was an all around wonderful movie. I wasn't disappointed.",1
"And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made. The film is very complex, but not confusing.",1
And fueling the fires of discontent is their perception that David lacks focus the job requires. What is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream?,1

"Though not of the caliber of Civil War films such as "" Glory "" or "" Gettysburg, "" provides a lot of history on the pre - Civil War brotherhood among cadets at West Point. the movie makes no real mention of this, except to mention Henry A. DuPont, first graduate of the May Class ; and George Custer, last grad of the June Class. I really enjoyed this film because I have a tremendous interest in American History... the Antebellum years and the Civil War in particular. In fact, Stuart and Custer were never friends, but enemies during the War.",1
"The film's villain.. and his motives for feeding a synthetically made biological creature.. certainly provides a different take on the Frankenstein formula. This is the kind of B - horror item you'd find packaged in with 50 other random cheesefests and poverty row programmers. I'm certain the film's print has seen better days, though. < br / > < br / > Creaky, static, but rather entertaining nonetheless thanks to the cast.

"< br / > < br / > Overall, for fans of old horror films, this is excellent and worth seeing. Years ago, I found a "" bargain bin "" copy of this film for a buck or two. Adding to this familiarity is Dwight Frye. For people who are NOT fans of the genre, it's probably pretty skip - able.",1
Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye make a good comedy team. So try to see the this version if possible. The concoction works. It seems a vampire is loose in a small German town draining its victims of their blood.,1
"Story takes place in the small German town of Klineschloss where the bodies have been piling up completely drained of blood and with suspicious puncture marks. With that, this is still worth everyone's time and it's a heck of a lot of fun to view and in my opinion it's better than most of what is supposed to pass nowadays as horror! One Burgermister Gustave Schoen ( Lionel Belmore ) shouts "" It's Vampires "" but the local police chief Karl Brettschneider ( Melvyn Douglas ) thinks it's a madman who's responsible and he vows to catch him.",1
Mysterious murders in a European village seem the result of THE VAMPIRE BAT horde plaguing the terrified community. Elderly Lionel Belmore plays village's terrified burgermeister. Beautiful Fay Wray plays his assistant in a role which requires her to do little more than look lovely & alarmed.,1

"Come Oscar time, Mol, Turner, and Harron should be receiving nominations.",1
"She wants to be an actress, but she has to pay bills too. But it curses the film as well, because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on. < br / > < br / > I feel the briefness of the film ( just over ninety minutes ) is both a curse and blessing for it. I have never been a fan of Mol, but I cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes. I am not going to lie. It does not feel rushed ; it just does not feel all there. On one hand, the film never overstays its welcome. It begs for longer sequences, and begs more for even longer explanations.",1
"Greetings again from the darkness. Her smile is captivating and her body is flawless. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers. < br / > < br / > As one would expect, the soundtrack from the era is terrific. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page.",1
Great acting on the part of Gretchen Mol. This film is an excellent break from the Dir.,1
"But the delicate hand of the director is more palpably felt during Page's times of despair. You allow the character to drift back and forth between the healing forgiveness of the power of God and the church and the seductive illusion of control and dominance afforded to Page during her years as a pinup model. Especially when that person eventually succumbed to a split personality disorder in her latter years as if to demonstrate her own point. If you're director Mary Harron, you don't shy away from showing the push / pull nature of THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE.",1
"Leon Bijou's soft, dewy, almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence.",1
"It is a bravura "" comeback "" from an undeserved semi - obscurity. Mol perfectly captures the essence of the woman as I have come to conceive her, no pun intended, ). < br / > < br / > What I will ramble on about for a moment is the splendid performance of Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page. Page's most intimate charms, but the fact remains that Mol thoroughly embodies spirit of Bettie Page in every way, shape, and form.",1
"< br / > < br / > Very soon, we go into flashback. Film can be a looking glass to see the world in a new light.",1
"If only modern pornography producers were like that, perhaps better porn would be a consequence! Page comes across as someone who enjoys her work and doesn't appear to be degraded by it. It also appeared to be much less harsh. < br / > < br / > There are many things I did not know about Page. Seeing this film, I am more knowledgeable about Page and in awe at her modesty, beliefs and demeanour.",1
"From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biopics are very posh right now. "" < br / > < br / > Everyone knows Bettie Page ( played by Mol ). This does not mean, however, that it is a bad movie. Whether you know her as an iconor a simple porn staryou know her.",1
It was later said that she had been over hyped. And for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive! Was it Mol or Theron? Oh yeah! I disagree.,1
The underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires all that evoked were completely lost on her. Bettie Page is simply being who she is. The film captured this quite nicely. No harm there.,1
"The story is rather cursory and we never feel that we truly get to know Bettie. Much like her photos, it's just an image. The film errs with the character of John Willie, played by Jared Harris. It does tend to exaggerate Bettie's notoriety.",1
"The idea for the movie started in 1993, but this was worth the wait. Some great costumes too.",1
What Page didn't realize is that in fact she would be just that when she arrived. < br / > < br / > Mol shines as legendary pin - up queen Bettie Page in a fine biopic.,1
"Page herself. Along with V for Vendetta, it is a movie about another time for our times. Ms. Harron has crafted a work of subtle subversion.",1
"She's not a simplistic character, even if at times her ideas of morality are questionable ( "" well, Adam and Eve were naked, weren't they? "" This adds a much needed comic relief to the film's otherwise usual nature. The movie, co - written and directed by American Psycho's Mary Harron, fleshes out the key parts of her life well enough. she comments a couple of times ). But there isn't much time given to explore more of what is merely hinted at, with Page and her complexities or her relationships or to sex and the fifties. Soon, she becomes the underground pin - up sensation, with bondage the obvious ( and "" notorious "" of the title ) trait attributed to her.",1
"< br / > < br / > Walking out of the film, all I could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s. Gretchen Mol looks just like Bettie Page and gives a very fine performance. I looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from film since its original showing at the Toronto Film Festival. S Senate investigation in the 1950s.",1
"It's shot in black and white for that 1950's nostalgia feel. And her body is as close to a replica of Page's as possible. This film is supposedly based on the book "" The Real Bettie Page "" by Richard Foster. Terrific casting. I would rate it a 7. Mol herself with the Bettie Page black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page.",1
"Rather like this film, in fact.",1
"Her acting career went nowhere, but her body brought her to the peak of fame in an admittedly fringe field. The problem is, it's emotionally rather flat. 7 / 10",1
"As America suffocates under new conservatism, this is a film needed more than ever.",1
"< br / > < br / > Intensely private, Bettie herself has not seen film yet. I hope you're happy wherever you are. If this doesn't put her back on the A - list, well I'll be a monkey's uncle. You were one helluva woman. I mean unfortunately she has never made it to Gwyneth status, though not for lack of talent.",1
"To watch Ms. Mol as Ms. 50'Miami comes alive in super - saturated, 16mm - style color. The real Bettie Page seems to scamper, smile and pose before us, and yet the effect is curiously lightweight, barely lewd and not at all dangerous. If this film strikes you ( as it did us and, apparently, others departing the theater ) as disappointingly thin, it may be because the subject herself is mildly disappointing.",1
"Two years passed and mostly everyone looks different, some for good and some for worse. < br / > < br / > Overall 8 - 9 / 10 While NightWing ( Dick Grayson ) comes to the rescue often. Over the Edge "" might be one of the greatest Batman episodes ever so make sure you check that out. I still enjoyed as much as I did the original though.",1
"Slowly, everyone grows up and goes away. It doesn't pander for tears or ask for sympathy. * * * from * * * * And Jodie's face at the ending speaks volumes.",1
So make sure that you watch it on TV or rent or buy the collectors edition because it is really good.,1
"I liked it... just that... i liked it, not like the animated series... i love it! My favorite character : Harley Quinn ( im in love for her ) They put an awesome episode for her : Mad love ( to me the best episode of this series ). ! The good thing about the joker is that it still mark Hamil voice.",1
"The art style is OK, but doesn't remind me of Batman anymore. The animation may be more consistent here than in B : TAS, but it definitely isn't as good. There are none! The villains'motives are pretty bad, too.",1
I just wish some of episodes could be longer. First of all I loved the idea of Robin leaving Batman to solve crime on his own. It was an interesting perspective to their relationship.,1
Nothing period. Glad indeed. Back Of Beyond is a likable. It makes one think. But this gal truly can act. Check it out!,1
Some have described it as disingenuous or cheesy.,1
"God have mercy on you. God sends no one to hell, not even you!",1
It's not at all hateful.,1
Blah!,1
i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie. it is a drama with comedic moments. i really in enjoyed watching this movie. i do think that it is worth chance.,1
"The film is ( of course ) dated but it captures a time we will never see again. They got the dialogue, clothes and attitudes down completely right. < br / > < br / > A very good movie - - essential viewing if you came of age in 1980. The film has a deserved R rating ( plenty of drug use and swearing ) but should be seen by all teens. I give it 8. I knew girls in high school who were just like this! Madge ( Marilyn Kagan ) has overprotective parents.",1
I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. I give it a strong 8 / 10.,1
"This Showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4. < Nevertheless, the denouement is great. Yeah, I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy / Drama under Genre. That sure is misleading, isn't it? < br / > < br / > Tom's obsession became a compulsion. 5 ; I gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars.",1
"He, of course is of a better calibre, his new neighbor is "" ghetto "" not an shouldn't be there! Wow. around them. It makes you question where does racism begin and end... and with whom. The only African Americans in the neighborhood at the time was the maids. < br / > < br / > Then the blending in began. < br / > < br / > But overall, this film is about'people '. One owning a home? It shows how no matter what colour you are and how much money you have, you can still shut yourself off from real world and helping those around you.",1
"this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue. the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for. animation wise this is pretty decent, good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well. knowing what's going on might somewhat increase appreciation.",1
< br / > < br / > - - PolarisDiB ). Possibly because of the title? There's an interesting sort of Genesis take. There's a pig that gets to eat itself. An elephant made of water.,1
"But hey, it's the world of art..!!",1
"Honest. This mind - tripping Asian short uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead.",1
Though it's not totally random. Cat Soup at first seems to be a very random animated film.,1
"Very artistic, odd and dark. But to some people it's probably not their cup of tea. But I didn't. < br / > < br / > Then the rest of the film is slightly lost to me, honestly. "". < br / > < br / > The animation is stunning. Her soul is split in half.",1
< br / > < br > Just be ready for some very strange images that will be burned into your memory forever. ( Certainly this is more alive than Destino which was directly based on his work ).,1
"Maybe you were one of those girls. If you weren't there, then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you. In this sense, it works. Let's face it - - in real life, we don't say things in an exacting or perfect way, even when we mean to. We all knew the boy - crazy one, the fashion plate whose vanity hides her fear of the world, her fear of acceptance. We all knew these girls in school, or at the very least knew of them. < br / > < br / > And therein is the core of the movie.",1
"Wow. Simply put, it's'Hello Kitty'without the'o '. It's populated with a very cute off - world bunch of characters that bend and flow with warped backgrounds.",1
Best animated movie ever made. I have related this journey to many things.,1
An must - see! It's Hello Kitty on acid! ). CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary manga Nekojiru.,1
"I'd like to find more works by whoever made this, and see them.",1
Second of all - - you need to do this. Third viewing : Rewatch without the commentary.,1
"Maybe it'because Marty has more experience at it than Andrew. Gender Bender sexes things up a bit for the x - files. An interesting thing about the Kindred's "" power of seduction "".",1
I love that final shot. Best yet.,1
The teaser is very fun with the close up of the eye and the reflection of the disco lights. Huh? Its very exciting. < br / > < br / > It turns out that'it'is both. It is entirely original. This is one of my favorite Season 1 episodes in fact. Anyway I give the episode a 9 out of 10.,1
Ignore any bad reviews you may hear.,1
Go check out.,1
"there's an episode on their love lives, jobs etc. The third follows their European tour. The second series sends the boys to try out different occupations.",1
So why not a 10? Nothing is perfect.,1
It was also true to the bone.,1
"< br / > < br / > The same is also true of the soundtrack. < br / > < br / > Of the various pieces, then, it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion. < br / > < br / > As for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them.

"No, not really. Here's to knowing he's getting the chance. The final "" twist "" doesn't get enough build up time to be shocking. Broken is no genre classic. Mayhem ensues. The biggest problem was that it actually would have worked better as a full - length feature. Think Long Kiss Goodnight meets The Matrix, written ten minutes after reading Fight Club.",1
"They are all guns and knives. The film is sharp and cool, it looks good and it feels like something big. These nasty guys and girls are larger than life. As two of the few speaking roles in film, it is up to them to carry the film. There is no way out.",1

"We're going to be drowning in crap! I've seen the box office. You're there for atmosphere, the mystery, and the guns. You're staying away in droves.",1
"Also, fans of Jim Jarmusch John Cassavetes will like this movie.",1
"go! Manages to seem both improvised, yet completely controlled.",1
Every moment with the large cast of actors felt like the truth being exposed in their daily usual lives. < br / > < br / > This movie must be seen.,1
PURE GENIUS!! 1 which has to go down in history has a classic. Please purchase this game as soon as possible.,1
This game ranks above all so far.,1
Don't miss out on best of the series.,1
"You also get to play as Chris Redfield, from Resident Evil 1. Code veronica's graphics are very good, the fire and rain effects are great looking. I give it a 10 out of 10.",1
"It also makes a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old Japan to incorporate Western technology. Definitely the perfect finale. The third, and final installment of "" Hanzo the Razor "" is the most concrete of them all. The "" training "" even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film.",1
8 / 10 This leads to Hanzo discovering a loan - sharking scheme and an orgy ring run by a blind monk. WHO'S GOT THE GOLD?,1
< br / > < br / > I'm going to miss him.,1
"Though neatly laden throughout with nice moments, a fair amount of action and a little sleaze, the film does lose a little from a relatively restrained approach. The film opens with Hanzos assistants scared by a ghost, and typically he decides straight away that he needs to have carnal knowledge of this ghost. There are shades of both prior films, the plotting, pace and smarts recall The Snare and when the film aims for sleaze it does very well, with a potently handled and impactful early interrogation sequence.",1
"I need to be honest. Specially Paco character. < br / > < br / > Now, these guys need to see a psychologist. Yeah, there is a lot of humor for all tastes. Jackass "" is like a walk in the park compared to this one.",1

Eric Phillips ( Don Wilson ) is an undercover cop in the near future. It is merely a chance to show off some cheapo LAWNMOWER MAN effects circa 1995. and shoot outs. Why the Academy failed to take notice is beyond me.,1
Wow.,1
"If I have a guess as to what it all adds up to, it would be a sly satire of the whole nature of artistic interpretation. And so on, and so on. Inside, we meet The Collector, an elderly man who has apparently devoted his life to the study of the six known existing paints of an obscure Impressionist - era painter, Tonnerre. < br / > < br / > I watched this a second time, so bizarre and powerful and indescribable it was, and so challenging to think or write about.",1
"An amazing film. At least for me. < br / > < br / > The film is about two narrators, one seen, one unseen.",1
"Jay Chou is comfortable in his role as a martial artist Fang Shi - jie since it's not the first time he fought using martial arts ( Curse of the Golden Flower anyone? It made the sport look good because of its charismatic characters, despite them dripping so much coolness and aloofness on the courts. This project was originally conceived as the movie version of popular Japanese manga SlamDunk! < br / > < br / > And I will stick my neck out to say that this movie is to basketball just as how Goal was to football.",1
"You've seen it all before, but it's the kind of stuff it never hurts to see again when it's done well. I expect he had good'assistants') - the script delivers and the presentation is slick and stylish. < br / > < br / > Since the film revolves around basketball, it's good that the scenes of basketball matches are suitably rousing. General success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same nefarious villain of before.",1
Very good! It was number something on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments.,1
< br / > < br / > A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court. The plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film. Recommended. It's quite entertaining even with a scatter - shot ending. I'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards end. A mess of genres but it's mainly based on Stephen Chow's genre mash - ups for it's inspiration.,1
"Action is tight and epic while comedy chokes on to the right places. < br / > < br / > 9 / 10 for you cast of Kung Fu Dunk. With that established, let us further into the movie. SPOILERS end < br / > < br / > I'm not even sure why you're reading this. Go ahead and watch it.",1
A love interest. I'd watch it again. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. Well choreographed and well shot. Come on. Really? Absolutely.,1
"I don't know the stars, or modern Chinese teenage music - but I do know a thoroughly entertaining movie when I see one.",1
I love the way I can't guess what's going to happen.,1
Mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama! What happened to them? Good or bad! Explaining just enough to stay excited! You will grow to love these characters! Maybe they will return in later episodes! Of course this show has some flaws! But it is a little inconsistent! Like Rose and her husband! It even saves some episodes from getting boring! And would be devastating!,1
"The nice thing about this series is that its totally new. Lost holds something interesting for everyone. The result of that is that its a series which does not let you go. Just read the persons who loved it, and you'll know why you want to watch it. The difference between season 2 and 3 however was huge. On a more sceptic note, the series went under a bit in season 2, probably due to its own success. They got that in season 3 and brings us a promising series future for season 4.",1
"Lost "" is pure genius. Hope they keep it up ( as I'm sure they do ).",1
LOST is a classic work of art. It is genius.,1
"The great Vincent Price has done many fantastic Horror films, some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all - time. Another must - see for my fellow Price fans. The Mad Magician "" of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor.",1
I absolutely love this show and cannot turn it off. I am totally and completely hooked. ! Lost is spellbinding!! I can't wait for next disc to arrive at my house.,1
Watch it to see magic of being lost in nowhere.,1
"I absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The plot got old after the first couple episodes... and MOST OF ALL.... The whole plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious, creepy, and exciting. Also, some of my favorite characters have left. Now, the 4th season.",1
"Possibly the greatest thing about'Lost'is the fact that we visit each character's life before the crash in a series of flashbacks. They discover a mysterious man who has a job to do. They pray for rescue. < br / > < br / > A group of over forty passengers struggle to cope after their plane crash - landed into a deserted island. This gives us more insight and, hence more suspense and excitement as the events unfold in the present.",1
so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait. ( i have a review on that too that you could check it out. ),1
? The acting throughout is excellent but why have 5 series'planned...,1
Some characters are very two dimensional. Every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure. Annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing. All in all its great show but not perfect.,1
"However, I tuned into episode one of Series 2 and was hooked all over again.",1
Hopefully all the hype won't spoil ending. An absolutely brilliant show.,1
"The plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick.",1
I think... ) with good and bad sides. ! A wide variety of people stuck on a island.,1
"< br / > < br / > If I can recommend one television series you should be following right now, it would certainly be this one. Just be sure you start at the beginning. The narrative flows naturally, the dialogue is witty, the characters are memorable and the execution is superb. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear this isn't an ordinary island, either - and that they may not be alone.",1
"Despite this I decided to watch it, thinking it would be some new show I could laugh at. But I was seriously amazed.",1
That's the real secret.,1
"I enjoy watching TV again. The story is amazing and the show is highly addictive, but I love it. I am obsessed!",1
"I mean this is better than ALIAS, and I loved ALIAS. !",1
This is how it's so defiant of conventional TV.,1
A very addictive series.,1
"Wow was I surprised. Can you say gravity well, damn I got sucked in. After a few years I stumbled upon lost ; bored with the current sci - fi fare. Kate 1 step above them, Juliet was way more classy than Kate.",1
< br / > < br / > See this show. Complex. It does for dramatic /ci - fi television what Arrested Development did for comedy : it has set the bar. Epic.,1
"! But still, its the lowest ranked of all.",1
Who is Richard Alpert? What's the fog? Lost is the best TV series there is. I have confidence in the writers. How did the island disappear?,1
"There's hope somewhere. Lost, probably the best t. v series ever made. You see a major twist that can or will change everything. And if your hating or criticising Lost you don't know how to watch t. v or watch drama. Your heart beating. Lost is simply unbelievable, amazing, highly entertaining, top notch, t. v at it's best. Every thing happens for a reason. "" < br / > < br / > Lost beat's all other show's by a landslide. But it does! And that is truly shown in the series.",1
"The show, that is. The realism of these characters facilitate an already well - sculptured plot. Where did they come from? If you're a DOG you will have your own storyline.",1
"One amusing game you can play while watching "" Snakes "" is to place bets on which cars will land the farthest down the cliff. couldn't be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadence.",1
I have loved this movie since I first saw it in 1979. Highly recommended.,1
If this doesn't get released then we are gonna be Heartbreak Hotel. Why this hasn't had a Video or DVD release yet? Belting out most of Elvis's greatest hits with gusto. This is definitely a role he was born to play.,1
"movies. This movie is one of those "" WOW! """,1
"< br / > < br / > Long live King! Kurt Russell IS Elvis, plain and simple.",1
"It's much more enjoyable on big screen than on TV. Especially at Christmas time, because there also appears a "" MC Santa Claus "".",1
You can feel Larry's pain after It's wonderful and really heartfelt and real. I would say watch this movie if you ever get the chance. I even put my mothers photo at eye level so i could freeze frame it and show it to her when we watched it. I also had a big hand in decorating the bar where Larry encounters the magical bartender Mr. Destiny.,1
"I'm just glad that I hadn't read any reviews of "" Mr. Destiny "" before seeing it. Wonderful choice of music, too. Michael Caine is superb as the sympathetic bartender. Taken on its own terms, "" Mr. Destiny "" is an enjoyable, well - made, funny, and moving film. If that somehow makes me a "" lowbrow, "" so be it! The performances are excellent throughout, and the movie was very well cast.",1
However it's an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just don't think too much in it.,1
This movie teaches you that life isn't always so bad after all. ! This is Belushi's pinnacle movie in my opinion. Very Very underrated movie here folks.,1
"If you were on it, you were "" all that. "" Then, he gets a chance to find out.... and gets a little more than he bargained for. That was in 1987. It has been some years since I saw this, but remember it and would like to see it again. It kind of became a "" therapy "" for me with a personal experience of my own. ! Who knows, it could have changed the course of events to the point that I wouldn't have met my son's father. This team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school.",1
It also reminds us to be careful what we wish for.,1
Then one night his car breaks down again. then chances are you would avoid this film anyway.,1
"It was shown in a party at my school. If you like big films, this one is not for you. It's not a big film. Nothing really inventive or new. Watch it.",1
"In this case we are shown a businessman named Larry ( James Belushi ). He hates his life. In fact, Larry even makes a comment about never seeing the bar before. Would have been. Mr. Destiny - 3.",1
"Everyone plays their part pretty well in this "" little nice movie "".",1
Michael Caine is perfect as the bartender. It's < br / > < br / > just a good movie with a good lesson.,1
Spoiler!!! I give it a 7 out of 10. This movie is based on the concept of What If?,1
A very pleasant film!,1
"Belushi at his most ingratiating and Courtney Cox before Friends has a small role. Nevertheless, a nice way to spend two hours.",1
"Belushi is having a rotten 35th birthday. So check this out for a fun exploration of "" what if? "" Though similar, both films are on the same level of laughs provided. He heads into an empty bar to call for a tow.",1
Among those greats is this little gem.,1
"Without doubt Beat Street is the best film about the breakin scene. The storyline is basic, but hey whats there to tell a story about?",1
"It's his brother ( Elias Koteas ) who stole show for me though. Great cast, great film.",1
"He just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to "" G. Q. "" It has nothing to do with Koteas'acting ability.",1
The story - amazing. I recommend this movie ( and book ) very very much.,1
"As for those who claim to prove, statistically, that such is not an effective deterrent?",1
Let's get it out! Another rave of the Mick's intense and sympathetic performance. This is a great film and unjustly buried film.,1
Great group of actors.,1
"If anyone out there remembers this film the same as I do? For this picture etched in my heart alone I gave it a 10 just on face of his performance. But unfortunatly not recently. His answer was, "" Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney "" I was stunned, but not surprised. At least a Dozen. I would be interested in hearing from you. This film, "" The Last Mile "" should be seen by all acting students. < br / > < br / > I have seen this movie many times.",1
"Have just finished watching this film, which upset me greatly. < br / > < br / > Will never be able to view Nigel Hawthorne the same again.",1
"That was one of the reasons why "" Beat Street "" was better. And I loved all of them. I guess when "" Beat Street "" made a national appearance, "" Flashdance "" came at the same time.",1
"I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for. This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. Do not look for humor in this film, there is none.",1
Check this out.,1
"With the right exposure in right circles, the film could develop quite a cult following, along with the original "" Scanners "". so much fun to watch! As sequels usually go, it was utterly fantastic ( despite a "" cookie cutter "" approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie verbatum. < br / > < br / > The film had a positive message, and was fun to watch.",1
"But because I've enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films, I gave it a shot. Guess which one wins. His eyes are ruined pits.",1
My rating : 7 out of 10.,1
"I loved this film. I did. Of course, the cheese factor is high. Strange comics. Well, wouldn't you know it?",1
A good way to spend an evening. ( And is absolutely adorable. ) Plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt.,1
"Anyway - it's a shame they didn't have bucks to license Dr. No, seriously! It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s.",1
It is a piece of American history.,1
"Basically, this a film that's just plain fun to watch. Plus, the settings were wonderful. Overall, this a great film ; it was fun to watch, and the main actors put a lot of feeling into their roles. It was definitely money well - spent )! I really enjoyed "" Doctor Mordrid "". But I digress... < br / > < br / > My Rat He even has a pet raven that he keeps in his apartment named Edgar.",1
"Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? I give it a 20 out of 10. The film focused on plot and that's what I like! Worth seeing!",1
Wow! The story turns and twists and the audience can never predict what will happen next. < br / > < br / > The acting was strong across the board with a very interesting international cast. I have to admit that Holly was not on my watch list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. The Asian cast was also superb. Speaking about an emotional roller coaster.,1
"A mine is set off by a cow and the truck driver believes she is dead, so Holly is then left on her own. While on a journey, his motorbike runs out of fuel, and he is forced to rent a room at a brothel. She is the voice of millions of children who are exploited and violated every year with no rights or protection. Holly then shows her willingness to leave this lifestyle but her confusion on what is right and wrong. "" Holly and Patrick begin a friendship of trust and understanding.",1
"What a powerful and moving story! I had the privilege of watching "" Holly "" at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. When Holly is sold again, Patrick desperately searches for her.",1
"I also felt Ron Livingston played a very difficult role well. I won't explain it here - go see the movie. < br / > < br / > Anyway, on with the review.",1
"She is a young girl, he is a worn out westerner. The film is beautifully shot. Brilliant!",1
"Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. Everyone should go see this film. I think this film will make a difference, I loved it!",1
"I can honestly say that I have never seen audiences more moved. It presents the issue of child sexual exploitation in a way that is both educational and accurate. From purely an artistic and cinematic perspective, it is amazing. I have to say that Holly blew Trade out of the water.",1
"It is amazing and I recommend it to anyone! All I can say is "" Wow "".",1
"! Being that I am a true product of the hip - hop and electronic dance music generation, this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time.",1
"Holly "" is an issue - driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. Kudos to those who managed to get it made.",1
I found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause. If I had wanted a cheap laugh I would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking.,1
It's GREAT and a film EVERYONE must see.,1
I hope that this kind of ending rings true in actually for many. I LOVED GOOD TIMES with the rest of many of you. The writers on THIS show were fantastic and the Actors were beyond TALENTED. I love reading INTELLIGENT and INSIGHTFUL commentary. < br / > < br / > A great show and many other great shows followed including Benson and The Jeffersons.,1

I really liked Tom Barman's AWTWB.,1
"This gives the movie a very relaxing feel to it. Just as simple as that, and he succeeded. in a beautiful, smooth way. He knows people..... and Antwerp. I simply don't think that that was Barman's idea. Was it the runtime, which was breaking me up?",1

You don't have total story, but only fragments. But, after I watch it, I didn't get this feeling of "" sickness "" which I would surely have regarding society rules. You feel the connection. It's a strange, yet somehow impressive story, about love. < br / > < br / > The movie focuses mostly on relation between Kiki and Alex.",1

"Actually Bacall and Hudson characters don't interest Sirk. They are too straight, too virtuous. Then there was silence.",1
She marries Stack. In other words the James Dean part without the James Dean racism from Giant.,1
"Her Oscar was well deserved. Mitch is not from a wealthy home. < br / > < br / > Kyle Hadley has it all.

"< br / > < br / > Well worth watching with some interesting performances from entire cast. They play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding. < br / > < br / > The film she's in is not quite up to Oscar standards, but it is a strong enough melodrama under Douglas Sirk's capable hands.",1
"Its a crime that he did not. Amazing how he humanizes a rich worthless character. One - dimensional, 100 - percent soaper. You will be entertained!",1
"And of course, it's all captured in vibrant Technicolor. His was a unique talent and I don't know that there's ever been another film maker quite like him since.",1
< br / > < br / > The story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthwhile as most dramas. Lauren Bacall was living through husband Humprey Bogarts illness & death when she did this film. Rock Hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom. Robert Stack is nominated & falls just short for his role.,1
"Written on the Wind "" is a Douglas Sirk's melodrama. Why? - well, when I read the story summary on the back cover of the DVD I thought that I was in for a treat.

"Written on the Wind "" was an enormously successful Universal picture. Mr. Sirk couldn't care less about realism as long as he could tell the story his own way. Most of the decor is phony.",1
They counterbalance the somewhat bland leads. It's well worth it.,1
"I think Robert Stack's might have been a Masseratti. Was Loren's part considered a leading role? Rock Hudson's character told his father he was taking a job in Iraq, isn't that timely? An ancient morality tale. But seriously, what were those sports cars?",1
"< br / > < br / > Fun, glossy trash. Don't miss! He marries her and is so happy he stops drinking.",1
"You just see reflections. Nobody can say that the Hadley are real people. Sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same time. Sirk never tried to show reality, on the contrary. One ends up giving up.",1
"For me watching this film conveys well claustrophobia that I would feel during my half - year stay there, feeling trapped and limited. A bit shabby housing project style is how I'd describe it, and this is how many people live on the outskirts of larger cities. I saw this film at the Chicago Reeling film festival. I can't say that I'm familiar with Bucharest, Romania where the action unfolded, but I have visited and lived in Eastern Europe for six months.",1
"I doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was. Sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players. Kyle's sister, Marylee ( Dorothy Malone ), is a drunken slut who's in love with Mitch. Mitch wants nothing to do with her. The director had a gift for this type of movie, and though he had many imitators, he never had an equal. Stack plays the deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil tycoon. They both love the same woman, Lucy, ( Lauren Bacall ), who becomes Kyle's wife.",1
"The 1956 potboiler, adapted from Robert Wilder's novel, was a veritable three - ring - circus showcasing alcoholism, greed, impotence and nymphomania. < br / > < br / > An extremely erudite man, Sirk made a name for himself in the 1950's as Universal Studios'reliable director of lavish soap operas, most notably with Ross Hunter's productions of MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION, ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS and IMITATION OF LIFE.",1

She is so perfect in this movie. I think the title especially put me off. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. This film is easily my top ten favorites of all time. I could have kept watching for hours.,1
The film's star Ashley Judd has not yet made a better film than her debut here.,1
This will be a different kind of review. The plot speaks less to me than the surroundings.,1
"This was the first movie I ever saw Ashley Judd in and the first film of Victor Nunez'that I ever say, and boy am I glad I did.",1
! < br / > < br / > This movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his / her way. For any woman NOTE : This isn't an action movie!!,1
The background music makes you realize the easiness of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness. I cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is.,1
"Except for the 80's looking clothes, it has held up very nicely. This is not an action film, nor is it really a romance. Boy, talk about failing to fulfill your early promise!",1
"My vote is ten. When Maria escapes to Rio de Janeiro expecting a better life, she is explored by the cáften Vera ( Darlene Glória ). The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic.",1
"They are both terrific 1950s horror films. One thing you can't say about this film is that it is dull. < br / > < br / > My advice is to see this film AND HOUSE OF WAX ( the Price version only ). As a result, Price justifiably kills the evil man.",1
I first saw this film when i was about 13.,1
ta and peace a worrying idea.,1
I didn't when finally in South Africa in 1993.,1
n i have just finished watching this film in my GCSE history class. He and Steve Biko formed a very strong friendship that shook south Africa and went on to awaken the world.,1
What a thrilling situation. I have to watch it at least once a week. I wish he was my own brother. Denzel's movies are all full of lessons for people of walks of life.,1
Of course he has achieved it. That is the hallmark of a great film. I couldn't. Unless you happen to support apartheid. It was obviously the intention of Sir Richard Attenborough to get this message over about South Africa.,1
"But, the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. "" "" Cry Freedom "" is not just a movie.",1
This is a film that everyone should watch.,1
"Biko replies "" Well you and I are in confrontation now, but I see no violence!! """,1
I give it a 7.,1
"But sometimes sacrifices must be made ( Biko's death ) so truth could be reveled ( Woods book ). Woods writes several articles, where he speaks critically about views of Steve Biko ( Denzel Washington ). What is "" Cry Freedom "" like?",1
"* * * of 4 stars. Film politics aside, the film still entertains and sends a message or two, albeit, in PG - sanitized fashion. In that case, Biko dies in vain.",1
"It could not be. A remake is necessary. A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. His life and his teaching is reduced to little, at best a few witty remarks.",1
Cry Freedom'is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth.,1
"The second half of the movie is a gripping tale of his escape from South Africa, along with his family, and will keep you on tenterhooks. Lawyer : Well, isn't that violence, Mr. Biko? Washington exudes a natural charm and screen presence, which Biko's character required. Biko : Not necessarily. I cannot imagine a better choice for the role. Biko : I advocate a confrontation. The I didn't know of any other work of his till i recently came across'Cry Freedom ', released back in 1987.",1
What a brilliant film. The opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot. Out the < br / > < br / > Cry Freedom visually looks amazing. But neither of these pointers are flaws in any way. And the two men's chemistry is believable and never strikes a false note.,1
Little did we know what we were about to experience. < br / > < br / > I think it served it's purpose in my case. < br / > < br / > I first saw this film the year of it's release around 1987.,1
"The authorities try to hush up the matter because Biko has become a huge personality in South Africa. Kevin Kline gives a great performance in this second half too. What a movie! It starts as a difficult friendship, for Woods sees Biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites. It has in fact two narratives : first it narrates the life and death of Biko. But through the efforts of Woods the truth comes out. Plus he's constantly spied by the police.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film takes place in the late 1970's, in South Africa. The films uses Wood's two books for it's information and basis - "" Biko "" and "" Asking for Trouble "". Then we are introduced to Donald Woods ( Kevin Kline ), who is the editor of a popular newspaper. Soon, Steve Biko is arrested and is killed in prison. After publishing a negative story about black activist Steve Biko ( Denzel Washington ), Woods goes to meet with him. So "" The True Story Of The Friendship That Shook South Africa And Awakened The World. "" But it's more about the story of Donald Woods and his journey across the border into Lesotho as he tried to elude the South African officials.",1
Thousands of people in both films. 8 out of 10. What is amazing is how he manages to control all extras.,1
Woods achieved little. Viewing Cry Freedom in this light is deeply ironic - - - actually tragic. The ANC has transformed itself from being the solution to being primary problem.,1
"7 / 10. Overall, a well made film that could have been trimmed down a bit.",1
The last scene gut - wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters.,1
"And yes I did miss another international South African drama, MANDELA and DEKLERK. Now twelve years after movie's production, CRY FREEDOM is in many ways a more interesting film to watch. It is the whites who have always been the film's and the book's target audience, hopefully driving them to change. Though this ( also highly recommended ).",1

"In both pictures, there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters. Please see also my comment on Die Nibelungen part 1 : Siegfried. The point is that Lang never manipulates us into taking sides, and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the Wagner opera. Now, with this focus on mass action, Lang is presented with greater challenges in staging.",1

"This short does a good job of putting human characteristics on little creatures such as riding motorcycles, painting, filming, kissing, and dancing. Starewicz would also make Frogland ( 1922 ) and The Mascot ( 1933 ) but his first notable work would be this one.",1
"Starewicz's twist on the story is to use embalmed beetles with wires straightening the legs in frame - by - frame animation. The story builds as Mr. Beetle is unknowingly caught on camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper. Action happens with intricate detail, but rapidity and a quicker pace of filming is lost in the process. Despite its pace, the film is an excellent example of Starewicz's early puppetry and is highly recommended.",1
"Personally, I prefer straightforward - - and spicier - - Russian story ; the BFI version tries to cram too much The other, Russian print, tells a simpler story of married beetles who are each guilty of infidelity.",1
"This is certainly among her better films. OK, I've vented about Ben and the chocolate lab!",1
Well said! Needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning. He has also drawn brilliantly natural performances from all his players.,1
"The themes would have rung true and deep at the time. This is not a'Christiany'film, it is not selling anything. NY Times 1922. < br / > < br / > Thus there was an ongoing battle between church and the film industry during the early days of film.",1
TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is possibly the best movie of all of Mary Pickford's films. characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past.,1
"A rich old crank builds a mansion at the top of a hill next to the river. The very final scene is also pretty cute. < br / > < br / > The film excels in some ways. So he tries to come up with a variety of ways to get them off the land. The man accused of the murder is dear old Mary's father, though he is innocent. But, I just can't see how so many have given this film a 10.",1
Love this movie! The ending was so sad.,1
I had no idea what I was in for. You would have to see her again and again. Very few are hypnotic to me. I had never seen a movie with Mary Pickford in it. I've seen thousands of movies.,1
"Hersholt, a very gentle soul off screen, manages brilliantly to depict his character's complete moral corruption. Both films were very popular at box office. < br / > < br / > Mary Pickford is utterly charming in this splendid, heart - wrenching film. He mimes it < br / > < br / > This was actually the second time Pickford filmed TESS. Uneducated & defiant, beautiful TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is the daughter of a fisherman squatting on a rich man's land. The atmospherics are first - rate, with the outdoor fishing village sets being particularly well - conceived. The end result certainly lived up to her expectations.",1
She does so with spunk not seen in many heroines of the time. Pickford's close ups are wonderful. Here is proof of why Mary Pickford was ` America's Sweetheart. < br / > < br / > Danish - born Jean Hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain. Recommended. She is even willing to take a bath.,1
! Plus the bomb blast scene is very real. < br / > < br > Casting is great!!,1
He also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich families. She is likely to be noticed for this role. What's new? Is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press?,1
Page 3 is a great movie.,1
This film was great. < br / > < br / > Konkona Sen Sharma is grace.,1
"And a remarkable one it is, literally and figuratively.",1
Omigosh! There were a few flaws visible. That may spoil your mood. At the end she is back to Page 3. The audience needs to get it in their own color. That scene looks very unprofessional. Madhur Bhandarkar has given it all raw. The theme and the screenplay was fantastic.,1
"Nonetheless, it's a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later.... a year later maybe. For how long? Is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car? For such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long?? Andie MacDowell's facial expressions are great again in this movie.",1
"Please don't afford to miss it. Even she is fired from the job. I would recommend all to see the movie. The movie is a very perfect mixture of emotions, drama and entertainment.",1
It leaves a lasting impression in the end. There are still some scenes that make you think of more depths.,1
""".",1
She observes the suffocating atmosphere and the mind - boggling frenzy that the socialites live in. Terrific film with excellent character development!,1
"In fact the film would have us believe that this exposure MAKES celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this. She is shown as this celebrity maker, very popular at the social gatherings. < br / > < br / > Celebrities party endlessly, they like to be seen at these parties, and to get due exposure in the media. This is what saves film for me. But the supporting cast is more than competent ( Boman Irani is very good ).",1
"Atul Kulkarni ' The film's writing is quite good. They are attention seeking, salacious and hypocrite. Otherwise the soundtrack is bad. This film is all about tabloid journalism, gossip, celebrities.",1
"They came and went. The movie shows it boldly, no holds barred. Seems real. < br / > < br / > But Page - 3 is nicely made.",1
The Write Word < br / > < br / > What you see is what you get. And therein lays the film's appeal. Bhandarkar cleverly avoids that. Not really! < br / > < br / > The page 3 phenomenon is as deplorable as it is enigmatic.,1
By that time Sinatra had enough credits'under his belt'to do just that!,1
This film is fun. - - she's selected to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba. For some reason - - oh it is explained!,1
What fun!,1
"Ship Ahoy "" was probably made in order to showcase MGM talent.",1
"DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SERIES! ! This film will either make you hate this movie, or like Krueger even more.",1
"And that's, in my opinion, exactly the point. The nightmare scenes are all great. For me, Freddy is the boogeyman! Beside the story of Freddy's past, I also really liked the atmosphere of the movie. It doesn't have the same atmosphere than the previous films.",1

We also get to see some of FREDDY's eerie backgrounds. So this film is really a comdey sore to speak.,1
"And Freddy belts out the funny one - liner, "" Great graphics. "" And who can forget the cameos? Of course it could have. Is it one of the best of the "" Nightmare "" series?",1

"If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the film for you!",1
"Owners, PLEASE PLEASE release it. I would buy it immediately.",1
But the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise. < br / > < br / > A delightful pleasant simple romantic - comedy that deserves to be seen by more! Their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two.,1
"Unfortunately they were largely right in this instance. The sort of feel that is impossible to describe, but it's not a good one.",1
This was an excellent film.,1
Keep in mind the main premise of this film is friendships and the ending shows us exactly that. As I'm sure most are just unearthing the film now.,1
And again to cover that one up.,1
And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean seems very sweet.,1
"Wow, whoa now.",1
). In a way it's a slacker movie for girls.,1
It has some really funny parts. lang. Hilarious actually. Get a GRIP people.,1
I truly am a fan. < br / > < br / > I suggest reading the book! This is what I believe happened here.,1
"Be it for the courage, or be it for unique sense of humor. This movie is not entertainment, at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It's just a story, a very weird one I admit, but after all, only a weird story.",1
"Highly recommended! The box is falling apart, and I am surprised that the tape still works! Although it is not'Finding Nemo'quality graphics, it is still very good. This unique collaboration takes you on an incredible voyage into "" The Mind's Eye. """,1
"In that sense it is much the same appeal as Midsomer Murder or a Miss Marple mystery, without the mayhem. Kenny Doughty as Jed Willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star, even though he keeps his pants on.",1
"High recommended! The box is falling apart, and I am surprised that the tape still works!",1
"If you know any child that wants to get involved in computer animation, this is a MUST HAVE.",1
Actually I'd love to be part of it. - yup you did. I mean really?,1
Wow! But this film was a landmark in the early'90s.,1
"I thought it was good and quite interesting in spots. Stoners must have really loved this. This is all about visuals, not really about any kind of a story. No words, just pictures with electronic music. All of it is computer animated which was new back then.",1
"Well, well.... Roeg touched a bit of a nerve there, didn't he? But they probably won't. Sure, this film has some problems, notably Talia Shire's delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun, 1950s - style attire and all.",1
"Nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama. It is workmanlike shooting, but subdued. 'All of these are films with a trick up their sleeves. < br / > < br / > What this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith. It is a simple story that unfolds simply.",1
In fact I loved being an actress in this movie. I loved this movie.,1
Also starring Elizabeth Hartman. Quite funny.,1
"Yes, I thought Andy MacDowell was great. < br / > < br / > The casting was excellent.",1
"Arkin ( H20 : Halloween, 20 Years Later ) shows nice timing in the lead role. < br / > < br / >'Full Moon High'is not often talked about but it is a silly and entertaining horror spoof. McMahon ) leaves him with a wicked case of the furballs.",1
"It'just funny, watch it!!!",1
"Frustrated, he flees town. It all culminates during the schools big football game. But I was surprised that the film was actually, legitimately funny.",1
"After his father unfortunately dies in a mishap within his bomb shelter (! ) What was once a very white, clean - cut high school has indeed changed into a ghetto of drug use, violence, and perversion. ). Brand ( Alan Arkin, who steals the film when Kenneth Mars isn't on screen ), quite possibly the worst psychiatrist on Earth.",1
"The ironic tone is very similar to that of "" Back to the Future. "" SILLY? Anyway, I laughed out loud more for this movie than any other I can think of. < br / > < br / > The humor is very Mel Brooks - ish, and anyone who loves Jewish humor or watches a lot of B - movies What is a comedy supposed to be - serious?! I'm not kidding about that summary and vote!",1
"They don't peak my interest. All I hear is "" worst movie ever "". Is it low budget? I don't know what's up with all these bad reviews for this film. Why? knowing that you don't like this type of stuff? I like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice!",1
"But a funny thing happens on the way to the morgue. Welcome to Oakland, where the dead come out to play and even the boys in DA hood can't stop them. But low budgets don't necessarily mean bad films.",1
I'm glad I listened. That's what makes this original Zombie movie so good. Go rent it! Everything they did was so damn original. One of coolest scenes was a half eaten cat. 10 out of 10!,1
"There have been "" race "" pictures almost from the beginnings of the movie business. When first confronted with a zombie, Scott tells Ricky, "" Shoot him in the head like Along the way, they also add in a few interesting bits of business. Apparently his efforts are for naught, and Jermaine's body is taken away. Ed and Jose Quiroz's Hood of the Living Dead, adopts the recent popularity of horror movies for the hip - hop audience.",1
"Enjoy! Made me laugh, made me sad.",1
"I'll be honest. It came awfully close. I got this movie so I could make fun of it. Yes, it could have been better. No, it ain't great.",1
"You ever watch "" ZOMBIEZ ""???? Thumbs up from me and I'd also like to see sequel. Or "" Feardotcom ""????? I just had fun with it. I thought it was a cool little movie. Or "" House Of The Dead ""???? I wasn't disappointed at all. Of course not!",1
I don't want to say all the acting was bad. I liked this movie. I gave it an 8.,1
"Jaysun Barr ( Guy on Bench - 2005 ) The title really captures immediate interest in the more urban markets. I was amazed how well they accomplished capturing all the identifiable traits of a true "" B "" horror film. One time was actually in the video store and the girl damn near lost her mind.",1
Usually how it goes with all movies. It's hard to keep up. All we are doing here is giving opinions. I really liked this one. I'm a horror movie fan.,1
"Cheap? Jordan replied, "" No, that's gang dress. < White t - shirts on everyone so blood shows up. Chaos and mayhem! I used the same technique in my own low - budget horror film. "" Hood of the Living Dead had a lot to live up to even before the opening credits began. He dreams of moving out of Oakland. Oh. ) < br / > < br / > Zombie explanation : When man plays God, zombies arise!",1
"I personally like to laugh, and love movies that make me to, be they comedies or horror flicks. This is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place. We already know it. However, it is the third point that leaves totally baffled. Why don't people blame those clips for bad acting and non - existing plot?",1
- and the movie left us wanting more. They have great chemistry together ( I guess being married in real life helps that! ),1
"Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and a crap load of kids that look nothing like either of them. It's also not great film to promote happy families. There are some great pretty! eyes. < br / > < br / > But, hey! This concludes my review of'Step By Step... on some really bad drugs. Rob Estes!",1
Recommended as a feel good movie for all ages.,1
I really truly enjoyed this movie.,1
"The film stars Rosemary Dexter, who provides eye candy throughout and also delivers a good performance. The film does explain itself at the end ; which is lucky as I'm sure I'm not the only viewer who was more than a little confused by then! Overall, this may not be classic stuff ; but its good enough and worth seeing.",1
"In true giallo style, murder is never far away. < br / > < br / > The cast is really rather good. This little seen movie is a languid and laid - back giallo.",1
"Recommended! Giallo fans, seek out this rare film.",1
Why did they cut it off??? ? It was the best TV show in the world. By night cybersix patrols the city. i love this TV series so much.,1
"rescuing Molly, and end ). The dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving, but feuding family. Betcha never thought they feel the same way about you! < br / > < br / > Wonderful, wonderful family film. I do love Chance, and how at the end he says that he has a family at last. I love all three of the animals. I give this 9 / 10.",1
I am a fan of animal movies. It is very much an archetypal movie. It was a complete success. Homeward Bound did just this.,1
"< br / > < br / > A favourite for all time - anyone who doesn't like this film must just not like animals. Chance - who wouldn't love a dog like Chance? He's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen. This movie is a true masterpiece, it really is.",1
And when I watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh.,1
"Certainly, any animal - loving child will do so. Shadow, a golden retriever, is the wise, experienced older dog ; Chance the younger one is brash, cocky and impulsive. ). < br / > < br / > This story might have been most easily filmed as a cartoon, but both versions are in fact live - action films made using real animals. < br / > < br / > Both dogs are male, and their relationship parallels that between many humans in "" buddy - buddy "" movies.

"Somehow, it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story. SPOILERS ALERT < br / > < br / > Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey is an important film from my life because it's the first film I remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4 - year old scamp.",1
"I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful, and warm. Andie MacDowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable.",1
"All in all, a charming and perhaps underrated film, with a 9 / 10 from me. Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche.",1
The cat is named Sassy and she lives up to her name. It's a really good movie for families. Shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things.,1
"Or at least that's the message I gained from it. This is one of my favorite family movies. I really holds that great message that "" Home is where heart is. """,1
Robert Hays is Bob Seaver. The bear scene is exiting and funny. Also the visible actors are great. Jean Smart portrays Kate.,1
"Hats off to Disney. Definitely perfect for an evening alone or with kids. Sally Field is lovable in anything, but really shines in this film as the proud feline, Sassy. There's even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery.",1

For once an original film is improved by a remake as voice - over for the first has been removed. Put humans in the same position ant the helicopters would be out. It also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking abilities.,1

"Fox, respectively. Just a remake, I don't think so! This one crosses that border with flying colors. Still, I thoroughly recommend both films. There is a bit of scatological humor, but nothing extreme. < br / > < br / > There is virtually nothing offensive in the film. This update is more epic and cinematic.",1
A very good effort. 5 / 10!,1
"this movie is best i love it and everyone should! ! my favorite character is shadow. Love your pets no matter what they do, cherish them forever!",1
"And it has my favorite actor, Michael J. A truly incredible journey. Even when people hum it. But what if it isn't? Fox.",1
"Voiced by Michael J. I give this movie solid 9 out of 10! It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll put you into suspense. < br / > < br / > This movie is also very sad at times. It's a real pleaser to anyone.",1
For a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while. The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect. There is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at age of 15.,1

I found this film to be the usual French slap in America's face.,1
"I just love Malle's documentaries. And the change is great. The Up series are about people. It's horrible. """,1
"Revenge is the theme of this Denzel Washington thriller that offers its share of action, mayhem, murder and grisly bloodletting.",1
One would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in Man On Fire. Both this movie and Deja Vu are better thrillers you can expect. It's a success that they created a super - dark Mexico city with a lot of shits happening.,1
"Everything is portrayed brilliantly. There are so many emotions thrown into this film. Sorrow, love, laughter, anger.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I wish I'd got the chance to see this on the big screen. This film should have been huge, given his status and the strength of his performance, and quality of the film.

"< br / > < br / > You must see this movie. Yes, he has become... a Man on Fire.",1
"For the moviegoer, it's a moving, violent story of love and human redemption. For the film critic, there's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit. It's hard to top this movie in several ways.",1
"10 / 10 Man on fire, is definitely one of the best drama / crime thrillers I have ever seen. As I said the story is somewhat complicated, in order to fully understand it, you must watch it a couple of times. And even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality.",1
"This comment does contain spoilers!! Terry. "" I think George Clooney has it and so does Jack Nicholson. It's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great. He has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with life that he has led. These guys just have it.",1
I highly recommend this movie. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. I would have loved to see more of both of them.,1
Man on Fire was hot. His death was noble in fact. < br / > < br / > Denzel does an excellent job as do the writers. < br / > < br / > Creasy's quest ended with the return of Pita to her mother and Creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys.,1
"This is where Creasy really shows the person he can become. I've watched it several times now. Man On Fire was one of those movies. I watched it, and witnessed such a beautiful movie.",1
< br / > < br / > The cast was also very good.,1
"One day Pita is kidnapped and Creasy is badly injured in the process. The only problem is the annoying visual style, which will either make you hate the movie or hate Tony Scott.",1
"Creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety. Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow. So far, he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the Bible and not doing all that well with either. You know you're in for something different when a movie has Christopher Walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he isn't even one of the bad guys! Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie.",1
"With almost any other stock action hero ( Schwarzenneger ; Segal, etc. ), the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before. But Washington's character, though he's killing for a reason, does not particularly enjoy doing what he does. Although released among a flock of revenge - minded action flicks ( KILL BILL VOL.",1
"The rest of the movie was of marvel, I have it in my collection.",1
'will god ever forgive us for what we've done? i liked this film a lot.,1

"The Australian coast scenery is, simply, splendid to see.",1
"It is also the name of an Australian film that used the beach as a location. Marcie sees them as a'Romeo and Juliet'romantic couple. I would think that this character is the main comic element. Much as life itself, there are also moments of sadness too. The viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal, and concentrate on the plot, not the copious amount of flesh. Simon is just bored with it all.",1

"But is that a bad thing? Because Freewheelers harks back to a bygone ( dare I say "" golden "" ) age of kids'TV drama, when the shows were simply about rip - roaring fun and didn't take themselves so seriously. And watching it again brought a nostalgic lump to the throat.",1
"I saw it during my 14 - 16s. Ah, true memories. Greetings from Canada. Even the bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch. I lived in Holland at the time and looked eagerly forward to it every Sunday evening and later Tuesdays.

"" That ability right there is a testament to Henson, and how appealing the Muppet characters were even to adults.

Throughout this film, you might think this film is just for kids. Cameos include Liza Minneli ( "" a frog? "" ), Elliot Gould ( as the cop ), Brooke Shields ( propositioned by a rat ), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers.",1
Amazing film! FRIENDSHIP!,1
round. I am also curious of the rifle itself. Any information would be great.,1
"9 / 10. I know I know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome. A nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. Post - script : The scenes with Leia in the slave bikini are memorable. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master.",1
This was another great Tom Berenger movie..,1
I don't! The movie was a direct hit. And how. Who needs a bureaucrat? This is one military drama I like a lot!,1
"Great movie, even for a girl.",1
"No matter what, you know that he's got your back. < br / > < br / > It's worth checking out.",1
"If you've ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern war, take a look at this one.",1
"he doesn't do much better here, but Berenger makes the movie worthwhile.",1
"< br / > < br / > Sniper isn't a good action movie but a good psychological one. However, I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one. However, after Beccket showed his day dream of Montana, we can clearly see his softness inside.",1
"two big thumbs up! Pretty close to the real thing. "" Must see for sniper fans. But this isn't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults.",1
But this film is far better than his Stallone / Stone travesty The Specialist. As for Berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget Hollywood venture.,1
"And yes, the movie has many flaws, but what movie doesn't? Judge Sniper for yourself!! < br / > < br / > And yes, the Sniper Motto is ` one shot, one kill '.",1
"Billy Zane playing Miller does what he can with a role that doesn't afford him any glory until crucial end. What looks good in theory, is irrelevant in the jungle. < br / > < br / > Peruvian director Luis Llosa takes us along to watch this thriller set in Panama. The only problem, Miller, has no experience in what he has been entrusted to achieve.",1
"< br / > < br / > We see earlier in the movie Sgt. Beckett with the help of his spotter Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, does his job. For it shows step by step how Sgt. < br / > < br / > The story of the film "" Sniper "" is focused on Sgt.",1
"This isn't the prototypical action movie, thank God. I don't think they were watching the right movie.",1
"Firstly, this is simply the funniest movie I have ever seen. But it goes deeper than that.",1
"Meloni has such charm in this part. I became such a fan girl all over again. But it was all Chris'film. It's easy to pigeon hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler ( LOSVU ). I haven't seen Busfield since 30something, and he was fun to watch.",1
Who knew they could be so funny?? < br / > < br / >,1
!,1
5 out 10 Stars. I mean really.,1
"Of course, I loved the music, the special effects, the two droids, but this has been overly debated elsewhere. Oh, boy! De mon âme à ton âme "", ( from my soul to yours ), as would write Bejard to the late Zen master T. Deshimaru. And when he grabs and betrays his Master to save Luke, thereby risking his own life! The lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his Black helmet.",1
The most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again.,1
"One of Hung's better early efforts. Highly recommended for a good mood. "" Sammo turns on his dead - on Bruce Lee impersonation when fighting!",1
"ie., e. g., esp. This is a comedy about kung fu. Jour de fête ), he is certainly on the same wave length. Some have told me that they loathe his work.",1
"Oh, the fighting. This is of of Sammo's great early comedy films.",1
It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. 8. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. Sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs.,1
"The sets are cheesy, inside and out. Who would want it any other way? That's no problem here. Not a single shot of a city or even a fake skyline. A big, blustering, blubbering baby, he seems constantly drunk. The result is a claustrophobic set of scenes.",1
Gypo Nolan becomes haunted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel just like a Judas.,1
"With such performances are Oscars won. < br / > < br / > This is not to say the Informer is truly a throwback to the golden days of the silents. If he thought a story was silly, he just did it half - arsed. In the mid - 1930s Hollywood was regaining its confidence after the difficulties of the talkie transition.",1
"Like many people here, I started out finding my patience being tried by this film. By the end, I actually shed a few tears. You see, to earlier audiences, what are to us the "" slow parts "" were the main body of the story. But that isn't quite accurate. Think about it for a minute or two. It's the inflation problem of modern movies. They watched and found anecdotal and thematic interest there.",1
John Ford : already a film giant 1935! Max Steiner's score is unforgettable.,1
It's not a'good'movie - it's fantastic!,1
"Until like in the case of bull - like Gypo Noland, Victor Mclaglen, it's too much too late. Thats enough money for both him and Kaite to travel to America.",1
Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the finest in film history.,1
"< br / > < br / > Meanwhile, Gypo is plagued with guilt for his friend's untimely death, and descends into a bout of heavy - drinking that rivals Don Birnam in'The Lost Weekend ( 1945 )'in its excessiveness. However, it's obvious that these people feel no affection for the man, and are simple showing him attention to exploit him for money. As Gypo drowns his sorrows in copious volumes of alcohol, trapped in a vicious little circle of depression, his extravagant spending captures the attention of the investigating IRA members. Yet again, early morning television proves an invaluable resource for films that I otherwise would never have been able to track down.",1
And the Oscar winning performance by Victor McLaglen as the drunken Gypo is simply unbelievable.,1
< br / > < br / > Times are tough on many in Ireland and the burnt out Gypo Nolan is caught in a web of poverty and desperation - and the walls are closing in. < br / > < br / > Victor McLaglen portrays the fallen Gypo Nolan and definitely deserved the Best Actor Oscar he was awarded for this film.,1
"Anyway, the sudden turn at the end brought tears to my eyes. < br / > < br / > Ford, as usual, packs a lot into a little bit of film. < br / > < br / > In "" The Quiet Man, "" of course, McLaglen is a country squire at odds with the local IRA.",1
One of John Ford's best films'The Informer'doesn't feature any grand scenery of the American West. < br / > < br / > It is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple Gypo that is the film's most impressive achievement.,1
"or perhaps "" Why? """,1
"The same is true for The Informer, which is on occasion very dreadful indeed, and yet it boasts splendid photography, some fine acting, a wonderful score and a good, decent simple story. Yet people do behave that way, they do say things like that. It's also a classic, if a tarnished one. Now go watch movie. And in what way?",1
"After seeing this film, he obviously could do a heck of a lot more. < br / > < br / > See the film to find out the gritty details. One is the previous, the other a WANTED sign. See it also for McLaglen and Ford's patriotic portrayal of the IRA. He shoves a lot. He should, however, know whether or not to cross IRA. I make Westerns. "" < br / > < br / > John Ford once famously said, "" My name is Ford. Should he do it and get the money to go?",1
its best.,1
"He also picks up a hanger - on played by J. M. Kerrigan. He hasn't the wit to really cover his own tracks. His real name before having it anglicized was Sean O'Fiernan. No split involved in his award. Of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows, making it possibly first noir thriller. < br / > < br / > John Ford knew this world very well.",1
Highly recommended.,1
It deserves a 12. < br / > < br / > Rating : 10.,1
This is one of Hollywood's Classic. The lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death. McLaglen plays an IRA rouge who betrays his leader to collect a reward during Ireland's Sinn Fein Rebellion. Max Steiner's dramatic music score adds to cinematic delight.,1
"It's easily one of John Ford's most emotionally involving films. I love the darker side of Ford. 10 / 10. What Gypo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand his motives. The acting is remarkable. Gypo Nolan ( Victor McLaglen ) is as poor as anyone on Earth. Meanwhile, the other Irish rebels are searching for the informer.",1
The new actor Aryan gave a good performance. What a false world this is. < br / > < br / > A great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi. Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone. It got me thinking.,1
Once by mistake he kills Shekhar ( Akshay Kumar ). He has a family in India. He kidnaps Viren Sahay's family for the same reason. Kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague.,1
"The songs are catchy. A lavish production, I must add. It emphasizes on the idea of karma. It isn't for eyes of children.",1
"It is an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. It gives a powerful message of family. Don't read reviews by critic, they're just ignorant.",1
"< br / > < br / > Better then Khakee i thought and i thought Khakkee too was good movie. This was a excellent movie. Not many reviews, hence thought i would add one.",1
< br / > < br / > Return of the Jedi is my favorite of the Original Trilogy. Leia is still cool in this film as well as Han and Lando.,1
"To me, Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies. He was a die - hard villain, a no - apologies villain. There I think maybe the director could have done better. But, to be honest, the very best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel.",1
!,1
"But, overall - - buy this movie. < br / > < br / > Drawbacks?",1
"The representation of hobbits, dwarves etc have had the'disney'treatment. I only wish he ( Bakshi ) had been given the money to complete his epic. !",1
That would've made it the ultimate movie. I give it a 7. Too bad it wasn't one great animation film. It's definitely not for children.,1
in my opinion i thought it was EXTREMELY long. i will see new one and i hope it is better!,1
"BUT, the 2001 live action version is the new hallmark of The Lord of the Rings! < br / > < br / > Overall, not AS bad as many say it is. For diehard fans of the books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings. At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously!",1
Those who hate it and curse Ralph Bakshis name and those love it and call it work of genious. There seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net. I'm inclined to be in the middle.,1
"I would also agree that the Balrog is unsatisfactory, due partly to bad animation, and that Gandalf windmills his arms too much. < br / > < br / > I have to confess to a certain bias here. Finally getting my hands this week on a VHS copy that was being thrown away ( and isn't that just par for the course..? )",1
"< br / > < br / > The voice acting was generally of high quality. Particularly strange was decision to frequently have Saruman referred to as "" Aruman "".",1
6 - The Dark side seduction scene. 5 - The Last Battle. 9 out 10.,1
"Regardless, this is an epic and wonderfully animated film. The film also boasts a grand music score by Leonard Rosenman that fits every scene. This is an underrated adaption of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given.",1
"Take Aragorn for example. And those are stylish slow motion kills. The whole cast is too run of the mill. "" < br / > < br / > And then there is Gandalf. In this Bakshi version Gandalf ( William Squire ) is a real wizard. Yes a sword.",1
The quality of animation leaves room for complaint. It captured my imagination.,1
"Actually, it really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.",1
"This ADAPTATION wonderfully synthesizes Tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture.",1
"Speaking as a purist, this is a finer homage to Tolkien than the updated version. This is one of the most atmospheric portions of the film and chills me whenever I see it. You wonder why fate chose this limp biscuit to carry the one ring to the Cracks of Doom. Bakshi sustains Frodo's character as Tolkien conceived it. We see his decline as weight of his burden increases.",1
This is a very beautiful film. Peter Jackson's film wasn't a perfect rendition either. Well guess what?,1
"This is not a garden variety Disney But there is some level of interest always with the characters, and here there's a more old - fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more. And with Bakshi's version, it's almost not fair in a way, as what we do see is really not the complete vision, not what Jackson really had ( probably final cut ). The actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes, are more or less adequate for the parts, with a few parts standing out ( John Hurt as Aragorn and William Squire as Gandalf ).",1
"If only John Hurt weren't too old to play Aragorn ; I love his voice. In books you have room to include the references to the larger world of the Elves and Middle - Earth's vast history. In film, you trade that for visuals and sound that convey same elements in a different way.",1
"So, in some respects, I owe this film a degree of acknowledgement as the film which shaped my literary tastes forever. but instead of destroying it he foolishly chooses to keep it. Following a great battle during which Sauron is defeated, the ring falls into possession of a king named Isildur.",1
The Emperor is somewhat an original character. The next best scene is when Luke rushes to strike back Darth Vader to protect Leia. A very good movie.,1
Jenny Hanahan I really enjoyed the reunion a lot!,1
"He does not receive 1 / 100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience. There are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3 / 4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film, but there are very few changes to the storyline. < br / > < br / > What Mr. Bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films. Something so fresh, and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as "" The Lord of the Rings "". This film, in my opinion, is, despite it's flaws ( which I maintain are * few * ), an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art. No, this is not Disney animation. Where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which Bakshi has created. < br / > < br / > Peter S. Beagle's screenplay ( based very little, as I understand it, on an early draft by Chris Conkling ) is a very loyal adaptation of Tolkien's works. No it's not live action. But I feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm.",1
"What shall it be? Undoubtedly it was Wells that planted the seed. One case in point is the two pilots from opposing sides discussing the nature of war "" Why must we murder one another. Wells was profound and brought subtext to his tales. "". The dialouge is often laden, heavy handed and unconvincing.",1
"Unlike Metropolis, however, it might not bear repeated viewings. < br / > < br / > Raymond Massey and some of his co - stars play multiple roles in this film, to good effect. Ultimately, the storyline covers 100 years. Maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci - fi innovation : a sequel? But that's a big problem with this film - - there really isn't a cohesive storyline. Things to Come is an historic film.",1
"it was and remains far ahead of its time. 'Yet we may have all the Universe, or nothing. that swiftly brings tears to any parent / grandparent. he sweeps his hand over the night sky.",1
"I think I understood only 80 % of the dialog. This is an amazing movie from 1936. It could use closed - captioning. < br / > < br / > Unless you have great listening abilities, this movie is hard to listen to. However, when it gets to the future, it's just plain fun to watch.",1
SYNOPSIS The future as seen from 1939 England. This film was cutting edge for its day. This vision of the future is both terrifying and whimsical. < br / > < br / > The ending of film leaves the viewer a bit perplexed. This is a fascinating work on numerous levels. The special effects are very good as is the story line. Thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow.,1
"How would we react? < br / > < br / > As far as qualifying as sci - fi, one of the biggest common demoninators of that genre is it's speculative nature.",1
"Lastly, it's a really good story. Very unusual scenics, especially the modern ones. The realization of the modern machinery is very effective.",1
It gave details of why some things happened. Swept flying wing planes. Strong rolls for the women through the entire movie.,1
h. g. wells like Jules Verne had a vision for future with his stories. 10 out of 10 a classic science fiction movie.,1

"However, there are some profound words there. The film is a visual feast, if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as inventive. These films are the products of artisans, not industrialists. They are operatic in scope, and visually inspiring.",1
Inspiring like that final monologue by John Cabal. < br / > < br / > 9 1 / 2 out of 10.,1
"I'm sure glad that war didn't turn out as it did in the movie. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both great actors, come off as quite a pair of fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as the "" The Boss "" a megalomaniac warlord.",1
"It's the main weakness with the film, it's devoted to Wells's philosophy of science will solve all problems and the rest of us are backward fools. < br / > < br / > Massey's characters, two generations of the same family holds that supremely optimistic view. < br / > < br / > Wells got it wrong both in time and in development. Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptic who feels man is rushing too far forward. In Wells's lifetime scientists certainly fled the rightwing fascistic governments of Hitler and Mussolini. He apparently never envisioned the computer as well as atomic power. Scientists as a group are far too above world of politics to engage in such things.",1
"It also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress. It has a beautiful Menzies art design, but mediocre special effects ( esp. the toy tanks ).",1
That was more than ten years before. Amazing. That was not Hitler. The last The weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite. That was H. G. Wells and that was not after the first world war. Wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by 2036.,1
"( "" no private airplanes "". The very best acting performance is that of Ralph Richardson as the Boss.",1
"< br / > < br / > This movie is good on TV but it was made for the big screen, so if you have an opportunity to see it in some cinema. please do, it's overwhelming.",1
'Watch it and marve.,1
When I think of Return of the Jedi I think epic. Yeah Ewoks were in there so what? The best part was of course the special effects.,1
You can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts. < br / > < br / > Things to Come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once.,1
"< br / > < br / > "" Things to Come "" is one of those rarities in film, a picture that makes you think. If he fails, others will follow. Those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control.",1
I was enthralled and entertained.,1
"Who? That audience and myself were effected by this film! I recognized images from many other films, that have paid homage to this classic. < br / > < br / > That imagery is very effecting.",1
"Sure, you could sit back and knock the film because, by today's standards, the effects are only so - so. If this is available on a DVD, hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning. First, it is extremely original in both style and content. All three times the sound and print quality stank - - particularly the sound. As the sound on the video kept cutting out, I really would have appreciated this! Aside from the great movie METROPOLIS, this is about the oldest pure sci - fi movie. How true!",1
"I hope a good DVD exists of entire film. The first part of the film, when war comes to Everytown, is short but powerful. The Everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design. Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the Chief's mistress. Wells'prediction was borne out all too soon. ) The explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of German Expressionist graphic design. Things to Come is that rarity of rarities, a film about ideas.",1
"Lasting nearly 30 years, mind!? The grander conceptions have something to them ; a war in 1940, well that was perhaps predictable... The film hasn't got much interest in subtle complexities ; it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle, blunt moralism, every time. It's not a great role, yet Richardson makes a lot of it.",1
"Mans desire for war, mans inhumanity to man. However, much was right. I first saw this as a child living in East London.",1
"The son of Passworthy and Cabell's daughter, are the astronauts being sent. The structure is that after a contrasted - pair of episodes of normalcy and gathering clouds of war, the script allows the war to happen. This early sci - fi masterwork by Herbert George Wells with music by Arthur Bliss is a powerful piece of film - making. Only the Boss dies, fighting too hard against pacifying. In section three, a future Cabell argues with a future Passworthy over the morality of human science. The survivors are subject to a plague called "" The Wandering Sickness "" also. The film then shows ore being mined and by slow steps being made into the girders of a magnificent new futuristic city of towers. - - everlastingly ; this is Wells'comment on war versus progress.",1
How he missed out on an Oscar is a mystery. ) Return of the Jedi is a fitting end to a Saga that will stand the test of time. How we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow? Vadar it seemed had won day. desperate to turn Luke to the Dark Side even if it means betraying his apprentice Darth Vadar.

"Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be good ( WARNING! ) some time ago. I first saw this movie on some movie channel ( HBO? ) and I was right.",1
It is now one of my favorite movies of all time.,1
I was blown away. I was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great.,1
I cannot stop saying how much I loved this movie. What really makes this movie so good is how true to some of the rap groups of the time this movie is. In the movie he plays rapper Ice Cold. Rusty Condieff has made an excellent film.,1
This movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit. Yet it's hilarious. The characters are all very funny and believable.,1
"But, if you know 80'/ 90's rap, you know how much of this stuff is true. As Spinal Tap is to heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet is to Rap. And the songs are off the hook also.",1
And oh no! This movie is good fun!,1
"My, Kasi Lemmings certainly is a fair looking woman. We follow the three members of the NWH as they embark upon their picaresque journey of would - be riches and fame.",1
The songs are too funny to be believed. The cast is talented and does at great job becoming the characters portrayed.,1
"not to mention "" love song "" tasty was hooking up.",1
"Great video, superb!",1
"Sometimes, the jokes just kinda flow. So I filed it away that I should see this movie.",1
"Just not Carpenters, they're sacred. I got most of the jokes ( at least I think I did ). ( If only we could say the same about bagpipe music. )",1
"Rated R for Strong Language, Violent Content and Some Nudity. Its shame this film is not in the Top 250.",1
"Yes, a bit.",1
Okay. Also Recommended : Psycho III,1
"The first 2 films have that dirty, lived - in look with all the technology and so forth. Also the creatures were excessively muppet - like and cutesy. However it emerges at the end of the day a winner, despite all its flaws. This makes for a much less textured film. The It just feels like lazy construction.",1
"The Re - Animator sequels aren't as great as the original, but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned. The plot follows perfectionist dentist Dr Feinstone. However, credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme. I should thank Brian Yuzna for casting Ken Foree in the movie. Dentistry doesn't frighten me, but surprisingly ; I would appear to be in the minority.",1
"That's why it has it's R18 rating. When I saw the Dentist, I thought it was very cool. Overall awesome flick, but not for everyone.",1
"< br / > < br / > HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! The Dentist "" is a solid film!",1
Alan Howarth's spirited shuddery score also hits flesh - crawling spot. An enjoyably warped treat.,1
I give it an 8.,1
< br / > < br / > The plot is twisted. Corbin Bernsen really suprised me. And you don't want to come to his path. Cast was great. He goes nutso and starts to take care of people teeth in the nasty way.,1
Especially from Corbin Bernson.,1
"Alan starts to lose his mind, he convinces himself that everything is decayed & rotten, just like his patient's teeth, & it's up to him to fix it. The Dentist starts on the morning of Dr. Alan Feinstone ( Corbin Bernsen ) & his wife Brooke's ( Linda Hoffman ) wedding anniversary.",1
"Nice legs, too! This is a gory mess and pretty convincing.",1
"star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes, good vs evil. it's an idea. Star Wars is more than a movie.",1
and snaps big time into a furious breakdown. Check it out!,1
Corbin makes a great creepy dentist. It does to dentists what Jaws does to sharks... ish. < br / > < br / > end.,1
"Most importantly, it's exclusively for horror fans. I won't spoil what happens. The Dentist "" turned that around. Second, when the gore does come, it hits all the worst, squirmy nerves. And the tension drops a little bit during the very end.",1
"It's a typical Brian Yuzna situation, not well written but there's gore. It's one of man's primal fears.",1
"And I have always had a love for medical horror. I love this movie. Sure, it is mild now, but back in the day, it was awesome.",1
"For that, I take 3 stars off! The movie is kind of boring.",1
The rest of cast does good work too. The Dentist is a really good thriller. You can take that as a recommendation to itself. And pretty disturbing. This film came right on time actually. That's what the story is all about.,1
"And nobody ( except for Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors ) likes going to the dentist. I'm surprised no - one has thought of doing a movie like this before. Also featured playing a cop, is the ever welcome Ken Foree. Horror is often most effective when it uses real life unpleasantness as a theme. < br / > < br / > The sequel The Dentist 2 is also worth watching, but slightly under par compared to the original.",1
"). < br / > < br / > Corbin Bernsen, in a nicely nuanced performance, is Alan Feinstone, dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the tracks early on. < br / > < br / > Director Brian Yuzna clearly has great fun with the script. The makeup effects are for the most part quite good.",1
Meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown! < br / > < br / > For me the pacing of movie was just right. The rest is left to our very fertile imaginations! All the victims fall into the dentist's trap in very calculated ways.,1
"First off, WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died??? Sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies.",1
how scary is that.,1
"Highly recommended. """,1
"We witness how he goes from respected professional to psycho murder in a day. While his part is quite small, he makes a great job with it. < br / > < br / > Most of the success of the premise is in Bernsen's performance as Feinstone. The rest of the cast is not as good, and I think that their sub par acting hurts film more than it should.",1
"Feinstone sees his second patient, beauty queen April Reign. He encourages Brooke to try out the room's dental chair. He reveals his new Italian opera - themed patient room. April starts to cough and half - wakes up from the gas. Later that night, Brooke meets Feinstone at his practice. Feinstone begins to clean Jody's teeth.",1
"Had The Dentist'not been intended to be a fun, almost comical, horror movie, Bernsen's performance would probably have been much more powerful. < br / > < br / > Corbin Bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic, deranged and perfectionist Dr. Alan Feinstone. Those who became annoyed at the number of Scream'( 1996 ) clones from the late Nineties may",1
"but I thought that was really sweet. He is so cute, isn't he? !",1
hmmm?,1
Needless to say it was a good solid Doctor Who story. Might be a tad too intense for younger viewers though.,1
"But who care about what Yanks say, we rock! < br / > < br / > 10 out of 10 I hope many old fans will one day soon say "" The old Doctor Who has returned "".",1
"An Epic end to a Classic Saga, and it's only just of the pace of the first two. Han, Leia and Chewy battle it out on Endor, desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the Death Star.",1

"Later on, he threatens to step on a punk kid ( who'd MAKE my day. Her sister, tho, is almost comatose as a result of the trauma, so the memory is never far from her mind. ""? Sandra Locke is as cold in this film as she is beautiful. After executing her first perp, Jennifer curiously watches Det. Ya gotta love this spunky lady.",1
It's also a kickass action movie.,1
Excellent entertainment.,1
4-May,1
"This film was released in the early ` 80s, the time of Regan and the young republicans. However, the film still lacks impact and believability.",1
Not a classic movie but better than the others except for the original Dirty Harry. ). Anyway..... an action - packed story set again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz.,1
"Sudden Impact has what original Dirty Harry had, a dark tone with entertaining value. Ten years after, she's out for revenge by gunning down her attackers. < br / > < br / > So do you feel lucky, punk?",1
"Luke, Lando, Leia, Chewie, and the droids all travel to Tatooine to rescue the frozen Han Solo from the crime Lord ; Jabba The Hutt. The film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years. Filled with powerful action, as the climax of the original trilogy, George Lucas gives us a rousing finish of the "" Star Wars "" saga in "" Jedi "". The rebel heroes regroup with the Rebel Fleet. In emotionally charged sequences Luke must face his father as the Emperor lures out his dark emotions. Despite the feelings of most "" Star Wars "" fans, in my opinion "" Return Of The Jedi "" is the greatest cinematic film ever created.",1
I watched the McCoys reunion and was glad to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez!! ! I have searched everywere no luck. I know that Walter Brennan had died. The only thing I could find out about Michael Winkelman is he was supposed to be born in 1946. The shows today dont have that.,1
"Also, there are too many people far dirtier than Dirty harry. The movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot.",1
"Eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. For me, at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Also, I think this is first well paced film Eastwood directed. In some places it actually owes more to Death Wish than the original Dirty Harry film. Forget the "" Go ahead punk, make my day scene "", that's iconic but not original.",1
"Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge. The pace is quick and several of the scenes are unforgettable. "" This was without a doubt the best of the "" Dirty Harry "" series. Go ahead - Make my day... You feel lucky, Punk?.... """,1
"< br / > < br / > "" Sudden Impact "" offers relentless action from beginning to end. know more than they are telling. This incident is shown in a very disturbing flashback,nippets of which recur before each new murder.",1
"Jack Thibeau was well cast as Kruger, a pervert. Albert Popwell was excellent as Horace, Harry's buddy. Now for really bad part. And Paul Drake was just horrible as Mick.",1
Harry Callahan himself is dirtier than ever. The film is extremely gritty and graphically violent. Not afraid to make use of his 44. SPOILERS ahead!,1
This is Harry Callahan Trouble follows him. Go Ahead Make your day. Now the second part of the story.,1
"Granted she is not to bad here, but her character could have been so much better by someone else. Just think "" Magnum Force "" with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot. She brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me. Still, very nice entry into the Dirty Harry series of movies.",1
"A major plus with these films are the dialogues, while I wouldn't call A bulldog named meathead that pisses and farts. Mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor. Oh yeah. It's a striking sight that builds fear! There he begins to dig up dirt, which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge.",1
"On the contrary. Mark Hamill However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.",1
"This "" incompatibility "" is the underlying theme of the series. ). - ( do they outweigh those of the criminal?",1
This was the only sequel in the dirty Harry saga that equaled first. There weren't too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot. < br / > < br / > The performances across the board were compelling.,1
"However, the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. Refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of San Francisco.",1
"This whole main plot isn't very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines, which just adds to the frustration. He's told to'take a vacation ', and that's the last thing on his mind. and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus.",1
What we have here is an action movie with a point of view.,1
"Although some say that The Enforcer is the best out of the series, I completely disagree. In Diry Harry it's "".. Well do ya, punk? "" In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worthy of being in the series. ; in Magnum Force "" A man's got to know his limitations "" ; and in this it's "" Go ahead. Make my day. """,1
"Callahan, looking fragile sometimes and out of place, his demeanor still was unwavering.",1
"The Enforcer "" should never have been made. Maybe he's been gone for too long this time. 2 out of 10 Sudden Impact "" is a true Dirty Harry sequel. """,1
"The Special Edition for "" Return of the Jedi "" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war.",1
Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie.,1
This doesn't mean that it's quality is any less. Harry's always on the job it seems.,1
So he does ; as only ` Dirty Harry'can.,1
I had never seen a film like this before.,1
Highly suspenseful.,1
"The suspense was flawless, and maintained throughout until the end. harry carasso, Paris, France",1
He will be missed. A decent telefilm to help send Paul Winfield off to celluloid heaven. What an actor.,1
A gem!,1
"! It is clever, well paced and very well acted.",1
"Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinée style. As far as I'm concerned, it is still a grandiosely entertaining film. In fact, I think it is the third best film in the 6 - part saga. Also, it is a lot of fun. C3PO and R2D2 provide ( as usual ) great comic relief.",1
One of the smartest Greek series ever! We'll never forget Eglimata or any of casting crew! Actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space in Greek audience's heart.,1
"again! Our Heroes are two married couples, their relatives, their friends and neighbors. = Eglimata!!!",1
"Surely a serial you will never stop enjoying! Along with "" Aparadektoi, the best Greek Comedy series ever!",1
Rated R for zombie related violence I rate this 8 / 10. And we find the loving Fido whatever he may do.,1
"Fido has structure, a script that tells a story, and acting that is superior. MERK Make no mistake, this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed. "" Highly recommended.",1
Who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community?,1
"So, to keep up, the Robinsons obtain zombie Billy Connolly ( as Fido ).",1
"For the life of me, why did this film receive an R rating?! Mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombie'friend. < br / > < br / > The story is set in a parallel - type world. Funny, irreverent and unique - - this film needs to be seen by a much wider audience.",1
The extras were cool too. I. e. The Nutty Professor.,1
"Unfortunately, the Robinson family has no zombies whatsoever, due to their patriarch, Bill's, fear of the reanimated dead. At the end of the film, it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour. "" movie.",1
It was nice to see.,1
Definitely check this one out if you get the chance. The kids were also great. I was also on hand for the premiere in Toronto.,1
"< br / > < br / > Seeking to keep up with the Joneses, mom ( Carry - Anne Moss ) has acquired a zombie. His mom is would - be social climber, and his dad is nervy and detached. Fidois a very odd film. < br / > < br / > Fido has little of Shaun's carnage, gore & belly laughs. < br / > < br / > The film looks gorgeous, and is wonderfully performed by all involved.",1
Oh well. It deserved more recognition. It's an instant classic nonetheless.,1
"< br / > < br / > Timmy runs into a spot of bother, however, when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. ).",1
< br / > < br / > Cast is superb. A nice touch. He's a genuine screen presence. Loved it! A true reality show. What's not to like?,1
Zombie girlfriends?,1
"Timmy "" kills "" the zombified neighbor. Their son, Timmy, befriends the zombie, naming him "" Fido "". But it's a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie.",1
"It's a re - animated dead guy... a zombie. Well, actually, it kind of is. Which can be a problem especially with the elderly. After that, that's when I knew I had to see it. Then get lost. And I am so glad I did. No? FIDO is about a little boy named Timmy and his new pet Fido.",1
Who would have thought? < br / > < br / > Wrong! It's amazing.,1
Finally a well done twist of zombies and comedy. Billy Connelly flexes his acting muscle. My goodness.,1
He really brings the changes Luke has gone through seem real. Harrison Ford is still good. Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this movie in perspective.,1
"The melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off. So, for some people, this will really work. Timmy was named that for a reason! This film takes place in the 1950s. Every single of the famous Lassie episodes are spun here. Even Connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job. I give it an 8.",1
Why did the people love it? And this somebody is me. That is why I rated it so high. A satire to be precise.,1
"This is a clever premise. However, Fido itself is a very good movie. That's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie! Billy Connolly was inspired casting.",1
"Go and see this movie! In fact whole cast is perfect. She's sweet, funny and sexy!",1
"< br / > < br / > Zombies are featured prominently among the characters. But intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among hardest won achievements in movie - making. It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual Bizarro Award. For me anyway, "" Fido "" is a hoot!",1
"< br / > < br / > While the cast is generally good, I felt that Moss and Nelson stood out.",1
! < br / > < br / > Loved it!!,1
"But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian Director and it's a Comedy! And, YES, I actually think it is better than'Shawn of the Dead '. I urge you to go see this little Canuck gem. I'll certainly be buying the DVD once it emerges hopefully by next Summer. Just saw the World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and thoroughly enjoyed it.",1
"The charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. Now, given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, I realise this is a rather big claim. At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing I'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with'Shaun of the Dead '. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well - adjusted, useful members of the community.",1
"How about Lassie? Quite frankly, I'm just happy Fido got picked up for US distribution. A pet? Unspeakable acts? If you like ( or at least tolerate ) zombies, small children, and loads of deadpan satire, Fido's the film for you. In any case... < br / > < br / > Ever seen Shaun of the Dead? Good.",1
"< br / > < br / > I can't review "" Star Wars "" as a movie. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....",1
"Smetimes, that's what movie needs to be. A simple story is it not? A group of miners at the border try to cross over to France to get work.",1
"But when a fire begins on the French side, the common decency of the German men lead to assistance, safety and even friendship.",1
Valliant effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to pronounce this director's distaste for war.,1
"THEY mentality. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco - German border. Considering history, though, the film's impact was minimal at best.",1
"A deadly accident brings out very best in everyone, nullifying any superiors'orders.",1
"If you are a real film buff, this is a film you will not want to miss. There is an old old retired miner who manges to go down mine by ladder when the elevator breaks down.",1
"Talk about over - rated! And, in a supporting role is Jack Pickford - - always remembered as the brother of Mary. Well made, but certainly NOT original! However, it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing.",1
"How had I not heard of this film before this website? Well, you can't always trust the ratings. 2!",1
"The best climax is when Luke shouts "" NOOO! "" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle. The end could not be better. ). He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable. They all do so well. What an amazing man! Harrison Ford - need I say more? They are believable characters. and then watch the original trilogy yet again. Yubb Nubb!",1
"Wonderful silent classic - a great example of Twenties commercial cinema with edge. This is an extraordinary film, that tricks you constantly. William Haines is absolutely delightful - he is certainly a star that deserves to be re - discovered.",1
No one worked this formula like Haines. He was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time. Haines was a top - five box office star starting with this picture through 1932.,1
"On that level, it's pretty damn good. I'm giving it a 7. First off it's NOT a horror film. I disagree. ; pretty good acting by Sullivan ( only 10 at the time! )",1
Fessenden successfully continues George Romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out. If you want Scream or anything like the big - studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother. This well - written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say.,1
It's worth it. This movie is excellent. I found it very interesting. Two Thumbs Way Up!,1
"The acting is good, the characters act like a normal family. Check this out.",1
Is it real? It's one to rejoice in.,1

Only he can answer that question. Lucas'CGI enhancements Perspective is a good thing.,1

"Thus the many flashes of the creature standing still, and the obvious sped - up footage of it running. However, as a monster character it never really comes to life. I stress that these reports are uncomfirmed.",1
A solid B movie.,1
"Also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods, as it is established early on in the film, that the family is from the city. Not because that's what Wendigo actually is, but because that is how he understands it.",1
"In particular, deranged hunter Otis takes it personally. On the way up, George hits a stag with his car. He follows the family to their vacation home, making sure they see him. He spies on George and Kim as they have sex. Miles takes figure home with him, already haunted by the death of the deer the day before. A Native American man tells Miles that this is the Wendigo, a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry.",1
"This is also a story of alienation. < br / > < br / > The film is well paced and acted. Erik Per Sullivan, as Miles, conveys the inner turmoil within him.",1
"I usually prefer some ambiguity. Much of the film, and maybe all of it, is not really about the titular creature. Are there wendigos in the woods? Is Otis a psycho out to get our heroes? Heck, writer / director Larry Fessenden even has a character, George, reciting Robert Frost.",1
"But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films! < br / > < br / > All in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story. < br / > < br / > - The Speeder Bike Chase : Alright, so this was a special effects moment.",1
His star just gets brighter brighter. The suspense was palpable throughout. He wrote and starred in this terrific mystery. No one could have done it better.,1
"Even his singing was a delight. I am hoping A & E will continue this series. To me, that always distracts. Both Perry and "" Cash "" kept me guessing right up to the end.",1
"It's not Shakespeare. ). However, those who enjoyed ` Drive ', ( and I thought it was wonderful!",1
Then Watch this.,1
I hope so! This film is about the battle of one's sprit.,1
I have seen this movie quite a few times. But no paradise would be complete without its snake.,1
A classy film pulled in 2 directions. Anyone seeing this should pay attention to Susan Lucci.,1
"I am not sure whether the author intended to give this interpretation to the story, but I believe it fits perfectly. < br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) : "" Convite Para o Inferno "" ( "" Invitation to Hell "" ) My vote is seven.",1
The movie was keep you guessing as which direction it's going.,1
"Very curious why they were not even mentioned? It is my understanding that Little Luke had passed away in 1999, but I'm not sure how. All in all, Reunion Show was a real treat for me.",1
"Some of Busey's best work by far, rent or buy it today "" butthorn! "" That line resonates so well, it even tops Clooney's infamous "" hi Freeze, I'm Batman "" line. I coughed up some of my egg nog laughing so hard. My vote is a perfect 10 ( on the poo meter that is ).",1

McBain is then recruited by the Army for a rescue mission. < br / > < br / > T. L. Lankford and B. J. Goldman supply script, based on a story by Lankford and veteran B director Fred Olen Ray.",1
"This question is asked, of course, like in any film centering on CIA... but without getting preachy. Guns blasting, buildings exploding, cars crashing, and that's just the first ten minutes. < br / > < br / > But does America deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys?",1
HoW???? There is not one redeeming feature to this film.,1
I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. First of all I was not aware of Lucille. He was a voyeur. Visually he did not remind me of Little Richard. Overall the movie was great.,1
She is truly amazing.,1
The man could sing the drawers off the ladies and defined rock and roll.,1
7 out of 10.,1
This is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time. Pierce Brosnan is outstanding in a very different role.,1
Fresh!,1
"This is not a biography or even a docudrama, but does have good writing, great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing Richard. He seemed tame, compared to what I remember of him at the time. Little Richard is always on Some of his energy, which he still has, does not come across full force. < br / > < br / > If they had gotten into "" Bronze Liberace "" as Richard use to refer to himself in interviews, then there's a story.",1
"Thanks. Black actors out there are just, if not more, successful as others.",1
The movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group.,1
"All in all, its worth a gander. The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape.",1
"I was still very young, and the movie made a big impression on me.",1
The first - rate acting helps out a lot.,1
An excellent movie. Tony King was very realistic in his role of Satin.,1
"27 years later, it is still an original inspiration for achieveing my goals that I have set to accomplish since that time! < br / > < br / > This movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating "" Dreamgirls "" on Broadway and Mariah Carey's "" Glitter, "" 25 years later. I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it.",1
Leaving theater I felt very fulfilled from the film and plan to see it again in wide release.,1
"Silk Hope gets three and a half stars ( out of five ) on the Corkymeter. Bosley would be proud. But when it comes down to it, there's no denying that this girl can act.",1
"That's what makes her a star, in part.",1
Enjoy yourself.,1
Hearty recommendations.,1
"I loved the idea of this film from the moment I first saw a trailer for it. < br / > < br / > The story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine's heart. The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better.",1

The end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout.,1
But his Albert Einstein happens to be genuinely sweet. Maybe nobody really has tried. They were connivers and gonifs. More like his Kotch than like Willie Clarke.,1
Kudos to the writers for handling this froth with wit and levity. Eight very solid points. I also thought that Keene Curtis was wonderful as Eisenhower.,1
Hilarity ensues. Not to be missed.,1

I also love music.,1
"If you ask me, James ( Stephen Fry ) really was a dull guy. Anyway, everyone involved in this film did an absolutely outstanding job.",1
I really enjoyed them. It also shows his range and depth as an actor. I like the different approaches this movie takes.,1
"One of the best of the comedy romance genre. If you suspend all logic, you can almost imagine this silly story happening! The real Einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one ( outrageous ) step further. You cannot go wrong with Meg Ryan's cute perkiness combined with Albert Einstein's genius. With his three professorial buddies, Kurt, Nathan, and Boris, a lot of laughs ensue.",1

Nice film.,1
The cinematography is nice. I love sweet stories. You will laugh while watching this movie. People all ages should enjoy this movie.,1
It is so simple and sweet - definitely a chick flick romantic comedy. This is one of my all time favorites.,1

"This film touches'values ', it's a story about'what's right and wrong': morals.",1
A must - see for any Depardieu fan and by far his best early work.,1
Most people I talk to have never heard of it. A very racy film for the early'70s. I can remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978.,1
The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very enjoyable.,1

Real fun!,1
"Married amidst allied air raids, Maria and her new husband Herrmann are allowed a brief honeymoon before he's shipped out to the Russian front. In his absence, her despair is great : she spends most days at the train station, waiting for him to return.",1
A very intriguing film which is totally absorbing.,1
"To make ends meet, Maria starts working at a bar for mainly American soldiers and get to know a black soldier. There are food shortages. Herman admits to the murder, ends up in jail and Maria vows to wait for him. In her own words, she has become the "" Mata Hari of the economic miracle "". Right now, it's probably the correct way "". She decides to get involve with Karl, "" You're not having an affair with me ; I'm having an affair with you "".",1
"Maria will do whatever it takes to be successful, but she'll always be married.",1
Maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes Karl's mistress. Maria hears that her husband Hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with Bill. But one day while getting intimate with Bill they see Hermann at the door. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it.,1
"You might even say I'm an expert on it "". Sensual and tough Maria Braun.",1
Thank you guys for making a movie worth watching.,1
A realistic depiction of young love for the college set but also appealing to an older viewer like me. In the background are various friends acquaintances and situations that impact them for better or worse. Great movie. It has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two.,1
"< br / > < br / > Please visit www. It is a rare morality play full of food for thought. < br / > < br / > While I'm writing this, I might as well talk a bit more about Love Trap. lovetrapmovie. com for complete accurate info about this film.",1
"The ending is awesome because a storyline ( with a positive moral! ) emerges : this is a frenetic, frantic and fun movie, which does deserve a wide audience. Think Pierce Brosnan and you think suave, dapper, intelligent James Bond.",1
"BROADside? Get it? No, not funny. A few years ago I added a comment to the IMDB on "" The Real McCoys "" TV series. We never missed it.",1
I was pleasantly surprised. Check it out. I picked this film up at my local library. Good stuff!,1
"The story is poetic, substantive, and creative. The movie displayed what love really is, action not emotion. Love trap is a "" must see "" independent film. The entire presentation surpassed my expectations.",1
i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way! this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format. how i wish those days would come again.,1
"In short, it's great groovy retro - 70's fun!",1
I own it and enjoy it about once a year. truly great memories of young adolescence!,1
"... this is, above all else, the typical Crown International Pictures drive - in ( read "" passion pit "" ) programmer.",1
It wasn't me!,1
Were there more in the original?,1
Brilliant. Wasn't sure what to expect from this film.,1
Balduin is haunted by his double ( the intertitles express this beautifully as does the action. There are so many other things to say about this incredible film.,1
I was not disappointed. One thing I have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie.,1
"After all, the film's plot is a bit vague in spots and acting is, at times, a bit stilted.",1
"Fortunately, the story of this book with moving pictures is good. Furthermore, the remake has a reason for Lyduschka character, other than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate. Worse is the lack of editing ; there's very little scene dissection and scenes linger. ' Here, the obtrusively acted gypsy lurks around, seemingly, with a cloak of invisibility. < br / > < br / > Nevertheless, this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually.",1
"Classic movies like "" Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari. "" Scapinelli offers Balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room.",1
"Despite being made in 1928, with the makeup he doesn't look much younger than he did in many of his later films. < br / > < br / > Exactly what happens next I'll leave to you, but it's a pretty good film - - particularly at the end. By the way, look for William Powell as the Russian director.",1
William Powell is great as always. Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent. This is a movie that touches in many parts.,1
What an unexpected pleasure!,1
"Then, when Jannings arrives, everything settles down. It was written by Lajos Biro, who had been on the scene long enough to know. < br / > < br / > Taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among Hollywood's most celebrated immigrants Emil Jannings. 1927, and Hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade.",1
The movie flashes back to his days in Russia leading up to the country's fall to revolutionaries.,1
"Rating, 10. However, he is not any ordinary extra. All around brilliance.",1
"Its often very very funny, and its quite subversive and crazy. Its not a little show. South Park fans would surely get something here. We have nothing like that here, and this show suffers from it.",1
The guy who plays in that's my bush looks a lot like him! It is also a political satire.,1
"Boo, scary!",1
There is also a good emotional turn from Yuko Hamada as a wronged woman.,1
"At the same time, he meets another boss ( Shushui ) - - a sort of guru to the poor. The boss is quite charming and surprisingly Ichi is totally taken in by the evil man. This is a minor mistake, and only a crazed fan like myself would have noticed. Most films in the series take place over a few days or weeks. This could easily explain why this film seems so different in style to the previous 15 films.",1
If this had been done earlier in the Zatoichi series it could have been one of the best. This must be one of the best - sustained series in movie history.,1
"Danny Glover is also good in a not entirely sympathetic role as her partner, Boesman. This is definitely a film worth searching for.",1
"Haven't seen this film? Director John Berry wisely does not attempt to dress - up Athol Fugard's play. Hands down, the best film of the year 2000. Haven't even heard of this film? It wouldn't surprise me.",1
"Sad but poignant. And then, as I was watching it, I felt the misery of Lena and Boesman into my bones. I decided to wait until the next day.",1
"If that is so, this is the appropriate way to go out. This movie to me felt like closure.",1
"True to "" Homicide "" form, there were no happy endings, such is life.",1
I think it is time to increase that group to 2.,1
! Thanks NBC for giving us Finally we didn't get!,1
"For all the Homicide junkies out there, this movie was great! It helped to resolve some ( but not all ) issues from the series.",1
"After seeing it, I'm sure it had some effect on me through process. imdb. Of course Greg Kinnear is always great. < br / > < br / > http : / / www. I think this film is incredibly underrated!",1
This is the final episode we deserved. 'Is death justified by reasoning?'',1
Thanks to cast for some wonderful TV. My guess is Bayless of course. This is a series I wish had lived on.,1
I enjoyed this a lot. It hurt to see that this was the end of Homicide.,1
This is a good film. Gee runs for mayor and gets shot. Yes.,1
"< br / > < br / > It was almost as if the series with the full title of "" HOMICIDE : LIFE ON THE STREET "" ( 1993 - 99 ) was a sort of "" Mr. In - Between "" of series. Alive, but in a comatose state, he is taken to the Hospital. It was too big to just cancel, but too small to get a case of'Rabid Ratings Ravings'over. But'G'isn't ready to really retire - retire yet. There, I've said it Artistic, Artistic!! There is a great < br / > < br / > OUR STORY. So, instead of a rocking chair o a fishing rod, we find that Al is running for Mayor of'Charm City.",1
Loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season. And the movie certainly retained that spirit.,1
EVER!,1
"Story - wise, I found this film somewhat lacking. ). The movie brings out that sense of "" family "", not only amongst the characters, but amongst the actors, as well. Now, if they'd just release it on DVD... Having said that, "" Homicide : The Movie "" is still a great watch.",1
"< br / > < br / > Let me just say, I was not disappointed at all.",1
"All in all, a terrific TV movie.",1
Davis is fine as Kinnear's flirtatious wife. A chance encounter between a salesman and a hit - man changes both their lives.,1
Was'nt really bad for Raw's first PPV of 006. Both men didn't really put a very good effort. Viscera got up only to get caught with a spinning heel kick by Benjamin for win against the big man. Later HHH is able to topple down Big Show & nails a Pedigree for the win. Jerry Lawler wins after a Fist Drop for the win.,1
"It was amazing, and truly worth watching.",1
"Mobile suits based on angels - Check! In retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, what with the "" War on Terrorism "" and all. But who cares?! The aforementioned Heero, initially a cold, hard butcherer, becomes more and more human, while still remaining in - character. < br / > < br / > OK - its a Gundam series.",1
"< br / > < br / > And then there's the giant robot fighting. The relationship between Heero and Relena, and Milliardo and Noin are joys to watch. It has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views. The women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely, if at all see, which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic.",1
< br / > < br / > The greatest positives of this series are it's characters. Char isn't given this label. But on it's fourth re - use scenes like this do get old. The first is reused animation footage of the Gundams attacks.,1
"Consequently, it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character. Personally, I liked Heero because of his stoic personality.",1
Old conflicts will end and new ones will arise. The way its plot twists and turns has u riveted. Gundam Wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war.,1
"This show is definitely one that shouldn't be missed. Gundam Wing is an amazing show from start to finish, every single episode is a joy to watch. The story though is set in an entirely different reality than any other Gundam show. Gundam Wing has more depth and emotion to it than any other Gundam show I have ever seen thus far. < br / > < br / > A perfect 10 / 10!",1
"the dubbing is simply flawless. Large parts focus on the diplomatic dealings of a war, not only the battles.",1
"Its truly saying something. The story is a very simple thread. Strangely, The Matador is a film about regret and loneliness. Forget calling them real. It has a subtle way of connecting with the audience. No, the focus is what Brosnan and Kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other.",1
"Gundam Wing is a fun show. This does not happen in Wing. Personalities don't change, growth is never achieved.",1
"( most of them are Caucasian in fact with a couple of non - Japanese Asians. ) He may sound a little too old for his age, but Duo's English voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal Japanese one. For one thing, the characters'personalities come across more "" directly "" than in the Japanese version. Kirby Morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as Trowa Barton.",1
I mean it can always be worse. I'll chat about that one later.,1
"Emotion. Normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a "" small "" battle is to have it take a half - hour - something that would never happen in real life. < br / > < br / > But the magic of Gundam Wing is in the details, and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having. Mobile Suit Gundam Wing is the Fourth series in the continuing Gundam chronicles.",1
"Operation Meteor. The Alliance forces catch on... < br / > < br / > Gundam Wing is the most popular and most successful of the entire Gundam Series. Dear Readers, < br / > < br / > With High Expectations, Human Beings leave Earth to begin a new life in Space Colonies.",1
"This movie is very smart, abide rather short 76 minutes film. This movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story.",1
"The claustrophobia is, at times, almost palpable. That's not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. Worth a nice long look.",1
Any more and it would have started to drag. I also found his dialog with the callers pretty funny.,1
"A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia. I would recommend checking it out if you get a chance. It's not perfect, but it does what it's supposed to do.",1
"Yesterday, I caught this movie again on TV so I looked at it a bit deeper. < br / > < br / > I always liked movies like this ; crime movie with big touch of humor. He'll make you smile and admire him at the same time. Great Brosnan in not equally great movie.",1
"But it won't be an easy journey. And Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation's got'em all. From Egypt, the crown is to be transferred via steamship to San Francisco. Any way you look at it, Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation is a winner. However, that doesn't mean someone won't try to get their hands on the treasure. ), the beginning scenes really drew me in.",1
As usual Lorre is his charming self as the debonair Mr. Moto. It's fast paced and fun.,1
i wont ruin the ending. i thought that this was a great movie for kids. i totally disagree. no it wasn't scary and wasn't meant to be.,1
"This charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful "" The Legend of Boggy Creek "" is a follow - up in name only.",1
the men get hurt and kids rescue them with the help of the creature. i don't think it's garbage. haunting shots of the arkansas swamp and scenery were neat. it was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary either.,1
"Strictly for the 8 - 12 y / o set, older kids will get bored think it lame. This movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare.",1
"I just watched it and watched it. After years of training, the lamb is made into a really REALLY evil looking thing.",1
in a not so conventional sense of the word.,1
No other story had such a unfinished ending...,1
But even the voice acting is far better than much released today. Look hard for it and you will be quite satisfied!,1
"Instead, The Matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study. Julian Noble ( Pierce Brosnan ) is a hit - man. < br / > < br / > Sounds like the set - up for a by - the - numbers comedy thriller, doesn't it? Or a "" facilitator of fatalities "", as he prefers to be called. But it isn't. But when Danny opens up about the death of his only son, Julian tries to change subject with a dirty joke.",1
Any old - movie buff will love this.,1
"As entertainment value for 21st century viewers, it fails miserably. Meanwhile, their biggest talent - Al Jolson - is noticeably absent. However, for the student of early sound films and history, it is a jewel. "" The finale is also overly long, but it is really enjoyable with all of its dance numbers. It is very hard to rate this film. Even at a high salary he could not be compelled to join in.",1
")... and on and on it lumbers, grinning and squeaking away in fabulous gramophone quality Vitaphone sound. THE SHOW OF SHOWS is pretty gigantic. It is all so demented. Row after row of "" Doll "" characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor.",1
Wantabedde is even better.,1
"Whoa, how did that get in there!",1
"I'd rather have one of those cars, too. I also thought that Patti Yasutake ( Umeki ) was simply fabulous in her role as comic relief. And now I understand why my mother felt the way she did in those closing moments. < br / > < br / > I think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the 80s.",1
"Relax, it's a comedy. I just have to throw my two cents in. He's an underrated and under - appreciated actor. Would I see it in a theater? I can't think of any, at least not in Hollywood. Nor can I think of one who's as successful.",1
I just wish I could get a cleaned - up TV version. The students can either buy or rent the movie.,1
"Danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter Julian. < br / > < br / > Richard Shephard directs with style working with his own material. But did he really? Someone knocks on his door, and knowing it's Julian, the paid assassin, he refuses to answer. In fact, we have already seen him in action, doing what he does best. Philip Baker Hall puts an appearance as the liaison between Julian and his assignments. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this odd couple.",1
"< br / > < br / > Well, that'about it!",1
"< br / > < br / > I noticed one reviewer uses this in a Japanese class. Not all the stuff is factually spot on, but the tone is perfect. ( Of course, Japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction. ) I saw this movie when it was new.",1
"Sakamoto : Why not? The fight then spills out from the office into the factory. First, they're both on the floor. Then Hunt jumps on a chair. Kazihiro jumps on the desk.",1
Being from the 80's I loved seeing the ugly pacer again. The film is a great film for any comedy lovers and 80's film lovers. this is a great film!!!,1
It's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all - out comedy farce. In many Japanese plants defects or problems are examined and fixed at the time it is discovered. I saw this movie again as an assignment for my management class. I beg to differ. Parts are bit dry but I think you'll find that it backs up much the movie also. Teamwork was emphasized. They perhaps made the company above all else. He was a perfect fit for the movie.,1
"Remember sayings like'Union Yes!,'' the Japanese are taking this country over,'and'Americans are lazy? < br / > < br / > This includes Buster ( George Wendt ), Willie ( John Turturro ), and Paul ( Clint Howard, Ron's brother ). Besides answering to the heads of Assan, we witness a delicate balancing act between Stevenson and his fellow union members, many of whom he grew up with. In Stevenson, we find an American working class figure of average intelligence with skills to chat people through misunderstandings.",1
"The end was excellent. Wow, it's been years since I last saw this movie.",1
Great movie all around!,1
"Julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid - life crises. Did Julian's victims deserve to die? The Matador is a strange film. The movie never deals with these questions. Sympathy for the devil, I guess.",1
He (? ) discovers the fish bowl and watches it. Both are innocent. It was great discussion starter in my class. The cat drops the fish into the bowl. A young boy and his mother are away from home. The boy drops the bottle of milk. It breaks.,1
"Just saw this film for the first time in 10 years, and was reminded why I like it. Surprised to see the rather low score for this movie. And I mean that in a good way. It's like an I. V. drip.",1
"Overall, I give it a solid 8.",1
This is a 7.,1
"The United States was just climbing out of its worst postwar recession, while Japan was enjoying an unprecedented industrial boom. Sherman, set the wayback machine for... 1986. But he has a fatal flaw common to many of us : he doesn't want to disappoint anyone.",1
"That's because it literally inspired obsession. Just like Tetris before it and more recently GTA III in 2002. Especially discovering those secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them. bang! Whether directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but they still do.",1
"The game ( mostly, but not always ) allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing... stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see. The graphics are, as I mentioned before, quite dated and very simple. Basically, if you got 100 % of any of aforementioned, you get a bonus, helping you reach coveted high score placings.",1
... but it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very fuzzy.,1
This was evidently long before he cultivated his good guy image.,1
"Good mystery, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.",1
"But this film is not noir. It's much slower, and the plot is trite.",1
A sleeper gem indie hit.,1
"Who's twisting who is the question. Also the only outing where the Whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in rain, unless he got sprayed with sea foam in Voice. It's still a competent thriller, the machine carried on without him perfectly, but something was missing : Dix!",1
"And last, we have our protagonist, Ed.",1
I was the MC in a few scenes ( from what I'm told. The thing is that they probably over edited it. Especially considering what we did that year. I can tell you just how bad this movie is.,1
"Simply put, if you are in the same "" wave - length "" as these people, you will find this movie amazing. The "" little - people "" also play a big part in the movie, especially when they are drunk.",1
"I could watch this over and over, and I often do! Just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie!",1
"The script is snappy and fun and the overall production values quite high. The couple live in a posh apartment and run an auction business that deals with valuable collectibles. Russ and Valerie are having discussions about starting a family. Harry, who becomes aware of the couple'e dilemma, offers a family of siblings for a 10 day rental period! Yes, if only life could be this way! This is a darling family film.",1
"The movie helped them better understand their own circumstances. This is also first time I had seen her cry. She replied, "" It means to be happy. """,1
Astounding.....,1
"Despite their completely different personalities and Julian's crude and insensible remarks, they become friends. After an hour, the film just runs out of steam. Nevertheless, and I can't put my finger on it exactly, I did enjoy this very much. Very amusing. < br / > < br / > Camera Obscura - - - 7 / 10 He proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just James Bond or cold - war spies. It almost feels like a new standard in screen acting.",1
I enjoyed the acting and it moved along well. and the boy who played child. I thought the movie was actually pretty good.,1
"Like I said before, it's refreshing. I found this show really late at night, and gave it a try. I hope everyone gives it a shot.",1
Clean wonderful! I found the series wonderful! It is truly enjoyable!,1
This is fun. They all loved it!,1
"Sequels usually make me nervous, however this one did pretty well for itself.",1
I loved this movie!,1
I've seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times. I could probably storyboard Nemo from memory alone. In a word : Showerman.,1
"It is worth let down just to see the first sixty. I like Peter Sellers, most of the time.",1
I ran across this movie on the tv and could not turn it off. ).,1
The violence is never really shown but often introduced. Good film.,1
"Peter Sellars is fantastic as the rich, forty - something serial womaniser. < br / > < br / > It's a great film, and the best gag is very last line. < br / > < br / > Try it, you'll like it. It's set at the end of the "" swinging sixties "".",1
I hope to see more of her around in movie - land.,1
"< br / > < br / > Pretty much, this is a smooth ride with Lupin. Lupin sets off for Morocco, looking for a legendary treasure. Enjoy. Throughout the entire feature she is seducing Lupin, and us viewers.",1
"Good enough to be one of the few I'd watch again of Lupin III movies. Other then the bad dub, it isn't bad. Lupin's trying to get a huge treasure.",1
"A simply wonderful little gem of a drama. But he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own. Joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving, but married girlfriend Anna ( radiantly played by Helen Hunt ).",1
"That is its strength, I think. < br / > < br / > It rates a 6. < br / > < br / > I found it plodding, but enjoyable.",1
Touching and sad movie.,1
Shepard was also down on his luck. Don't miss it. Then Pierce Brosnan called.,1
"( sorry, it's a Brazilian expression... ).",1
_ Waterdance _ explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of the spinally injured artfully.,1
"If I'd changed the channel, I would have really missed a treasure. It would have been so easy and tempting to make this a manipulative tear - jerker. No Hollywood happiness here.",1
"This film is real, not glossy or flashy. Hospital, the center of the story is Joel, very well - played by Eric Stoltz. This is basically his story. Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job as the angry Raymond. The orgasm in ward is both sexy and amusing.",1
( 3 ) Do you enjoy viewing boobs? Not that it matters.,1
It WILL please you. I really really really want to watch the rest of the movie. Although I've only seen forty minuets of it and I must say this is a good movie. It's really funny and I don't see how anyone could NOT like this film.,1
and 2 - they are trying to take it too seriously. < br / > < br / > Watch. Love.,1
!,1
"OK, it was a good American Pie. If you want to see full thing, get the unrated addition. Erick Stifler goes off to college with his buddy Cooze.",1
I wouldn't be averse to seeing an Oscar nod for this role. He is also experiencing something akin to a mid - life crisis. One is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble. This is Brosnan's film.,1
"< br / > < br / > Anyway enough about the Naked Mile. Not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex. First and foremost he lacks charisma, a Stifler prerequisite. < br / > < br / > While Coozeman is bad Erik Stifler is worse. You really can't care less about him. There are weak points though. Seriously John White is ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish. She shines above him as does the rest of the cast.",1
"The characters are likable and funny, the girls are hotter than hell. This feels like really OLD SCHOOL. Ti % s and As *, lots of boobies.",1
< br / > < br / > For example AP : The Naked Mile.,1
i was rather surprised at the end though. i just watched the movie i was afraid it's gonna disappoint me. it is not gonna become classic as the first two already did.,1
"Thanks for reading! < br / > < br / > * Many comment about the amount of nudity in this movie. Well... let's get real... doesn't that reflect the thoughts of teen guys like those from the movie? what would you like to see... smart books, romantic stuff?",1
"< br / > < br / > So, lay back and just enjoy. This movie is plain fun.",1
"I predict good things for him. The gags are a plenty, and they DID NOT hold back in this one. With all that out of the way, the movie becomes a no - limits ride. The entire cast does fine work. Classic.",1
"However, it sure has it's surprises in END!!! !",1
"Horribly bad, but good. I was laughing throughout.",1
This film is fantastic. I think its the best thing he's ever done. Kinnear is so goofy likable that his turn in end is truly gratifying.,1
"In the end though, they find out truth. The storyline is also great. After that another woman becomes paranoid when she's around her. She moves in with a guy who becomes her lover.",1
And scene with Dr. Wallace? Nathan was a very handsome cat. Drew Barrymore is very hot. The weird gummy worm was just weird.,1
Because the Doppelganger made out with Dennis and Patrick. < br / > < br / > I didn't get the ending! I liked it!,1
"It represents the drama of the intellectual man, the humanist, in a "" red "" world.",1
I don't expect this film to be well understood by viewers out of Romania.,1
I enjoyed the film and would suggest to anyone just out for a good time.,1
She makes it shine.,1
We see a lot more of her this time round.,1
"Hope Davis is well cast as the "" gem of a wife "". As an intense hit - man, his character is very sexual but even better, very funny.",1
"I noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on Dodie Smith's novel. < br / > < br / > Finally, it was quite touching that Snowball also had spots at the very end of the film. And what on earth could dogs'home do with such a huge sum of money?",1
This is also funnier than last film.,1
"This sequel is inferior, but not bad at all. But the dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is hilarious as the macaw. Overall, nice.",1
"I say, that's about 28 years - in dog years!!!! All covered in mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in the "" tin can. "" ! LOL < br / > < br / > 10 stars And now, we hear bit of it in this movie!!!!! Now, 4 years later, she, unfortunately, was released from the jail.",1
His'Wicked Witch of the West'homage is hilarious. < br / > < br / > Gerard Depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier - pawn of Cruella.,1
"Check out Sutherland's toilet in a particular scene,, very unusual. this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me.",1
"< br / > < br / > So far, so stupid. But the focus is squarely on the humour. To thwart that, the FBI tries to bust one of the mafia lords. It is funny. ( At least the synchronized German version is ).",1
"who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room. Do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one. And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? That Bond guy is gone. < br / > < br / > The visuals and settings are perfect - including bullfight, racetrack and Denver suburb.",1
This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.,1
A nice addition to my extensive DVD collection.,1
"Here is perhaps one of the finest. Excellent viewing and recommended to all. He is convicted and sentenced to hang. Max Winkler. * * * * However, his conviction is doubted by Capt. The Korean War has been dubbed Americas's forgotten war. It's called "" Sergeant Ryker. """,1
Very good picture.,1
"Rounding out the frontline is Peter Graves for the prosecution, and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key supporting roles. Engaging, riveting tale of captured US army turncoat who has to prove his innocence to avoid the hangman. Highly recommended.",1
"nothing was revealed to sooon in the movie,, so as to keep you guessing at all times. Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. This movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller, everybody played their part to the hilt.",1

"< br / > < br / > The film has a sense of relief at the end. Carla finally gets laid. They are beholden to each agent of the "" MAN "". Mr. Club Owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom. They get the $ money $.",1
I also think this applies to Eva Longoria fans.,1
Just a typical Hollywood film. This was a pretty decent movie.,1
And who were the real villains anyway? And did they use the'West Wing'set for the White House scenes? Disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes. Nothing was developed or explained sufficiently. Good for an evening's entertainment - but the plot was unconvincing. - I kept expecting CJ or Charlie to appear!,1
Worth a viewing if you like genre.,1
Eva Longeria. Overall Sentinel is a good film and i would recommend it.,1
"And second of all, this movie is the most fun I have had in years in a Theodore.",1
This movie reminded me TV series like 24 or Alias.,1
"I enjoyed this film. However, it is unfairly bashed here. Are there holes in it? Douglas does a fine job in this role. I don't always care the people he plays but he's an excellent actor.",1
"Tsk. All this because of his failure in a polygraph test, due to his adulterous banging of the First Lady ( Kim Basinger ). < br / > < br / > There are shades of Clint Eastwood's In the Line of Fire. Both featured aging actors, and aging veteran has - been heroes with a bit of a historical reference, who took the bullet in their respective tours of duty.",1
Guess what? This is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing. It works!,1
That was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pause. I never did get who he was or what his issues were. Surprises throughout delighting throughout. Very much worth seeing.,1
"And if you * do * find it, let me know so I can get copy, too! The boy returns happily to his fish, none the wiser. Both films are similar in their dream - like quality.",1
"We want to see something different, be thrilled and entertained. For starters, the casting didn't seem right. From Kim Basinger's delicious first lady.",1
Main song theme just lovely. 1942 costume designer did great job. Jeanette's and Nelson's movies stand the test of time. Boat crashing into his balcony served him right. Jeanette dancing was pure delight.,1
Why?,1
She makes a spectacular angel. This one is designed to entertain and it certainly does. The movie is a fantasy. Some of the closeups made me uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing magnificently. The music in this movie is beautiful.,1
"If you like musicals, I'd say you'd like this one!",1
She could do it all. Surreal 40s musical seem to be making fun of 40s fashions even as they were in current vogue. < br / > < br / > Great fun and nice to see the wonderful MacDonald in her jitterbug / vamp routines.,1
It appears that there's no middle ground on this movie!,1
That is a baffling thing to say. He should be a star. There was no politics at all in this movie.,1
"I always enjoy a good story line and this movie had one of the best I've seen in a long time. < br / > < br / > I look forward to another such movie, and will keep my eye out. ! I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. Have recommended it to all my friends!",1
Audiard made here a very interesting movie.,1
"Great film to view and enjoy, especially all the good acting from all supporting actors.",1
i wasn't disappointed. I very much enjoyed watching this film.,1
And besides there was two gay characters and I thought they reflected each other great. I completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie. One was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top.,1

"The makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and, lets face it, humorous. Which is what I'd like to think any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots. But I did really like the concept.",1
Strange and weird. Jacques Audiard is not a new - comer yet. The background story is less important.,1
It's hideous. < br / > < br / > Seek this out. The huge battle is exhausting.,1
It's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in edges of horror cinema.,1
"Definitely worth a look to any Buttgereit or "" art "" film fan.",1
"What it is it low - budget art, put forward in a simple yet poignant way. In fact, the most disturbing scene I found was the last tale. What's the best way to start a review of a movie like Der Todesking? < br / > < br / > It's probably fair to say that if you're on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you haven't seen it. It isn't.",1
"It helps to make this movie an effective one to watch. This movie is a perfect example of his work. They are artistically made, with also often deeper meaning to its themes. < br / > < br / > It's also really hard to label this movie. They are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story.",1
"Entirely unlike I expected, "" Der Todesking "" isn't exploitative or repulsively graphic! GREAT use of tragic music, too! The production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism, but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema. The subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful but also indispensable aspects of life. In between these already very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse.",1
Disturbing art in purest form! The last ( Sunday ) episode is so depressing and full of pain!,1
"Who wants to live forever? "" It consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death. Why? It harvests us. This is a most realistic film. Because death does not exploit us humans. At first glance it may seem very dark.",1

And he manages to do just that. Definitely worth look. Nicolas Mallet is a failure. Our hero tells his boss he is quitting.,1
"The cast is splendid, ditto the writing and theme.",1
"< br / > < br / > Their journey is a very learning one. Early's parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job. Kalifornia "" is a great film that makes us look at ourselves.",1
I don't care for Pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles.,1
All good words to describe this movie. Underrated. Spot on.,1
"I was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute. It's the sort of film Hollywood really wants to make, but just can't.",1
"Duchovny was top notch, as was Forbes and Lewis. This movie is great!",1
"This movie was not one of them. Pitt is dark, brooding and downright scary at times. And Juliette Lewis's performance although I can see how some may be annoyed by it I think it's amazing. But what I have seen is absolutely awesome! I've watched that scene at least twice now and I still think the acting in it is just wonderful. He turned out a great performance in Kalifornia.",1
"To help finance the trip, they decide to car share and advertise the fact. A top movie. Inevitably, mischief ensues.",1
I remember some emotionally intense Duchovny voice - overs. This proves very good writing and acting.,1
We have a staggeringly disturbing turn by a young Brad Pitt as Early Grace. The first is its cast. < br / > < br / > There are two things which really give this movie its power.,1
"Lewis's dialog and Forbes's reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the country. But he and Forbes are flat broke. Pitt is the walking definition of anbred Gothic refugee from Deliverance. < br / > < br / > For those who like their slasher flicks, they don't come better than Kalifornia. I have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film.",1
"The girl is a naive, frail creature that dreams a lot and loves cactuses. The road of no return. Kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals. On the whole this is a really good movie. It is one of the strangest couples ever. Don't miss it. A cruel ruthless murderer.",1
"I do like Juliette Lewis although I'm indifferent to Brad Pitt. It was realistic, tense, disturbing. Otherwise I kept thinking "" Agent Mulder "", which is a pity. < br / > < br / > Michelle Forbes was a treat. Why haven't I noticed her before?",1

The same for Juliette Lewis. He wants to write a book about America's most famous serial killers and she will make the matching pictures. Brad Pitt is incredible as Early Grayce.,1
"In my opinion, "" Kalifornia "" is much different from most serial killer films released during the late 1990s. Early is possibly drunk. When we first see him, it's late at night. Pitt is fierce in this film.",1

"On of the men behind the camera, responsible for the superb cinematography, was no less then Joe D'Amato. Tony Lo Bianco is terrific as the small thug pretending to be the city's biggest Don. The film lacks a strong female lead, as lovely and amazingly voluptuous beauty Edwige Fenech sadly just appears in a couple of scenes, and then still in the background. Great film, highly recommended to fans of Italian exploitation, and I hope to watch it again soon in its original version.",1
"< br / > < br / > The story of Boy Meets Girl is simple, and similar to Carax's two following films which comprise this "" Young lovers "" trilogy.

His movies are closer to Jean Vigo in "" L'atlante "", Jean Cocteau, and Guy Maddin, than Godard and Truffaut.",1

In the end, London and Kendrick retain the tag team titles. Let's continue. This was an okay match. Mercury is hurt. Get well kid.",1
The action was shoddy and no one cared who Batista picked for his partner. < br / > < br / > Overall Results : Kane defeated MVP in an inferno match. < br / > < br / > The Boogeyman beat The Miz in a terrible match. < br / > < br / > Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the Cruiserweight Championship.

Be warned. to attempt to end the year on a high note. His face was instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended Mercury's night early. There were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings. WWE has produced some of the worst pay - per - views in its history over the past few months.,1
High recommended. A word of warning - it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine!,1
"Without being one of my favorites, this is good for being a change of pace... even if only for a few minutes. They even save each other when one of them is in danger of life.",1

"If you are a fan, then you will probably enjoy this.",1
Nothing seems forced. There's a Wes Craven in Chicago feel to it.,1

"The visuals are exceptional. This cartoon is short on plot, but is a visually stunning piece of work. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is.",1
"Of course, Columbo gets him in the end. I don't know.",1
"Columbo being Columbo, he only reveals what he really knows when time is exactly right to turn the screws a little. < br / > < br / > There are some really priceless moments in this episode. Because he is wearing a large ring, the blow knocks her to the ground and kills her.",1
Enter Columbo. < br / > < br / > Excellent episode.,1
The murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act. Robert Culp is truly great as the short tempered Brimmer. It's definitely one of the better directed Columbo movies. It's also at the same time among one of the better ones!,1
"This was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, and it holds up well today.",1
"A very high - standard Columbo story which was actually the first filmed episode of the long - running series but was originally transmitted second ( after "" Murder By The Book "" ). Ultimately, the finale fittingly epitomises that Columbo has always been one step ahead of the murderer.",1
Perfect cast for a few - person drama.,1
"Memory - narrative, Resnais creates. < br / > < br / > The beginning is like a bizarre surrealist horror movie.",1
"The formal nature of relationship shared by these people is evident as even friends, they address each other using a formal you. This is one of reasons why this film can easily be grasped. Master cinéaste Alain Resnais likes to work with those actors who are a part of his family. L'amour à mort is like a game which is not at all didactic.",1
I must have been 6 or so at the time it was on TV. I had no idea it was part of a larger series. I used to love watching this.,1
"I sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a DVD release, but I don't think enough people have heard of it. Oh well, maybe I'll try e - bay... The puppets were also well done, although a little creepy. To this day I still catch myself quoting it.",1

Deaf secretary Carla ( Emmanuelle Devos ) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues.,1
It simply amazed me and my friends.,1
YET.,1
Everything happens very slowly. < br / > < br / > Is the film worth it? It is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie. So no matter how hard it gets there's always a slight joyous tune when they are together. Sasha becomes an outlaw. It reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by Ram Gopal Varma.,1
A woman borough a boy to this world and was alone. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. Everything else is to be watched... not told.,1
But it was a happy surprise.,1
It is sad and poetic at the same time. Acting is top notch all around.,1
"Cool you say, but no, this is real life. < br / > < br / > I really like this movie.",1
The premise may sound familiar. The Watchmen? It's this odd mash that interests me so much in this film. Unbreakable? Very wolverinish? This is not to say that action is not shown. This is where the vengeance and anger comes into play.,1
And suddenly he meets her. He hardly can be even called the anti - hero. She loves him for what he is. But it is not about Mechenosets. They try to run but it's hart to hide.,1
Kinda got feeling of an Asian fantasy film.,1
And it's still worth watching.,1
"Did Ridley Scott or anyone in the crew see the mini - series? And, my word, Blindpassasjer was first! This film is nothing less than a film - historic gem that in so many ways foreshadows the first Alien film. However unlikely, the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar.",1
"But it did, actually, once, and even in my own homeland, Norway. OK. < br / > < br / > But why do they always speak English in the space future? Because this is NOT the future, it's fantasy for kids. But, I also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones, the cheap ones, like the magnificent four seasoned BBC show « Blakes7 ». I admit. Star Trek ( Next Generation ) was my first space date, and since then I've switched partners regularly. It went on Swedish, danish and Finnish television also, in it's time, but that was a long time ago. I never ever thought of fact that this might have happened.",1
This movie is a masterpiece.,1
Wow.,1
"And like everyone else, I loved the outtakes! Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental crap. But this one, like TOY STORY, the previous film from Pixar, is a lot of fun. I hope the video has the new ones. I have to admit right off the top, I'm not a big fan of "" family "" films these days.",1
I was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film.,1
< br / > < br / > Devos and Cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong. Grady Harp Enter Paul ( Vincent Cassel ) a recent released ex - con parolee who responds to an ad to be Carla's assistant.

"We're still quoting little anecdotes from it here and there. I'm eager to see it again.. to pick up what I might have missed first time. Now this is what a family movie should be! < br / > < br / > This film is funny, heartwarming, clever and great fun for the whole family! There isn't one of them that you cannot empathize with.",1

"< br / > < br / > Ant Island is the home of a colony of ants. I watched it twice that month, and over three years later, I have seen it a third time.",1
The story is about an ant named Flik. I rate this movie 10 / 10. The music is nice to listen to.,1
< br / > < br / > Paul is given a'going over'by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt. It's now Carla's turn to enter a frightening new world. She is also deaf. He formulates a plan which utilises Carla's unique lip reading abilities to rip - off a gang of violent bank robbers. The leads are excellent ; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect.,1
"The great difference is the way that the story takes. What??? to my opening comment. Yes I know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is right. We have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village.",1
"However, the story is top - notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with. It is very much a circle of life, but not one that can't evolve with the ages. He needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth. All the bugs are finely crafted too. While Ant Island is nice, The water is rendered nicely, as is the foliage. < br / > < br / > When thinking about the animation, it is actually quite good. A lot of people disagree with me when I say that I really like Pixar's sophomore effort.",1
"You see, he spilled We are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers, who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food, consequences will be dire. It's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them, to imagine bugs the way a young mind does. The important thing is that it is still wonderful fun.",1
I just died laughing at that scene. I think they're all pretty good films! Early Bird. I was right! Good job PIXAR!,1
"The movie was totally Awesome and Cool. Even, Dot was cute. Hopper was a pure and perfect villain.",1
"It was a movie which defied convention, re - invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. Surely they jest. And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term < br / > < br / > After all, it's a film about ants.",1

9 / 10. The voice overs are what make this movie.,1
8 out of 10 You will love it!!,1
This is a FUNNY film.,1
"I wish she was in more films, and better ones than she generally is. Superb. I watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it. She seems to have a few coming up, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.",1
Check this one out. Everything is covered.,1
"All of actors turn in great voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, is superb. There are tons of laughs and cute moments in "" A Bug's Life "".",1
"But, I'm glad to say, it's not! ). Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing ( you can read their lips! A Bug's Life has real heart. Of course, it's beautiful ( every blade of grass, the tree, the rain... ).",1
A 7 out of 10. Bill Pullman plays the lawyer who tries to get them out.,1
The Philippines substitute for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong. An excellent piece of work! It contains neither gaffes nor the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into.,1
Paul Walker even has small uncredited role here. I couldn't believe the ending though. They agree. Beckinsales performance was a little weak though.,1
"I've long been a fan of her work, and this is no change. < br / > < br / > The film also has a brilliant soundtrack. Was it Clare Danes'Alice?",1
Who's that guy? 5!,1

Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. I'm nitpicking though.,1
"We didn't feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have. In short, this should, by all rights, have been much darker movie than it was. Worth seeing.",1
"Her's was the best performance in film. Danes, who has been oversold and over hyped, actually arrived as an actor in this film. The whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy. We are left to guess.",1
"This movie is no different. Well, ultimately they get caught, and end up in a Thailand prison.",1
How far would you really go for your best friend?,1
< br / > < br / > This is an underrated movie.,1
"Firstly, even though it would have been predictable and very Hollywood, I wanted a happy ending! Very disturbing. It was awful in two respects. Yes, it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this, there is a Sense that justice will be served and I did sit through it to see that. < br / > < br / > Also, I don't understand the ambiguity of the ending. No, Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before. And WARNING - SPOILER ALERT.",1
They are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.,1
"Where this film grabs me, however, is its ending.",1
It makes no difference young or old - - we all are human and subject to mistakes. - - I would definitely give this film two thumbs up. They were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison. < br / > < br / > This movie has a great setting ; it was filmed mostly in Bangkok Thailand.,1
But sometimes that fun can get her into trouble. You can see that from the beginning. The film is photographed very well also. Bill Pullman is adequate as the American lawyer living in Thailand. But first I want to say what is good about the film. We all have friends.,1
"Jacques Audiard the director must be making quite a name for himself in France, and rightly so.",1
"Whether she did it or not wasn't that important. < br / > < br / > 7 out of 10. Very realistic, very captivating.",1
"Watch it, you will be very touched.",1
"Bill Pullman's performance is commendable, too. What would you do? "" This is a particularly well acted and beautifully shot film. """,1
"But it can. It is very emotional and raw. This movie is cold, bare truth.",1
"Now it's time for ultimate survival and true friendship. Claire Danes did a great job as usual, she is a great actress.",1
"But they soon find out, when they leave or go is all up to them. Brokedown Palace is truly a one of a kind.",1
"This movie was simply too short to do this. The mental journey is missing here for some reason. Why? The relationship with the family members could also have used a bit more attention. I wanted to cry! To be honest, I hardly knew who Kate Beckinsale was before I watched this movie ( again ). It was just like the script was reduced to the main plot elements, and while doing this the psychological aspect was thrown aside.",1
I promise it will stick with you! This Movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorites!,1
I saw this film at a store in the cheap section. The film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocence.,1
The 103 minutes just breeze by.,1
"7 / 10 A super, unusual film from Audiard, Read My Lips is a pulpy, lonely - hearts thriller. Yet she finds an ami d'exploitation, if you like in Cassel's ex - con Paul.",1

Both Flynn and Ward Bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen.,1
"The movie also features some fine supporting actors and some fine acting throughout. Director Raoul Walsh was like the Michael Bay of the'40's and years before that. Fysicaly he also looks in top - shape. And I mean that in a positive way, since I'm definitely ain't no Bay - hater.",1
"< br / > < br / > Good film to catch Flynn at the height of his too - short time as a superstar. However, help comes in the form of a very unlikely individual. < br / > < br / > The focus of the film is on Corbett and his career rather than the history of boxing. Despite this, he rises to fame, even working as an actor. Corbett and his manager ( Frawley ) despair of getting the money. Finally he gets the chance he's been waiting for, a match with the world champion, John L. Sullivan ( Ward Bond ).",1
"overlooked as great performances, and this is one of them. Director Walsh makes silliness look smooth and extravagant. Smith is secretly taken with the handsome Flynn, but is put off by his brashness. Unfortunately, this story is positively ludicrous. Many of Flynn's characterizations were ( are? )",1
"The pair are head over heels in love with fighting with each other. Alexis Smith is Flynn'love interest. and a lovely supporting cast and it's pretty much perfect entertainment. Excellent Warner Bros effort starring Errol Flynn in one of his best screen performances. However, his work in "" They Died With Their Boots On "" takes some beating.",1
Just to mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim. He would go on to a great career as action director himself.,1
"It is an enjoyable film, but hardly does tell the real story of James J. Corbett. He defeated John L. Sullivan and lost to Bob Fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown. Possibly because he didn't have to wield a sword or be in a western. James J. Corbett, heavyweight champion of the world from 1892 to 1897, turned out to be Errol Flynn's favorite role. Ward Bond got the career role of his life in playing John L. Sullivan. Of course that was not shown on the screen. < br / > < br / > One thing though that I did like about Gentleman Jim.",1
"If you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer James Corbett, then this is probably not the film for you. < br / > < br / > What is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of Flynn as a boxer. First, Corbett was NOT a poor guy coming from a poor family, but was college educated and bright. Second, while he DID get Alexis Smith at the end of the film, they also divorced a few years later.",1
Here the idea is treated literally. This intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument.,1
In that respect James J. Corbett was truly innovated. Alexis Smith was beautiful.,1
Realistic? No. But wonderful.,1
"Not all the fights are in the ring tho, and it's all the spin off vignettes in Corbett's life that makes this a grand entertaining picture.",1
And Errol Flynn gets girl.,1
"It ' Flynn is downright magical here. Flynn, known mostly for his swashbuckling roles ( and his bedroom antics! ) He is the epitome of charm, charisma and appeal in this role. including a prominent judge. Frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as Flynn's manager.",1
"< br / > < br / > Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic Boxing Team in either 1928 or 1932. occurrences. None are more appropriate than GENTLEMAN JIM ( Warner Brothers, 1942 ).",1
The film's finest scene perhaps comes when a beaten Sullivan comes to congratulate Corbett. The films is attractive and has a consistent style without being flashy. It took him several hours of exciting and often amusing screen - time to prove his compeers were wrong.,1
This film enhanced my opinion of Errol Flynn.,1
"Reportedly, this was Flynn's favorite role and I believe that. Bond, too, was never better. You can just sense how much fun he was having here. Corbett's family is fun to watch, too, as they carry on in the stands during Jim's matches. Then it goes from a good film to a great one.",1
"Too bad, the film could have been great.",1
"< br / > < br / > Overall, Shaolin Temple is an enjoyable low - budget kung fu movie. My rating : 8 / 10. Not up to the quality of a good Jet Li film, but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre. All of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists.",1
"< br / > < br / > The cultural correlation I am tempted to make, is to compare the Shaolin Temple to the Alamo. At the end of the film, you too might be tempted to call out, Remember Shaolin Temple! This rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast - a veritable who's who of the Shaw stable.",1
Greater distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster. I rather think not.,1
A great idea : 11 stories about 11 September. 8 / 10,1
So the message is that the Power and the Greed ( symbolized by the Towers ) must fall for letting the people see sun rise and the flowers blossom? There is so much irony in this short film that it is close to be subversive. < br / > < br / > Do you need proofs about what i'm saying?,1
"three of them ( israel, bosnia and egypt ) should've been cut out. unfortunately, clips speak about misery of the people all over the world.",1
"Who, as viewers, are we to feel the most sympathy for? There is that moment of instant, unsettling attraction. Read My Lips "" is a drama. The constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown. Here is where this review begins to crumble, it is all of these items but it is moremuch, much more. The one where we think she loves him, but he is dark ( and here is where it gets even more fun ) and where we think he loves her, but she is dark.",1
"As the cat comes very near to the bowl, the fish jumps out.",1
"< br / > < br / > But returning to the film itself, what I enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it. First of all, I don't understand why some people find this movie so anti - american.",1
The weirdest comes from the Mexican nearly conceptual - art film... I am still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant.,1
"Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are made as well. This is a very interesting project which could have been quite brilliant. He fails miserably.",1
It will bring back your emotions from that day. I just recently watched this on the Sundance channel. < br / > < br / > The next from Israel involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report but is frequently told about the attacks. < br / > < br / > There are other films that I can't remember at moment but all of them are powerful. < br / > < br / > The next comes from Mexico in which nothing is shown but the sounds of that day. < br / > < br / > The Second Film from France involves a deaf women who writes a letter to her lover angrily while she is unaware of what is going as the T.

"Nair, good as usual, effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a muslim family in the wake of anti - islam hysteria that swept - - and still sweeps - - the states. Borgnine is very good and brave in it. < br / > < br / > there have been many allegations made that the film is anti - american : while i cannot speak for everyone in this regard, i am one american who found such statements to be completely untrue.",1
"This film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful. This is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world. < br / > < br / > This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans.",1
"It's a shame, although not surprising, that the movie was banned in the US. But just as some of the clips are beutiful others are absolutely brutal. Absolutely beautiful clip. Same goes for Sean Penn's clip which is superb as well.",1
"And some of the pieces are actually funny, but not abusively so. This film came highly recommended to me, and I pass on the same feeling.",1
"You never feel like you are watching piece of acting, this really is Carla. Mutual dependency, for vastly different reasons, bonds them. Paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help. Probably the best film of the year for me. The chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful.",1
"I was impressed the first time, and found it even more engaging on second viewing.",1
This is one of the best effort you will see in any Film. This film tries to touch every possible core of WTC. Definitely worth every penny you spend. There a teacher is trying to educate her students by informing them about Innocent People being killed in WTC massacre. Films like this are rarely made and appreciated.,1
"This was a true story, and that was what made it so real. WARNING : SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The piece that i found the best was the one from India. It was humourous yet just as powerful as the others. It was about how a muslim family, living in the States, had 2 sons, and one of them was missing.",1
If you can be strong you really should see this film.,1
"- Danis Tanovic ( bosnia hrzgovia ) : good images, makes us travel, for sure... Not a very good plot. Very well done. Maybe the less tender movie towards the us. - Mira Nair ( India ) : about the anti - islamic feeling that followed september 11th. Ken Loach ( uk ) : September 11, 1973, The Chile entered in a twenty - years long bloody dictature. Well, nothing.",1
"< br / > < br / > The segment of Amos Gital ( Israel ) is very boring and manipulative, showing more violence and terrorism.",1
the majority of the writers and directors choose to show that tragedy is not an American monopoly. would rather wreak revenge than make the world a safer place. Probably the most'anti'segment comes from Ken Loach who is definitely not towing the British New Labour party line.,1
"But in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone. Loach has his exiled Chilean man quote St. Augustine, to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage : anger at the way things are, courage to change them. < br / > < br / > Ironies abound in several stories. This is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the 6 year olds. Imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war.",1

The acting from < br / > < br / > the excellent ensemble cast is incredible.,1
"The plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless. The goal was for brothers to collect the haul, and the parents to claim the insurance. Murphy's Law intervenes in every possible way starting with Andy pressuring Hank to do the job himself.",1
There's no percentage in trying to Beat the Devil.,1
His flat belly days long gone. The acting is superb. Butmom and pop's jewelry store? No guns. Nobody gets hurt. No problem.,1
The Direction by Mr. Lumet is outstanding.,1
It was all great.,1
I'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist.,1
"Like scary good. Nothing resonates on a deeper level. < br / > < br / > This movie isn't at that level. And I thought - - wow. < br / > < br / > Philip Seymour Hoffman is really, really good in this movie. Since the film has no opening credits, I couldn't even remember who had directed it.",1
There is definitely less violence in'Devil'than'No Country. 'The acting delivers as well.,1
"We must turn to the French to remember how satisfying, subtle and terrific a well - made film from that genre can be. It's as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films I've seen all year. All action takes place in depressing, seedy and / or poorly lit locations. < br / > < br / > Audiard has fashioned some modern twists, of course.",1
All the actors are totally engaging to watch and Lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in. I personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next.,1
Beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable. < br / > < br / > The story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve.,1
"Tarantino once remarked on a melodrama from the 1930s called Backstreet that "" tragedy is like another character "" in the film. It's bleak as hell, unforgiving as Satan, but also absolutely riveting 90 % of the time.",1
"When an audit is scheduled in his department, he becomes desperate for money. My vote is seven. The violent conclusion shows that the world is indeed an evil place. The eighty - three year - old Sidney Lumet has another great work and it is impressive the longevity of this director. Nanette reacts and kills Bobby but she is also lethally shot. After the death of Nanette, their father Charles Hanson ( Albert Finney ) decides to investigate robbery with tragic consequences.",1

The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil.",1
"< br / > < br / > But let's stay with this movie right here. The cast list is incredible, their performance top notch. I can only highly recommend it, the rest is up to you!",1
"Highly recommended. Amy Ryan also performs her job adequately. Many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here, not least of which involves the use of his characters. 8 / 10. That's not to say that Hawke is not bad ; in fact he is quite above adequate, in a troubled role that suits his style.",1
"I think this film is like a rebirth for Lumet. But, he was not having too much luck on his most recent works. Also, I think the ending of the movie is perfect. The performances are brilliant. We need more movies like.",1
"I certainly was not sorry. < br / > < br / > Albert Finney plays a father common to his generation. < br / > < br / > Younger brother, Hank is basically a screw - up. The crime goes terribly wrong - thus beginning an examination of the three men in the Hanson family. He has always been too quick to criticize and admonish. It is Andy who concocts the scheme to rob his parents'store, and he gets weak - willed Hank to commit the act. In fact, as you see, I rated it five stars.",1
"Andy proposes a low - key robbery of a small Mall mom - and - pop jewelry store that promises safe, quick cash for both. His life is beginning to crumble and he needs money. The glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men's parents - Charles ( Albert Finney ) and Nanette ( Rosemary Harris ).",1
"The man is a thief, but Carla gives him a chance and covers for him when needed. The main reason for that is because it was compared to a Hitchcock movie. Fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie. Paul Angeli is a 25 year old and completely unskilled ex - convict.",1
"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a deviously stylish morality tale, and quite a dark, bleak and depressing one at that. I am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007's films. It is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to events about to unfold, as there are twists and turns.",1
"Don't miss it. Says Andy : "" Nobody gets hurt, everybody wins. "" Action is character, after all. By contrast, the drug dealer's condo looks more like a string of Mondrians. I love them. """,1
Albert Finney as their father seems to be in a constant state of rage but then the script calls for that. The robbery goes awry and two people die. Most of the film is concerned with the aftermath. Marisa Tomei as the older brother's cheating wife at the age of 42 puts in sexiest performance I've seen in many a year.,1
"I should mention that the non - linear storyline is quite easy to follow. Hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with Hawke were positively electric. ! What an extraordinary crime thriller! Ordinarily, that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece.",1
"At age 83, he has apparently made a deal with the Devil to deliver one last great film. Also amazing is how Lumet utilizes the multiple POV and shifting time - frame approach. < br / > < br / > Of course, what Lumet is best < br / > < br / > Contrary to popular belief, Sidney Lumet is not dead.",1
"Also, I really loved the theme song.",1
I sincerely hope that at least the first season of Cosby is released on DVD someday.,1
"After seeing movie 25 times plus, I still cry. The end was great.",1
"You must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place. What a good example for screenplay writers, actors, directors and cinematographers to follow. The plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office. Four stars out of five for me. < br / > < br / > Once you have seen this film, like me you may want to see it again.",1

"The Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well scripted, and thoroughly entertaining. PERIOD! < br / > < br / > Thank you for taking time to read this review. I have read many comments on this site criticizing The Blob for being cheesy and or campy. Bottom line is, I love this movie. BWP was pure excrement. It just can't be done.",1

Most film is not art. It dominates too much. The trick to loving the film is being able to enjoy this playfulness. Instead it is a visually interesting film. The film only feints towards these genres and others at times. There are none of these. Instead the film touches on and moves through a number of different genres.,1
"Life is sort of like that : we look, see, observe, integrate, process, and make of it what we will. This is an interesting and visually captivating film, but many viewers will find it an overly long discourse about very little. < br / > < br / > In using this form of film making ( much as she did in the strangely beautiful'Beau Travail') Claire Denis has developed a signature technique. Perhaps watching again will change that.",1
"Whatever she films, you get it in the end. But not Denis. She may even punish him. But was it a movie or a dream?",1
"He is everything his father is not and has every relationship his father is incapable of sustaining ; no wonder he thinks his father is "" a lunatic. "" We have to figure out from skylines and incidental signage that he is traveling to Geneva, Korea and the South Pacific.

The Intruder ( L'Intrus ) "" is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life. There are lots of images of water for cleansing and for distancing. There's an additional extended scene where he seeks his father in woods while carefully carrying his angelic baby in a pouch.",1

"This movie opened my eyes to their bravado and courage. I really enjoyed watching this movie about the Delany sisters. What a pair. Both sisters are quite different from each other. I knew of them, but that was all.",1
"She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. < br / > < br / > Still, the movie works as a light romantic fantasy.",1
The movie has a lot of good things about it. The cast is very solid. This one is not as obsessive as that one but Novak is just as captivating.,1
and Ernie Kovaks. GimmeClassics I enjoyed the movie and its cast.,1
"worth a look. you'll recognize aunt from "" Murder by Death. "" this is an honest attempt to make a bewitchingly sweet love story. jimmy stewart plays a hapless but stolid "" straight. "" the comparisons are obvious.",1
LOL. IT'S STILL A HOOT!,1
Ha! Kim alone makes it a winner in my Book. My # 5 film of 1958.,1
"It's pleasant, but with no depth whatsoever.",1
"This, "" Prodigal Son "" and "" Eastern Condors "" are my favourite Sammo Hung films. < br / > < br / > Great score, too.",1
"Considering what I think of jazz, it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world! < br / > < br / > The film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches. They are neither the baby - sacrificing nor the all - powerful variety.",1
"Jack Lemmon is her brother, ditto. It's called "" a low dive. "" Take the character of Ernie Kovacks. < br / > < br / > But never mind all that. Elsa Lanchester is Novak's aunt, also a witch.",1
Is it screwball comedy? She decides to tell him her secret. Is it a romantic comedy?,1
This movie is Miss Novak's Golden Moment. She was a thinking youth's Diana Dors.,1
"She started out merely to alienate him from his fiancée, her stuck - up college In short, it seemed to its producer, perhaps, box - office magic. And so it proved to be. The plot's main crisis in the film comes to pass when in reality Gillian falls for Henderson, who does not believe in witches at all.",1
"Not having seen it for a while, we decided to take another look at this comedy. "" Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at top. Ernie Kovacs is also seen as the writer Sidney Radlitch. Bell Book and Candle "" was shown recently on cable.",1
"The gestures Nicky makes when he's showing Redlich his powers especially struck me. I watched this movie after watching Practical Magic, and the older film was far superior.",1
"< br / > < br / > Worth your time, if you like Kim Novak. The Greta Garbo of my youth.",1
"Although I agree that it's a good but not great movie, for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned, I still enjoy it.",1
I have seen this movie. There is less population of girls. This is the major change in society.,1
"It has style, substance, a great cast, and terrific production values. < br / > < br / > What I rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative Xmas movie.",1
"As a Pagan, I must say this movie has little if any Magickal significance. < br / > < br / > "" Witches can't cry. They don't have time for silly things such as love. "" Queenie. Why, they can't shed a single tear because their heart is full of Magick.",1
"Hermione Gingold even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of Grand Witch. I have seen the movie a half a dozen times, and I never can. as a befuddled writer.",1
"In fact the film can be seen as the flip side of "" Vertigo "" with it's happy ending. The cast is terrific.",1
"this is a wonderful film, makes the 1950'S look beautifully stylish. Kim Novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern - day witch with one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity. Perfect.",1
"He supplies the warmth, she supplies the coolness, and somehow, together they spark. < br / > < br / > "" Bell Book and Candle "" was filmed on a charming set that replicates New York. Jack Lemmon is very funny in supporting role as Gillian's brother, a musician in the witch and warlock - laden Zodiac Club. Stewart, in his last foray as a romantic lead, costars with Novak as he did in Vertigo, and they make an effective team. Marshall wore a toupee, and when he walked through a doorway, his toupee caught on a nail and stayed behind, dangling in the doorway as he walked on stage. The movie is loads of fun. In The most expert of them is the sultry, soft - voiced Gillian, who would love to be normal.",1
I have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good. Boy was I wrong! This movie grabbed my interest after first 5 minutes and would never let it go. These songs actually tell a big part of the story and are certainly a welcome addition.,1
The first stirrings of romantic / sexual love left me dazed as I left the theater.,1
"< br / > < br / > The sad little film is done without any dialog, but it's pretty clear what is happening. Well, the wooden man tries again and again to chase away the hand and do his own thing. Generally, I am not a huge fan of stop - motion films and at first RUKA didn't capture my attention.",1
"The hand, for instance, is clearly someone's hand in glove. ). Then he goes about making a pot. Everything else is clay.",1
A must see. < br / > < br / > Beautiful and haunting film.,1
"An absolutely brilliant film! He becomes brainwashed ; an intellectual zombie. All because of the constant fear he had to live with once he escaped hand's strings. Once dead, the hand paints the artist as a great person, a national hero. That was obviously not acceptable.",1
"Yes, Louella's in the film as well. That's one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can mourn.",1
What surprised me was the stunning performance of Doris Day.,1
The character was a butcher now soldier. But this is an excellent example propaganda. They crash. We shoot one of pilots so Herbert takes over. Now I understand. She goes with him and it's love at first sight.,1
Sorry that's my own little rant.,1
Anupamji as always brilliant. So quit different role that she isn't in to. Shahid has done fine work. I give it 10 out of 10. Great music and lyrics. Sweet film of the year.,1
"And the movie follows the descent of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, contrasted by the ascent of The Dandy Warhols. < br / > < br / > First, it treats Anton Newcombe as a disappeared person.",1
and the Jonestown seminal fall from scene instigators to bickering wannabes. Dig!,1
"). Damn, was that a lot to take in. I recommend this to any music / film fan. I was pretty much mesmerised throughout.",1
I just wonder how that came to be made.,1
< br / > < br / > just watch it... seriously,1
< br / > < br / > Recommended mostly for music and the two fantastic bands. And the rivalry between the Dandy Warhols and Jonestown has been milked. The truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film. Although DiG!,1
""". on DVD. Tonight! A good experience Anton is this film.",1
"Most of what you see is of the bands on tour. I recently rented this doc, having remembered hearing about it from IMDb. You don't need to have a particular love for documentaries, or either of the bands. com and being intrigued by the premise.",1
"And jettisoning all credibility in process. If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper, Taylor's Peter Fonda. In Dig!",1
"But Courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of Anton. is more towards Anton and the BJM, as they have a lot more substance. < br / > < br / > Anton is very unstable. They are the most dysfunctional band. There is never a dull moment in Dig!.",1
"The human ( imperfect ) element was also woven in, to create some drama and drive the plot, as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution. Alok Nath is such a terrific actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays, he almost steals the show from young stars.",1
The music and careers of the two bands are simply backdrop. The movie is about Anton Newcombe. < br / > < br / > No such luck for Brian Jonestown Massacre.,1
DIG!,1
A must for any music snob. Just watch this film and enjoy. A really cool flick.,1
DiG! Rock n'roll is a messy business and DiG!,1
"For example, why is Anton's music so conservative? In the Dandy Warhols case, the answer is obvious : to make lots of money and be famous. But why? Anton Newcomb's case is more interesting. Because, one suspects, this is not about music.",1
"It's rare to follow a group so closely for so long. I couldn't find anyone to watch DiG! To me, this just shows how powerful good music can be. with me because no one I knew was a fan of either of the bands.",1
What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure. Sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world. Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols. By the time the Dandy War Newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience ( getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan ).,1
These are the people who really enjoy the film. Yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured. < br / > < br / > Type 1 : OLD PEOPLE.,1
You'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible. It should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese. Hmmmm... hahahah! Her air time in the film was pretty short though.,1
"Except, for the drama part. I watched this movie alongwith my complete family of Nine. I rate the actress playing the role of Bhabhi in the front league. Art immitating life? The background music is augmenting the "" soft focus "" of the movie.",1
These kinds of things DO happen. No preconception.,1
2 thumbs up.,1
WOW!,1
she's an AWESOME actress! ! The jokes were great!,1
The chemistry between the two also lifts the movie. This is something you don't often feel. don't let subject matter put you off.,1
And it's still not at the top of my list. But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding.,1
Kenneth Branagh was tolerable.,1
"Not a serious, but hilarious adventure. < br / > < br / > The story mirrors life.",1
Family and friends feel the same way about it. !,1
I found this flick ambitious and humorous.,1
"I found this movie quite by accident, but am happy that I did.",1
"Jane is extremely intelligent, but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary. When Richard takes her to London, they find the right man for the job. What Jane loves to do is to lose her virginity, at any cost. His fee is exorbitant, but they agree.",1
I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady. Thank you for letting me express my opinion. She pulled it of flawlessly.,1
"I never heard of this film before. And look at her eyes! And very fine job by Branagh too! I was right, but I was also wrong. Gee!",1
Tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances. One comes to care deeply for two of them.,1
"). Awards must surely follow, though not, alas, for this fine performance. 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10.",1
"The movie is more than good, but not extremely good. < br / > < br / > Minus point is common story of Bollywood movie.",1
So grateful to the BBC for releasing this series on DVD and Video.,1
Great actresses all around Wish that I could see it again. I would love to have this on video. Top notch series.,1
I could watch it all over again. Perfection. It's such shame that this really is the end.,1
The film belongs to Inventor - Underdog genre. < br / > < br / > It is that and more.,1
"As a period piece, it's more accurate than not. A scent of "" Pleasantville "" camp hangs around this flick.",1
"The supporting cast is great, as well. This film has it all. Boy, was he wrong!",1
"We see a images of a blue - gray town and its people : mostly miners working for the Olga Coal Company. Quentin asks Homer, "" What do you want to know about rockets? "" Homer quickly anwers, "" Everything. "" Then he wants to build a rocket. "" A melancholy violin tune fades with this image.",1
KUDOS!! to all involved this masterpiece! He pulls of every scene with sheer class.,1
The acting in this movie was superb.,1
"Actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison. Frankly I think the director ¡ [UNK] achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates. October Sky is a highly lauded movie, and it ¡ [UNK] easy to see why.",1
The thing I loved most had to be the music. I loved October Sky.,1
I went on to get my degrees in Physics and Computer Engineering. The Rocket Boys went on to make great lives for themselves.,1
The casting adds to its perfection. I don't like family films. Not one actor feels out of place. The best is easily Amrita Rao. So what was the flaw in the movie? And the music was very boring and bland. So a few plus points. The director's last movie ( MPKDH was complete stupidity. I am far from a fan of Shahid Kapoor.,1
< br / > < br / > Why aren't pictures like recognized more at award times? It is the epitome of an American story that is well done.,1
"Now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars. Not to be missed. Highly inspiring movie, which lifts up your spirit sky high. He is a perfect actor.",1
The title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around Sputnik. They were shocked to say least.,1
Not bad at all! It's kind of a feel - good movie. The story is good. The characters are really good. He and his friends begin to build rockets.,1
I know I did! I figured I would see the movies that I missed. This movie appeals to all ages. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!,1
Von Braun offering condolences about the failure.,1
"Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity ( and he even resembles Owen somewhat ) that just oozes from the screen. Take the time to see it, with kids : you'll all have a lot of good laughs. But, that's what you find out when you see this movie.",1
"A simple and effective film about what life is all about, responding to challenges. But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough.",1
"October Sky "" feels and looks oh so familiar. You call it a miracle. "" And it is. Perfectly played all around.",1
"Standing out in all of the glory : Laura Dern as Miss Riley. From this point on, his look at life will never be the same. < br / > < br / > The characters are also extremely well developed. Homer is not exited about that future.",1
< br / > < br / > We are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country. See It!,1
"It's nice to see nice kids in a modern - day film. I would like to have a little less tension between the two. He's likable, as are his school buddies in here. Frankly, I don't know but I liked the story. Once again : I wish there more of these kind of films made today.",1
"This movie was amazing! They were so sad, it seemed. 2. )",1
"I didn't want it to end. It tears at you, lifts you up. Best of all, the film is uncomfortable. And "" October Sky "" accomplishes just that. With lit helmets and bent posture, they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness. But Homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps.",1
I definitely recommend seeing movie! Every time you see it is so suspenseful. All age groups will love this movie! !,1
So we compromised. The child actors were not bad to watch ( the adult performances trended toward cheesy ).,1
( That was for dads. ) Don't buy the DVD.,1
< br / > < br / > 3. Billy is suppose to get 30 dollars after he's eaten all the worms.,1
"I rate this movie 7 / 10. The kid actors over exaggerate on many things. < br / > < br / > The acting is OK, probably the worst part of the movie. They think it's apocalypse if Billy does not eat worms.",1
"It's done in present times, lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage, but I do. I hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying. It was a very sweet, you feel nervous yet excited, song "" Do Ajnabe "" shows that very well.",1
Hilarity ensues with a bunch of different way to cook the worms. Saw this today with my 8 year old. I thought it was cute.,1
I really liked the movie.,1
awesome work. nice acting as well.,1
"Or Erica, who at 4 1 / 2 feet, is a giant. But Fried Worms is wonderfully disgusting. Then he throws them at Joe's face. Ewww! But not immediately.",1
< br / > < br / > A bet is made and Billy has only so much time to eat 10 worms or else. I sat with my children as we watched this film.,1
"Another boy responds, "" Maybe he's crazy! "" and the entire group laughs uproariously. First and foremost, the writers capture'kid dialogue'better than just about any other children's film I've ever seen. < br / > < br / > But once at the theater, the film won me over for a variety of reasons.",1
"You will enjoy it as much as they do! Even parents, great connection between father and son. This was refreshing for me. Haven't we all suffered this one time or another. and she is no bully!..",1
"He is not stopping singing just to annoy me!! "" Have fun! For once, I did not guess the ending!",1
I thought the kids in the movie were great. It is a major problem in schools today.,1
< br / > < br / > The film may sound gross but there are a lot of messages in it. It is a feel good fun film and not just Fear Factor for kids.,1
VIVAH is in my book THE BEST MOVIE OF 2006! ! The songs are BRILLIANT.,1
"It was also nice to see ), which might not be such a bad thing. Movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons. The ending of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels ( How to Eat Boiled Slugs? Escargot Kid'Style? Her smile really warms up the screen. She's now 14 and is growing up to be a beautiful woman.",1
Pre - adolescent humor is present in large quantities.,1
"Oh yeah, I almost forgot, the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent. But somehow, it did not ruin the movie for me.",1
"Girls will love it because of the opportunity it affords to say, "" Boys are so weird! "" Don't miss... We had even more fun the second time around and everyone raved about it.",1
"But who the hell did cast Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich. Nice theme. < br / > < br / > Patrick Warburton - does a horrible job as Jeff, he is not at all suited for the role. < br / > < br / > Cast is really very important for viewers to like it. With little extra tuning it can become a very popular show. The show is really funny.",1
Patrick Warburton is the key. < br / > < br / > Do yourself a favor.,1
"Surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series. One of the few grievances I have with series is the very obviously "" canned "" laughter.",1
"It works for him. < br / > < br / > I hope for all actors sakes that CBS gives them a chance. David Spade's character, to my surprise, wasn't the whole focus of this pilot. This show has the potential to be one of the best series, if just given the chance and time. Patrick Warburton was a riot, although at first i thought that I wouldn't be able to stand his character.",1
"Now, if the writers can just live up to what they have begun.",1
A nice ensemble of characters.,1
This movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional Indian values which are being replaced by western ones.,1
"i think the gist of the story is original though. i have seen worse. i also liked music. the action scenes involving the snakes was really good, i thought.",1
"! If you like Sci - Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends, then you will love this movie!!",1
I have never seen such a movie before. interesting... very interesting.... I guess hopping the border solves all problems. So many plot holes from scene to scene. This movie should be seen out of curiosity as well as what kind of movie DEFINES lame.,1
There are some holes in the story but didn't really matter. Oh and it's from Korea which has put out some of my favorite movies. I liked Host but not my absolute favorite. I enjoyed this movie and I had very low expectation due to all the negative reviews I read before going. Ethan's ( Behr ) hair looked so Asian.,1
! < br / > < br / > The 3d graphics were pretty damn good.,1
"It wasn't at all hard to follow. I am in the US and just saw it today. There was humor throughout, too.",1
"Storyline is extremely simple. I saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends. Otherwise, don't bother! They really loved it and that made me feel good.",1
That's probably what keeps this off TV most of the time. He stays at Hollywwod Hotel ( of course ). Naturally they fall in love. I give it a 7. Also Glenda Farrell has a few funny bits as Monas sister Jonesie. You can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself. < br / > < br / > Still the movie isn't that good.,1
"Powell hosted, sang, and kibitzed with Louella and her movie star guests. That's got studio in a tizzy. Of course both Powell and Louella went on to other radio venues. The whole story is covered in the Tony Thomas book, The Films Of Dick Powell.",1
"She is not the only real person in the script. Make - up specialist Perc Westmore briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble another. The interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a lyric has been left out on purpose. They end up singing "" Hooray For Hollywood "".",1
This is because i've actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as well of thinking their below their standards which i feel is very shallow. I can't believe currently this movie is rated a 6. 9. It was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema. This upsets Amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her.,1
"in what I believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo. It should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of Tinseltown - - "" Hooray for Hollywood. """,1
< br / > < br / > Kind of like an old swashbuckler film. < br / > < br / > I highly recommend it. ! A fabulous film. See it for sure.,1
The wardrobe is fine. The scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting.,1
"! Everyone enjoyed the film and it actually inspired wonderful discussions. I give movie two thumbs up! She based the character on a real person. It was loving, warm and fun.",1
I will definitely buy it. I loved her in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also terrific.,1
"( I'm a dork ). As an aspiring screenwriter, I notice those things! So much so, that I figured I'd write in. What really makes this film stand out I think is writing. Anyway, a really cute film that I recommend.",1
It's really cute and we can't wait for it to come out on DVD. They need to make more movies like Domestic Import. She was also in Austin Powers. I loved Mindy Sterling as mother. I remember him from WKRP. Adorable! I haven't heard them laugh like that in years!,1
This film just put me in a good mood.,1
I highly recommend this movie. The acting was great. ). I laughed the whole time.,1
I liked this movies. Its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained. There isn't a strong message from this film but its a good watch. There will be lots of women crying at the end of the film.,1
"Yeah, the poster is quite a horrible piece of work. < br / > < br / > Ahh, but that can't happen to rich kids now can it?",1
< br / > < br / > Definitely worth seeing. This could happen. It's in Spain moviemakers take women seriously.,1
"The premise is risky and slightly contrived, but the tone and depth of the movie takes a daring plunge for the good. Can you love a mirage? Their shoes is the first superficial, yet affixed with some glancing meaning, clue we get at their fragile identities. A ghost, a pending divorce reproach, regret & remorse. A new love? Or think you can't love? The rest is just details. Live.",1
"I saw this movie at the 18th Haifa film festival, and it is one of the best I've seen this year. For this and more I give this movie a solid 8 / 10. It might not work on a small screen, but it gave me goose bumps easily on a big screen. A set of talented actors helps him portrait a wide variety of characters. < br / > < br / > The movie presents a set of characters, which are loosely inter - connected.",1
"If you act in an inverse way, you will not have enough room for larger stones.",1
Well i do disagreed with the other comment posted. Piedras is much much better them Magnolia or any of the other films that were mentioned.,1
"5 different women are coping with their male partners and families. < br / > < br / > A must to all Almodovar's fans, and enjoyable to all. Surprisingly good for a first film, and worth the time in any standard. Women have never looked so attractive and pathetic as in Salazar's film Piedras.",1
"I highly recommend it. Ramón Salazar achieved a compelling film in his directorial debut, and proves himself as an efficient actors'director.",1
"The shoe - theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor. This has are used to make the connection and fast cuts. Frequent change of storyline keeps it from being boring or reaching TV - levels. All are transformed at the end of the movie. Isabel ( Ángela Molina ) is a bored rich lady. A telephone rings, a cigarette is lit, a song, etc. Several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters. But they are different.",1
It could also be seen as a kind of documentary. Principally it is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution.,1
Hats Off to Suraj.. Director has definitely given it much thought and actors have done it to perfection. A story woven around a marriage. But when you come out of the cinema hall you are very much satisfied and feel that ticket was worth : - ).,1
Don't miss it!,1
"Even by European standards, yes. And by God did they get it right!",1
"Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life, and I enjoyed it. The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone ; even most serious enemies were respected at the end.",1
The usage of colour texture and music is also to be commended. The genre is unique and not the typical expectation. Considering the lack of art with in African cinema ( or Black American Cinema ). But the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short.,1
I look forward to viewing sequence. I have rated this film at the highest possible rating.,1
"The little dialogue the film has isn't very delicate and this adds to the power of the film. But then i asked myself what next? You can see the intention in the design from the start to the finish. The character development is amazing. I first say this film as part of a "" black "" film festival. But it is so subtle you don't know how to read it! The common association of art without purpose isn't to be found here. Where can someone else see this work?",1
Now he is probably the key independent African filmmaker in the world. Showing the artistic diversity. It is so interesting where did this guy come from. I just love the mild comedy in it.,1
Excellent work...... Joanne I am eagerly looking forward to your next product.,1
"< br / > < br / > Clearly the movie belongs to Amrita Rao all way. In fact Shahid and Amrita make a cute on - screen couple, without a shadow of doubt. The song'Do Anjaane Ajnabi'goes well with the mood of this scene. < br / > < br / > Shahid Kapoor performs brilliantly too.",1
The factors which disturb the natural flow of things must be made apparent and tackled.,1
"< br / > < br / > Spooky huh! The only person that digs your music is yourself! "" That was plain nasty! Maybe that is why Prince started to run out of steam during the 90's because he ran out of his fathers ideas?? ?. < br / > < br / > Twenty years on from 1984, this film speaks loads about Prince's future in the music industry. How about the musical underscore which makes Prince even more evil when he smacks Apollonia to the ground in two separate scenes! < br / > < br / > Purple Rain is an entertaining film overall, as it is the soundtrack of Prince songs that boosts it's value by 110 %.",1
Morris Day other supporting actors provide comedic elements.,1
9 Tracks. Our 20th Century Fox Fans are not watching anymore. Hudson Horstachio is watching you!,1
And I really mean that.,1
Very cool landmark film.,1
the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it. He takes himself way to serious.,1
"The acting? < br > < br / > 9 / 10 Oh, boy, that sounded lame. I have to admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures. This movie defined the 80's, so just have fun with it.",1
"Despite that, it was still a very entertaining film! Plus, she is very attractive.",1
"< br / > < br / > Another major plus point is the performances of Shahid and Amrita. HSSH was almost unbearable to watch in some places. ( I needed several ) If you're prone to crying - take a tissue! Amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major star. < br / > < br / > PS. < br / > < br / > Although I really enjoyed the film as a whole, I do feel that it was too long. Both have acted very well, especially Shahid who looks great in the film.",1
"The entire main cast were just playing themselves. They were always friends. Most people don't realize how good the story is because it's judge by the acting. Now that I've seen it again I couldn't believe what I've missed all these years. Prince made sure that every moment in the movie was done perfectly. I've recently went back and watched this movie again from not seeing it in years. Plus, his dedication he puts into his performances is phenomenal.",1
The follow - up sucked. It should have been re - rated to PG - 13. 'This is an excell film. Really good.,1
I was told it was Prince. 1 with me. The movie blew me away.,1
"In the movie prince wasn't known as prince but as "" the kid "". I also like how clever prince was with the way he flirted with Apallonia.",1
"Very hit and miss. If you aren't a fan it'll make you one. Still, it adds charm to movie.",1
"), romance, and drama. Excellent movie, has it all, great music ( Prince of coarse!",1
"As the sum of its parts, not a bad movie at all. Third, give this movie a break! Why?",1
The music is great. This is probably his best performance. This is the only movie I've seen Prince in but it don't matter. There isn't to much to say without revealing the plot.,1
Certainly the best this year until now. That This is not about things and people that have gone bad. This is one of the best movies to come from Bollywood in years. It is as simple a story for a movie as it can get. Will they pass this test? Their relationship will face the test of not only time but also fortune.,1
!,1
"It got so popular that it became ridiculous. There is no debate about his musical talent either then or now. For a few weeks at least, Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. It didn't disappoint. It's like rappin'Granny commercial for Wendy's Hamburgers.",1
I loved it! I cried more than once.,1
"Purple Rain "" is such a movie in this category! ! Set in Minneapolis, "" Purple Rain "" accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics!! Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!! Purple Rain "" put Prince on map!!",1
Plus Apollonia is just simply STUNNING.,1
"The musical numbers are well staged and electrifying. The film is 90 or so minutes of posing but in truth it is easy to see why it is such a cult classic. The show - stopping performance of Purple Rain is the standout though. It is one of my all time favourite songs. He seems human and relatable. Appollonia Kotero makes a good debut as Princes sexy love interest. Prince is no doubt a musical maestro, albeit very eccentric.",1
"< br / > < br / > I already can't wait to watch it again, I really can't! Extras are terrific - particularly seeing a young Eddie Murphy pre - Beverly Hills Cop admit he is a "" Prince groupie "". There is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where Prince and The Revolution perform. The brand new 2 - disc anniversary Special Edition led me to buy it. ), it blew me away. It even makes Michael Jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years.",1
"How would a film about domestic violence be shot, then? Day and Benton even go so far as to make an Abbott and Costello routine funny, which takes some doing. That he can do this and still emerge as a flawed but vindicated hero is credit to the writing. < br / > < br / > Lastly, there's Prince.",1
But this astounded me. The real talent here is Thomas.,1
"Vivah is by no means a classic. Suraj's direction is simple but effective. Nothing more, nothing less.",1
Good going folks!.,1
Savage Island's raw savagery will scare the hell out of you! Trust me.,1
< br / > < br / > Give it a watch and excuse ending! This is a good film for 99 % of the duration.,1
"Plus, the director keeps things interesting throughout. It actually exceeded my expectations.",1
This affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending. < br / > < br / > The script was very good as was the acting.,1
Call it hard or soft or something stupid like that. I'm only giving this movie a 9 because you FREAKED ME OUT FREAKS. I would watch that over and over. Who ever came up with story is one sick person.,1
i would give this movie a high score if you ask me. He make us laugh together the most. they doesn't look to real. The actors look like they have a fun time.,1
Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! I love the sets and the location. Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester. This is the best and most complete version of the book on film!,1
"If you've only ever seen him as a not - so - memorable Bond, you've missed the thing he's best at. She arrives as a governess in the household of Mr Rochester, utterly friendless and alone. But a dark secret, and severe trials, lie before them both.",1
But its a Shahid - Amrita film. All in all a brilliant film.,1
I give this an 8.,1
"But watching this one almost equals to reading the book. And Zelah Clarke is, without a doubt, the only Jane that follows the description of the book. The other thing that makes this film so great is the clothes and the makeup of the actors. At the time I didn't pay attention to how close this television production was to the book. Recently, I watched the 1996 version of Jane Eyre and was very disappointed.",1
Using the title after such license is fraud. It was only faithful to avarice and arrogance of Hollywood. Artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism. Dalton's'Mr. Rochester'was very good but I absolutely loved Zelah's'Jane Eyre '. I saw it as a full length movie in 2006.,1
"Good choice. The two leads play off each other beautifully. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. She is dead on as Jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. < br / > < br / > I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. Criticism of her performance as "" wooden "" is misplaced.",1
"I have recently seen this production on DVD. Oh to be loved by a man like that! < br / > < br / > Finally if you never see another production of Jane Eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection! I also think this is the only production to include the "" Gypsy "" scene done correctly.",1
What really makes this a must see though is the casting of the two lead actors.,1
"The movie's success is, no doubt, due in no small part to their acting prowess. < br / > < br / > I need not divulge anything in the way of plot here. I only wish to explore the novel due to the immense curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has stirred within me.",1
"Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but the actress playing Jane is much too old. There is definitely scope for a TV adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it.",1
this was a fabulous adaptation of Jane Eyre. i know it was made in the eighties for TV.,1
I would love to see those two do Jane Eyre.,1
"Yes, the central romance is naively visualized. He has made the movie with FULL CONVICTION. Sooraj sir is back to what he does BEST. The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME. Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals.",1
"Jane Eyre is quiet, guarded. Some of the criticisms baffle me. Luckily, this version is actually about Jane Eyre's whole life. To have so much of the book up on the screen was an extra bonus. Ms. Clarke shouldn't be tall Sorry.",1
I recommend it to all true Jane Eyre fans. She only just met him and he asks her bluntly what she thinks.,1
"This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own. I cannot imagine anyone else in their roles. As well, the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly, and the sets fit the Gothic nature of the story. < br / > < br / > I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte tale. Her story, which Bronte told through Jane's own eyes, was both sad and inspiring.",1
"if there is anything better, I would like to see it. but so far there is none like it! I would say God'love is greater.",1
"Don't miss this one! But, it's the performances that are real pleasure.",1
"< br / > < br / > There are three TV mini series, released in'73,'83 and 2006. This "" Jane Eyre "" ( as it dares to call itself ) is indeed a slap in the face of Charlotte Brontë. < br / > < br / > The 1973 version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between Mr. Rochester and Jane are rendered in nearly their full length. length, consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel. Another problem is the casting of the main characters.",1
"All the other actors are very good too. yet, what a welcome irony! I just love it and love it! Dalton!! This review comes nearly 30 years late. This movie is now a part of me.",1
I could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again. I'd like to see it again because it's so good. The best one for me.,1
"It is very, very close to the book. And it still is.",1
"Dalton is a little tough to imagine as Rochester who Jane Eyre declared "" not handsome "". This production is a lengthy watch but well worth it.",1
"But I think it is well - worth re - watching, which is why I taped it. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role. : ) William Russ did a grand job as Hank. ( Yes, some of us still have VCRs. If you like everything to be perfect and make sense, avoid this one.",1
"< br / > < br / > Bronte wrote a darn good book. Rochester is, famously, not handsome ; Jane and Rochester are literature's famous ugly couple. I just can't see Bronte's Rochester abiding such Martha Stewart domestic arrangements. They are too fussy, too Martha Stewart. The lighting in this version is bad. < br / > < br / > I was irritated at first. < br / > < br / > As a long time "" Jane Eyre "" fan, I was prejudiced against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. I felt like I was listening to a high school play. And Timothy < br / > < br / > And the sets don't fully convey the Gothic mood of the novel.",1
Jane Eyre is now my favorite film and book. Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester. The plot is both haunting and inspiring.,1
"She is so versatile that I didn't recognize her. The dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book, which was very smart. ). There's lots more at the beginning ( Young Jane at Gateshead and at Lowood. ) Sure, this film might seem a little long, but it's the only version I've seen that includes part 3 of the story. Thanks, BBC ( PS...",1
"But Jane Eyre knew she couldn't settle for this course in life and respect herself. Someday I would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation. should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it. Why? < br / > < br / > A classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons ; when film producers start to meddle with a classic's very lifeblood then that classic is destroyed. A classic novel that ends with the heroine writing "" Even so, come Lord Jesus! """,1
"Jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich Mr. Rochester. Dalton is attractive, certainly, but no pretty - boy. I've read the book many times and I never felt that Rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast. ) Yes, this production is long ( good news for Bronte fans! )",1
"DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a gem of its kind. < br / > < br / > This film never received praise it deserves. In other words, it's one of the finest horror efforts to emerge from the 1980s.",1
A solid and enjoyable picture.,1
"Unfortunately it did, and Anthony Jr. looks willing to avenge attempt on his father's life. To say it keeps up the excellent work of the season premiere is reductive too,'cause there's never been a far - from - great Sopranos episode so far.

Dev Anand ( or Prashant ) and Zeenat Aman ( Jasbir / Janice ) are siblings brought up in single parent families. Prashant ( the brother ) on the other hand grows up in a less affluent environment but grows up to be a matured gentleman.,1
"A good entertainer, this movie retains it's freshness till date! One must admit, that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent.",1
They have not been spoiled. Zeenat gave her best and Dev as usual was remarkable. A must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful Nepal of 70 '.,1
But the life of hippies re ignited a story in Dev's mind to be made into a film. We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz. She has forgotten her childhood and Dev too. But the music by Rahul Dev Burman was well composed.,1
"I love the R. D. Burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story I found much to be moved by as I kept re - watching the movie. that are just distracting. This one grew on me. < br / > < br / > ( It is not about actual Hare Krishna movement, though the movie hippies sing a Krishna / Rama chant, as do a group of actual Indian devotees, unrelated to the hippies, in the opening scene of the movie. ) Also the English translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch, and as loony as it is I am grateful to him for doing it.",1
"The sister is romantic, wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of the society. In spite of this, the love of the brother - sister is the winner. This movie treats the subject in an entirely different light.",1

"There is not a sight gag or a punch line that doesn't click in this fast paced movie. The rest of us should love it! Naturally, they fall in love.

It's the same type of humor grown up. At least for a half hour a week.,1
"She even asks Jesus, why the father, son and holy ghost are all men. But, tragedy is to come. She is a woman and that is all there is to it. It is not your typical nunsploitation. There is so much that can be said about this film.

Certainly, there was enough torture on both sides.",1
"Flavia hangs out with the Moslems who take over the convent and get "" busy "" with the nuns in a strange set of scenes.",1
"This is a serious work deserving rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation. Perhaps coincidentally it was also director Gianfranco Mingozzi's singular attempt at narrative film - making outside of many well - received documentaries. Joining oppressors and perhaps unwittingly manipulating them to do her bidding, Flavia truly becomes the outcast she already felt herself to be, with expected tragic results. A lengthy drug - induced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on Ken Russell's otherwise far more flamboyant DEVILS notwithstanding, the movie turns out relatively stingy in the skin department, making something of a mockery out of its semi - porn reputation.",1
You can't go wrong with it. The film is slightly gruesome and sleazy at times. 8 out of 10.,1
"Flavia is a beautiful 14th century adolescent, forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent. < br / > < br / > Flavia is a downright mesmerizing film!

"It was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this all - star flick. I laughed through the entire picture, as did my entire family. Rob Reiner made a great laughing limo driver, and Gabriel Byrne a laughable neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the Sleepy Joe character and the whole mortuary and grave digger references. The cars and clothing were impressive, as was decorative, "" Vic's Place.

IT'S ALL IN VICK'S HEAD! This movie is great. Simply.,1

Dickens'classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite. David Warner is a good Bob Cratchit as well.,1
"Wow, what genius. It was surely the highlight of my year - - nay - - my life. Thank you Sci - Fi for another classic.",1
"This was the worst movie I've ever seen, yet it was also the best movie. Also, the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream. Best idea ever! is probably the best quote ever!",1

Any ideas?,1
! Maybe it was just too clever for certain people? I hear it is being or has been repeated on another network?,1
"< br / > < br / > Very good movie with good performances. For this viewer anyway, those days are long over. It's really the story of a good man seeking his god, justice, and what he is willing to do in order to attain it. Hard to say. He gives an honest and touching performance here. Mason finds the top man, and is faced with a dilemma. And that's the most contrived part of all.",1
"Besides, the violence is not the point. Moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder, as it were. And I have to believe that's exactly what the filmmaker intended.",1

He is such a versatile actor. Most often he is played as a jolly Santa type character. The movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter. He portrays a man who clearly loves his family. A wonderful movie.,1

"I'm going to give him cred, he grew up quick - and believe me that's good. But I'm more prosy than poetic. And it was rather cleverly portrayed. < br / > < br > I may be easy to please, but I enjoyed it. A nice story pretty well put together - by Canadians, quelle surprise.",1

"Another nice one is Ursula swimming fully naked in estate's pool. This is a standing - up encounter in which Luciana is down to black panties only. Hey, somehow I've gone back to the actresses'names in my descriptions.",1

He also feels unhappy and unsatisfied in his Job. < br / > < br / > Johnson looks for, Fineman, that certain pleasure and ease missing in his Family.",1
Sandler is amazing again... Its expression is fantastic. I have already become a Sandler fan.,1
The former roommates rekindle their friendship and strengthen their former bond. A powerfully wonderful movie. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife.,1
"The two of them made a completely believable team, and Sandler in particular made Charlie real, working through his emotions and feelings. Don Cheadle plays his former college roommate who unexpectedly reconnects with Charlie and takes it on as his mission to help him get better. 8 / 10 The opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears. This is not a Sandler comedy.",1
"The Hollywood industry and writers such as Safran Foer more than allude to 9 / 11 in their works. Now, I don't want to belittle their sufferíngs, but I sure would like to make a comparison. Now, this huge amount of cultural products, dealing with 9 / 11, turn the death of 3000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century. Ever since 9 / 11 the entire world is confronted with mementos, memorials and commemorations of 9 / 11. I have to admit, this movie moved me to the extent that I burst in tears. Always want to take about their feelings "". On a daily We have a war in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Birma and lots of other countries.",1
"Which Alan hasn't seen Charlie in years. Cheadle is excellent as usual. < br / > < br / > DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen ( 2. 1 Surround Sound. But somehow, he feels that his life is somewhat empty.",1
"One of best movies of 2007. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. Adam Sandler is becoming a very well respected actor. This movie proved that Adam Sandler is good actor, despite what critics say.",1
There is inherent danger in the process. Cheadle's Alan Johnson is equally subtle and very Don Cheadle. It is Alan who has task of gingerly opening up Charlie's carefully sealed life. It's an abyss that Charlie teeters on each and every waking moment and one he has learned to navigate through sheer dint of denial.,1
You can't fix people. The hair is Sandler's chief prop to show he's deranged. And the use of music as an escape must hit home to every iPod - wielding subway rider. What we've got here is a Situation. Charlie's desperation makes us see Alan's.,1
"The movie has a sense of humor, and it is very sharp, but it is definitely a drama where it counts. The plot was easy enough to understand, I suppose. This guy's whole family died in 9 / 11, and he shuts the world out of his life. Alright. It was a very moving picture. After about the first 40 minutes, they aren't used anymore.",1
"Somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending. < br / > < br / > This rendition has the best overall Christmas atmosphere, hopeful and optimistic. However, I found Scrooge's nephew, Fred, a wee bit quiet & grim, not nearly as jolly & hearty as he should be. I adore his sideburns, his long topcoat & hat. Filmed in the town of Shrewsbury, England, it just seems somehow very British.",1
"He goes into completely denial and does his best to forget about his former life. This is an unwelcome surprise to Dr. Johnson since he is a married man with two children. The two begin to catch up, but Fineman believes Johnson was sent by people from his former life to persuade him into finding help. Slowly, but surely, Fineman regains his trust for Johnson. He is a self man ( dentist ) who helps start a dental practice.",1
Some people may never feel loneliness at this level. A very fine film. Jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and Sandler pulls tears.,1
"This film struck me as What's amazing about his role is that it's a character it's hard to say we've seen before. He is every man. < br / > < br / > Don Cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level. It's much more subtle than, say, Babel, and has a much more close - to - home ideal. He will make you weep, especially in his purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue.",1
"My first film from director Mike Binder,'Reign Over Me,'is an intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship. When Alan and Charlie meet for the first time in years, the latter doesn't even recognise an old friend, having completely abandoned any memories prior to his life - crippling experience.",1
He chances upon Charlie on the streets of Manhattan while driving from his job. There may be spoilers! Alan is stuck in a life that he knows is no longer fulfilling. place. He feels friendless and out of touch with his own reality. His landlady is his protector and great enabler. Charlie has gone back to a time in his life when he had no family.,1
My vote is seven. Alan reties his friendship with Charlie and they become close to each other.,1
"However, it is Sandler and Cheadle that give some of their finest work to date. He might even be typecast for characters with such hidden anger problems. Though Cheadle's character has more screen time than They completely owned this movie.",1
The feel of this movie was amazing. His character was really interesting.,1
"I took it very, very hard. My in - laws didn't get it! I had three small children, no education, no financial support.",1
< br / > < br / > This was first movie that has made me cry in a long time.,1
"Greetings again from the darkness. Not exactly a chipper upbeat film, but it is a quality film with an unusual story. How rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain. < br / > < br / > Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent.",1
< br / > < br / > This is a new career performance for Adam Sandler. Love hurts.,1
"< br / > < br / > This movie isn't funny like Borat or Billy Madison but it has a good pace about it. But I will say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. Don Cheadle was believable as always. I was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what I expected. I'd say 90 % of the audience laughed for most of the film. I saw this at a screening last night too. He was funny, and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies. Not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion.",1
"The soundtrack, which is almost another character in the plot is wonderful. This film screened last night at Austin's Paramount theater as part of the SXSW Film Festival. < br / > < br / > This is a breakout role for Adam Sandler. < br / > < br / > Reign over Me is one of the best major studio films to be released this year. He has the qualities of sincerity and honesty that comes through in this role.",1
Do yourself a favor and take time to see this movie. I feel there is no need to tell you anything more.,1
"It's very intense, and the closest I've come to crying in a movie in quite some time.",1
"For me, it is he best example of film noire since Chinatown.",1
"How on earth did the film gain the'U'certificate? ). A rather morbid tale one might think, but it is classic Charles Dickens, and also one of the most famous and popular Christmas stories of all time. Patrick Stewart He laughs too much. The two children represent Ignorance and Need ( although changed to Want in this film ).",1
"Before they leave however, Suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe. Very good!",1
"There are so many twists and turns in this film that I have a sore neck from watching. Dahl seems to bring out best in folks, and this will keep you interested, and guessing, until the very end.",1
Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better.,1
"James M. Cain would have appreciated it. John Dahl's film on the other hand, truly deserved to be described as such. The plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes. Movies such as Red Rock West give us hope for the future while paying tribute to past.",1
"After having been told what his mission is and been given a $ 5, 000 advance, he goes to see Suzanne and warns her about Wayne's plan. < br / > < br / > Michael decides to take the money he'd received from both parties and leave town. The same is true of the themes of murder, deceit, corruption and duplicity which are pervasive throughout.",1
"Go get this one, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",1
This is a'sleeper '.,1
"I'm sure he has his followers, though. A surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad.",1
Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous.,1
Hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy.,1
Little details add much to the enjoyment. Amazing how things have changed! ),1
"Mr D. Hopper is comfortably cast as the hired killer, like Mr Cage a USMC veteran. Red Rock West "" is a movie - lover's movie. Tempted as he might be to drive on, he takes the man to hospital, where it turns out he has been shot. Mr Cage decides to leave whilst he is still in front but as he is driving out of town he hits a man in the road.",1
"< br / > < br / > As fate would dictate, Michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy. < br / > < br / > The film was very well cast. He also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits. He is honest to a fault, but always on the dark side of fate. While leaving in a violent rainstorm, he runs down Suzannes lover.",1
Its a shame since the man had talent. But I feel he was miscast for this role. The role was not written keeping his personality in mind. There were too many close up frames. Dahl written the script with good duration of lenght. Hopper played his part well. Though I did not have much of an opinion in regards to last seduction. His facial expressions were on the mark.,1
"Even if the writing isn't particularly "" logical or credible "", the film has a nice way of intriguing viewer and just drawing them right in. Hopper, Boyle, and Walsh are all fun to watch in these parts. With really nothing else he can do, he decides that for once he's going to lie.",1
"Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good a film can be with practically no budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and loads of atmosphere. RRW delivers all these and more. She offers him double to kill Wayne.",1
"It's thrilling throughout, and you can't ask for much more than that! Overall, Red Rock West is a film that you're unlikely to regret watching. The plot focuses on the overly moral Michael ; a man travelling across America looking for work. It's not hard to see why Dahl chooses this sort of location, as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one.",1
"What a gift. < br / > < br / > Best quote? Also, it totally fit the story. Further, I've never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film. I'm sorry if I scared you. """,1
"Nicolas Cage is a thirdrate actor, the porcelain babe is a surrogate femme fatal, only daddy Hopper is as mean as ever. But this might be his regular look. < br / > < br / > Cage looks indeed rather groggy or dizzy or very confused and having a severe hangover.",1
"Well, you have to watch and see. Yes. < br / > < br / > Is the plot over the top? Does Cage stand a chance?",1
"The Horror, "" indeed! Because Scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie, it proves infectious. < br > < br / > Actually, I myself don't consider Scott's glib rage a liability. But other "" Christmas Carol "" purists might.",1
"Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. 8 pts. The first twist hits early on, and from there it's a nice neo - noir adventure some sleepy little town.",1
"The sets and the music contribute a great deal to almost every scene. They were right, it was some of the most fun I have ever had at the movies. < br / > < br / > The next afternoon, I followed their advice. But it's well worth it, for the fine craftwork that went into the first hour.",1
This is one of those movies.,1
"< br / > < br / > Boyle ( to Cage ) : "" You're not a killer? "". "" Red Rock West "" was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90's with a superb script ( by John and Rick Dahl ) that kept you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film. Cage : "" That's right, no.",1
"Cage is at his best. Not a slow minute in this film. A real sleeper. If you like plot turns, this is your movie.",1
"But with director as smart as Dahl, you shouldn't be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this film. An excellent movie. It isn't often that minor characters like deputy sheriffs have more brains than their headlining superiors.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film's screenplay contains plenty of surprises and plot twists. From this point of view, the coincidences are not script flaws at all. It's his final layover in a journey to... the twilight zone. Ordinarily, I would agree.",1
"You'll have fun watching this. At least in the "" deranged "" category, he's tough to beat. Not many. The movie has the right amount of action, suspense, plot twists and interesting characters.",1
It's always enjoyable. Cute symbolism.,1
"< br / > < br / > I will try anyway. The music is sweet. < br / > < br / > The reason this is my favorite Scrooge is because of EVERYthing. I couldn't disagree more. I think that is a HUGE part of what Dickens was trying to say. The joy he brings to Fred, to his wife are so apparent. One of my favorites is the narrator & nephew, played by Roger Rees. David Warner is also a totally believable Bob Cratchit. And after all, we are none of us past hoping. Some have said his portrayal too gruff. The supporting cast is very well done. < br / > < br / > Bravi tutti!",1
But both the CD and DVD will stay in our library as the best Christmas entertainment ever.,1
"It's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree. Poor Guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it glows like a neon sign. < br / > < br / > He's a persistent cuss and he does succeed.",1
"< br / > < br / > Everybody should see this movie, and someday, somehow, some worthy filmmaker his supporters should make another like it. < br / > < br / > It's wonderful.",1
"Needless to say, the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic. ( Those Brits... always the stiff upper lip when under fire. ) Remember the car that runs on water? I saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years.",1
"< br / > < br / > In fact, the comedy isn't entirely overt. < br / > < br / > 7.",1
"They thought actors got in the way of things. "" bemoans Stratton's landlady near the close. "" < br / > < br / > "" What's to become of my bit of washing when there's no washing to do? "" Certainly, he cares only about his work, its realisation - and sod the consequences.",1
How can Sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity? It's a good look at overall absurdity of the business world.,1
"< br / > < br / > Still, this is a great film. And if nothing else, the manufacturer would make fortune providing indestructible material for military uniforms ( especially BDUs ). This was my first exposure to the "" young "" Alec Guinness, and it's obvious from the first frames what made him so special as to eventually receive a knighthood. If you get a chance to see it on a classic movie channel, you should.",1
"After numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth - shattering explosions, Sidney eventually unveils his amazing creation : an almost - luminous white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out. Such well - known titles include'Whisky Galore! Ealing Studios, a television and film production company based in West London, claims to be the oldest film studio in the world. < br / > < br / > Sidney Stratton is poor and unappreciated, but he has scientific talent in great abundance. < br / > < br / > If Sidney thought that his invention would make him a hero, then he was sorely disappointed.",1
"After bluffing his way into Birnley's textile mill, he uses their laboratory to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not only never wears out, but also never needs to be cleaned!. The sound and setting is tremendous, the direction is seamless, with the tonal shift adroitly handled by Mackendrick. The decade the film was made is a crucial point to note, the making of nuclear weapons became more than just hearsay, science was advancing to frighteningly new proportions. Often tagged as a comedy, The Man In The White Suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and there.",1
Thesiger is amusing as a patriarch of the fabric industry.,1
This film version portrays all of that quite beautifully. It still looks the same now. Scott's is big and imposing. < br / > < br / > I love this movie.,1
"Maybe it was because, as an engineer, I identified with the protagonist. But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. I enjoyed this film.",1
"Rating, 8.",1
There was something magical and useful in Science. I don't think she was as impressed as I was! I took a girl - friend along to see it a second time.,1
"The script itself is full of dry wit - "" Is he all right? "" This film is no exception. Yes. "" - and characterisation is first rate. It's comical British understatement at its finest. Alec Guinness gives a fantastically understated performance, with eyes that convey wonder, joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it. I'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well.",1
< br / > < br / > Guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company.,1
"Excuse me, "" he says quietly, taking a step forward. Two men block his way. "" Ceilings fall down. Cut. ( This is what was known as British understatement. ) Guiness dashes out the open door. The blasts continue.",1
"Greenwood has discovered what Guinness is working on, and convinces Parker to continue the experiments ( but now legally ). < br / > < br / > Guinness has support from a female shop steward, but not her chief. But when he explains to them what he's done, they turn against him. He sees Guinness as selling out to the rich. They seek to suppress the invention. < br / > < br / > In the end, Guinness is defeated by science as well as greed.",1
"A thoroughly satisfying film, with Guinness and Greenwood magnificent. The complexities of the relationships between science, business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined. This time, he merely plays one character rather than eight, but as the unworldly inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton, he always finds the correct tone and expression. Of the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger do stand out.",1
Ernest Thesigner is very notable as a heavy. The political machinations actually carry the story.,1
How can someone be remembered as both Patton and Scrooge? I have now purchased the DVD and plan to watch it every year. Scott does so easily.,1
"The plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks. < br / > < br / > Like a lot Ealing comedies, this one stars Sir Alec Guinness. Of course, this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles. < br / > < br / > The Man in the White Suit is an intelligent, thought - provoking and witty comedy with a moral. I recommend this movie, basically, to anyone that is a fan of movies.",1
"She is sick and tired of money and power. The funny thing is that it'not even romance. He's never really intimidated by people. Contains * spoilers * - also, my quotes may not be exact. Does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal must've caused? It's more admiration, and perhaps even inspiration. Remember, < br / > < br / > "" But Sidney, we want to stop it too. "" No. < br / > < br / > Also notable is Dapne's role.",1
"Suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naively idealistic Sidney Stratton in pursuing his polymer vision make for a comedic delight. < br / > < br / > "" Knudsen!!!!!!! """,1
"The complex interplay of vested ( should that be suited? ) Hmmm. < br / > < br / > Of course, being Ealing, it's a comedy, but it needn't have been. And of what other film can it be said that the hero literally wears the plot?",1
"hm replaydvd. co. uk / joking _ apart _ S1. < br / > < br / > http : / / www. Very, very frustrating.",1
Moffat is a genius. Please! I need to laugh and laugh again! America must know this series.,1
"While your jaw is dropped during a "" Terminator "" movie, are you really sacred? It gave Chinatown "" should teach us that lesson. Venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun? I know lots of "" hillbillies "" - they are moral people, when left to themselves. His acting in "" Deliverance "" was superb.",1
One of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from Atlanta. In very bad ways. The photography is excellent as well.,1
It is definitely worth watching. This movie is a masterpiece.,1
We see it in the bow fishing.,1
10 / 10.,1
< br / > < br / > Deliverance : 9 / 10.,1
"Not sort of movie you could watch every week but it has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed. Each of the travelers is outstanding, although Voight gives the lead and strongest performance.",1
I can't believe I thought this film was boring! I certainly did. Just don't expect picnic.,1
"Look out for a very young Charley Boorman as Ed's son. The location was really chosen well. None really, in fact. The soundtrack is particularly noteworthy. I did like it but for fans of gore, there isn't really much of it. It was Voight himself.",1
"'I had seen two films at the Dome prior to this : "" Grand Prix "" and "" The Song of Norway. "" Well this wasn't exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. It's all up to you, Ed? "" The sound quality is second to none, from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks. The photography, cinematography... all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate. I don't blame my father for taking me, but it was a bit much for a child to witness. < br / > < br / > Watching it today, thirty - six years later, it still gives me quivers. After leaving the theater, I was shell - shocked. I was but fourteen years old. I wasn't even entirely sure what I was seeing, but I will never forgot it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty.",1
"I say, proudly, that I am a fan of movies that disturb, not just horror movies, but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding. Renyolds'character is an experienced adventurer, sort of no nonsense, and filled with machismo.",1
"It's an all - time classic. And what of Lewis, our intrepid guide? Movies that make you think. This is one well - acted movie. The story feels real. It's true. He really doesn't "" know nothing '. "" This is one deep movie.",1
"I give it eight out of ten stars, extremely impressed. I really was amazed at Director Boorman'vision of Dickey's novel, very impressed. You cannot go your whole life without watching this film.",1
"< br / > < br / > 8 out of 10, kids. It's awesome.",1
I have never gotten so immersed in a film as I have this one.,1
"Under great emotional stress, the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area. Lewis and Drew arrive unseen and Lewis, being a fair archer, kills rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest. Though it is not a horror movie, it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film. 9 % of the world's population.",1
Not many films can make you feel this creeped out. Bottom Line : This movie is a classic. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. I can't really say much more than that.,1
"< br / > < br / > This is the kind of thing that we see in Deliverance that sets up so much of the tension that is to follow. When the boy turns away from Drew, who had offered to shake his hand after their stupendous jam session, Bobby tells him to give the kid a couple bucks, knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react. This is not a Hollywood film.",1

This one was easily the class of group. That says a lot.,1
Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. < br / > < br / > Just unbelievable. < br / > < br / > The acting is mostly good. Voight is just OK in the lead - - he's been better.,1
"What can morality drive us to do, or not do, some cases? This was, undoubtedly, the most disturbing movie that I have ever seen. But that is misleading beyond belief. Lewis's leg made me wince.",1
"I think Beatty's traumatic shock afterward was well done. How expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done. It was confusing when Ed killed the other guy later, at the top of the cliff. The river trip never left you bored, for sure. Some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal.",1
"Fred Holywell, Scrooge's nephew, is an excellent example of this. < br / > < br / > What makes this version really stand out is the somber gravitas that the cast bring to their respective roles. Scott has made Scrooge utterly believable and painfully human. He wisely did not attempt a British accent, instead delivering his lines in that famous gravelly voice. As he is forced to review his life, we see him alternately softening, and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy.",1
"Often known for its "" SQUEAL! "" sequence ) by two vicious mountain men ( Bill McKinney, Herbert "" Cowboy "" Coward ). A must - see film for those willing to take a chance.",1
"After having seen Deliverance, movies like Pulp Fiction don't seem so extreme. < br / > < br / > The acting is universally excellent. In that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible.",1
Especially Jon Voight. All actors deliver ( haha ) perfect acting performances. !,1
"And that is another strength of the film. Direction and editing are flawless. < br / > < br / > Another strength is the film's theme. And the acting is terrific. As much as anything else, it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing. Dialogue is interesting.",1
"The film has aged well. There are no demons or bogeymen here. They shock because their evil is petty and tangible. The conflict and violence within movie seems to erupt out of nowhere, with a frightening lack of logic. The predatory hillbillies - as the film's central villains - are merely crude, terrifyingly amoral cousins of our protagonists.",1
"The movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been better. Although so much of it is excellent of itself, Deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of.",1
"< br / > < br / > When Dan plays guitar and sings at the Talent Show.... his voice cracking slightly as he reprises the song.... absolute gem! The look she gives him when he repeats her comment, about not liking Ruthie - sheer Green - Eyed Monster! And how surprised was I! You just really begin to feel for him. I just wish I had purchased it earlier. This sequence is one of the most well - crafted as Dan starts to loosen up with regard to Marie. Triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor!",1
"Put aside any prejudices because this is a must see! At the same time, the theme is entirely adult. The rosier makes way for the tragic which then gives over to idyllic which turns to the darker etc. This is a sublime piece of film - making. The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear. < br / > < br / >'Dan In Real Life'lacks nothing for being without the regular vices. It flows at just the right pace throughout.",1
"It is a good movie, watch it. < br / > < br / > There is a widowed guy ( Dan ), there is a girl ( Marie ). Marie is the girlfriend of his brother. And every other stuff is done well.",1
The immortal Charles Dicken's story has been recreated in every possible way imagine. Scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to Scrooge. I believe that if Dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it. It's not spectacular scenery per se but it's real. I could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery.,1

"< br / > < br / > Dan real life : * * * / * * * * I don't know any family who is like that. While there, he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman. Not that the movie is laugh out loud funny it's just that it has a big heart. No.",1
He should win an Oscar for his performance. I loved it. Clean family oriented movie.,1
"The Burns family is simply a close, loving group of people who are truly interested in best for Dan. I loved "" Dan in Real Life "". And thus begins a roller - coaster of restrained longing and funny love - budding. There are wonderfully awkward family moments that aren't unrealistic.",1
"My vote is eight. Along the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to take a decision. Follow the advice of Dan's column and plan to be surprised with the reunion of the Burns'family. < br / > < br / > "" Dan in Real Life "" is a great surprise and a delightful movie, with comedy, romance and drama.",1
"Still a fun movie. The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found. Sure the movie had some comedy, but it felt much more of a light Drama to me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance. Steve Carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices, family and pressure.",1
"< br / > < br / > The only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture. She proves she is right up to doing comedy, convincing us about her Marie. After his wife's death, he has taken time to raise his daughters. After all, she is the date of Dan's brother, Mitch. They just serve as incidental music for decoration. Mr. Carell, in fact, keeps getting better all the time.",1
DAN IN REAL LIFE delivered that promise.,1
"My problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development, mostly with Dane Cook's character. I ended up enjoying it quite a bit.",1
"There is a scene in Dan in Real Life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first. Dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life, yet he comes to realize that things aren't so picture perfect in his own. Just "" put it on my tab. "" This is exactly the case for Dan Burns ( Steve Carell, the Office ) a columnist for the local newspaper. The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's Law : anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

Still love and happiness radiate their home, no thanks to the guy Bob Cratchit works for. The characters in this film are middle and lower class.",1
"Its a story thats been told before, but not like this.",1
"make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love. Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girls. < br / > < br / > What's a man to do? If you cannot accept it, fear not, "" Get Smart "" will be along later in the year, but for the record I thought he was very good. At a large family homecoming Dan meets his perfect woman, only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother.",1
"Between that and focusing on his career, finding love again was not one of Dan's priorities. And so he became more functional than feeling. I'm Dan. His entire Sound familiar? She is already seeing someone. After that tragedy, Dan was left to raise their three daughters alone. There is only one problem really.",1
It was a wonderful break from sex jokes and nudity of recent films.,1
< br / > < br / > Don't miss this one. It's not the typical romantic comedy.,1

"And it happened! For Romance's sake, as a married man. < br / > < br / > 1.",1
Her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved.,1
"The story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up. In that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint. The characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors. < br / > < br / > I only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better. < br / > < br / > It's a quite intriguing dramatic story, with also romance present in it.",1

First rate!,1
"The film, visually as well as plot - wise, is razor - sharp. The atmosphere and characters are all utterly believable, and Verneuil left nothing to chance in its tight plotting.",1
Viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choice. This is simply one of the finest renditions of Dicken's classic tale.,1
"Compared to JFK this movie is more reasonable, intelligent and thrilling. Its unique and brilliant, and the music by Ennio Morricone is wonderful.",1
10 out of 10. Such film could be made only in 1970 - ies but it will never lose it's actuality.,1
"This film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons. The co - ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments. "". A film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so.",1
"White Fire has so much going for it. The charisma he has in this makes Tom Selleck look like a putz. Now, if I can just get my hands on that soundtrack.",1
"The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, particularly the villains, one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish - mash of Spanish and Italian. Williamson is better than usual, clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee ( and he doesn't come in until midway through ). She's priceless. It's a rollicking - if mind - numbingly stupid - action classic. I generally don't watch movies knowing that they're going to be bad, but I made an exception for this one... and I was very glad that I did. He claimed it's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made.",1
"Well, Bo does that to his sister and, judging by her dubbed laughter, she doesn't mind at all. Sick, dude! Superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80's exploitation, hooray!",1

). This film is a rhapsody.,1
"With maximum dignity, the Colonel rejects Nogales'offer, picks up his fighting rooster and walks away as nobly as his old legs can carry him. The Colonel waits as the only the government that he fought to establish to recognize his loyalty with a promised and much needed pension. In response to her continued question, "" What are we going to eat until November ( when the cockfighting season begins ) "", Colonel responds, "" Shit. "" Once he is at home, Dona Lola, his scolding wife, wants to know why the Colonel refused the money when both of them are starving.",1
"My vote is eight. Lola still grieves the death of their son Augustin some time ago. In Brazil, most of the retired persons has to survive with about US $ 80, 00 per month.",1
"Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. They're perfect team.",1
His Scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie. Then his character changes to one who is truly repentant.,1
Mr. Hall's work is truly superlative.,1
"It tells us about another notorious hit - man, Michael ( Mike ) Salliwan. Such stories never have happy end after all.",1
"I especially, liked the way it ended. < br / > < br / > Some have complained about Hanks as a gangster. I believe that isn't justified.",1
A great gangster film. He is an acting legend.,1
Definitely Jude Law's best performance. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.,1
"< br / > < br / > Mafia doesn't rules, in Mafia nobody wins, when they want you out, they take you out. < br / > < br / > This movie receives : 10 / 10 One of my favorite movies, with a very nostalgic ending.",1
"Tom Hanks like you've never seen him before. Make room for some Oscars! Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "" The Angel of Death "".",1
( It is violent though. ),1
"Tyler Hoechlin does a terrific job as Michael Jr. In Road to Perdition, his character Michael Sullivanis a little bit different. This movie is a sleeper film that should be watched for years to come. With his wife and child dead, Sullivan takes to the road to find answers. He feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother.",1
"Regardless, this is a terrific Christmas classic. The spirits are all effective, each one creepier than the last. And what a supporting cast!",1
This is a beautiful film. He usually has the nice guy roles.,1
"So sit back, and enjoy the wild ride. So he wacks out the son and wife of Michael Sr., except Michael Jr. < br / > < br / > The movie will have you feeling the old days. And he did in high fashion.",1
He is truly a legend. Paul Newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen. I loved this film!,1
which recreates the 30's with stunning effect. It's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances. He is also a professional hit - man to mob boss John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons.,1
"I've never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role, probably better. ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newman's score.",1
"Rooney is tied by blood to his own son, but tied by love and loyalty to Michael. But this movie is indeed different. The Road to Perdition, directed by Sam Mendes ( American Beauty ), is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time.",1
This is the best mob film ever made. It was nominated but didn't win.,1
"Frankly, this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors. < br / > < br / > Sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price, even at the terribly high price of perdition. The movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father - son relationship. < br / > < br / > I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan, but he does step out of character to play hit - man Sullivan convincingly, giving a subtle and laconic performance. But Rooney's son Connor is even more evil than the rest. When Connor learns that Sullivan's son Michael witnessed it, he mistakenly kills Sullivan's other son ( and Sullivan's wife ) in an attempt to silence witnesses. As the movie ends, somewhat predictably, one character is saved and one character repents. Jude Law plays Maguire in suitably creepy way.",1
The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain. This is one of the best made movies from 2002.,1
"But hey, this is George C. Scott. 19th Century London comes to life in Clive Donner's visionary style. Bah! Scott is properly gruff as Scrooge. The important tale of morality shines through in every frame, though.",1
"Huh? He did himself proud as this is one of the best - looking crime films you'll ever see. His work is just awesome. Conrad Hall went out with a bang. The amount of action in here is just right, too : not too much ; not too little.",1
"Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for his work here. As with American BEAUTY, there is a cold, distancing feel to this movie, despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love, loyalty and betrayal.",1
"He loved it - and the discussion. ) < br / > < br / > The plot is simple, but the story is complex.",1
"Mike Sullivan had no father as a child, so John Rooney took him in. Young Tyler Hoechlin drives an emotional wheel ; playing the basis character for the story. The shot starts at the front of the car, revealing Mike ( Hanks ) through the windshield. This is some of the best cinematography I've seen ; and I watch a lot of films. The scene when Mike and Michael are in the car, entering Chicago is quite impressive. Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career. This couldn't have been better.",1
"But it doesn't stop there. He was incredible! His work on this movie made it what it is. Paul Newman, good as always. The screen Writing is worthy of an Oscar. Conrad Hall is a true genius.",1
"< br / > < br / > My grade 10 out of 10 This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad. They are shown so deeply, strong and believable.",1
There is an internal logic rare in these films. is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying. In the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected.,1
"< br / > < br / > GREAT! I just wish i came across this earlier then i did! But like i said of an acquired taste, so don't be surprised if you don't like the film.",1
So what if it's not all original? Fight scenes!! Great Music!! The truth is America as a whole is not prepared for Meatball Machine. Humans become flesh eating cyborgs!!!,1
"< br / > < br / > Also notable are the little aliens, who I found cute. All in all, it's a good film for fans of the genre.",1
"George C. Scott was born to be Scrooge, just as he was born to be Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century.",1
Is there a way to stop the transformation? Only one way to find out. This was a very entertaining flick.,1
"Wow baby, this is indeed some fine Asian horror / gore, and a crazy outlandish movie. The movie also borrows a little from Carpenter's "" The Thing "" in creature design and effects. hmmm, yum yum.",1
"Don't be fooled by the silly title folks, this is one sweet ride! Find it and watch, you won't be disappointed! That's mostly it for plot, but who cares when the gore is this good? The winner of the battle eats the loser alive.",1
"There are definitely some thematic parallels, though the films are definitely different.",1
"called "" Necroborg "" ( very original ) is caused by slimy little aliens. I don't know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of "" Tetsuo "" or not. Why "" Tetsuo ""? < br / > < br / > 7 out of 10.",1
"I'm happy. First of what is "" Meatball Machine ""? Boy finally meets girl. Will he succeed? Who gives a damn, as long as there is carnage and death I'm satisfied. Acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film. I doubt I'll ever get a chance to see the original so I'll just stick commenting on this one. It's not exactly painful for the ears but it's not exactly good either. The necroborgs as they are called in "" Meatball Machine "" look stunningly detailed. A simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore. And yes it too luckily shows more violence.",1
We are happy to see such enthusiastic young cast. But they all did a good job.,1
Great job from Gokbakar brothers. And also transition parts are really excellent.,1
"He tells the story with precision and an eye to detail, and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative, especially Scott. This 1984 version of the Dickens'classic ` A Christmas Carol,'directed by Clive Donner, stars George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. It's a study in perfection. And what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor ; to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous.",1
The atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark.,1
"The mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good. Scenario and acting is quite good. I must say, I was surprised with the quality of the movie. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought. It was far better than I expected.",1
A real classic.,1
"And, who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out? Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best high - spirited comedies I have ever seen.",1
This is a fast paced comedy. It is not on VHS or DVD.,1
"was duly aired, and I - - swayed by the opening few seconds of the film - - popped in a blank tape. Should this gem ever find its way to a DVD release, I'll be at the front of line. Best thing I ever did.",1
I love this anime!,1
"< br / > < br / > If not for the terribly funny aspect to it, it would be, just another anime. < br / > < br / > this show, however, i would recommend to anyone. I'm ready to ASSURE you that you will enjoy it.",1
"Another thing is the characters. And 16 year old Ranma, the spring of drowned girl. Wow... We all know this famous story. What I like about it is the humor.",1
"It's a very crafty fun loving story. admittedly, I first picked up Ranma 1 / 2 when I was around twelve. Then, I went to the Comic / Manga section and spotted this book. I don't know how I did it... but I couldn't stop. For Genma, that was a PANDA, and for Ranma that was a... girl! Eventually, after about two days, I grew obsessed. I even took it home for a few more reads over. Frankly, I wasn't getting anywhere. INTENSE martial artists.",1
"''Ranma ½ "" is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi.",1
"On opposite sides of the law, we see within each character not the black and white, but the shades of grey. There are many interesting moments of moral questioning, on how anti - hero, despicable strategies are adopted. So begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of Hong Kong.",1
There are tons of violent actions but has a good story to it. !,1
This has got to be the best movie I've ever seen. It's a must - watch. < br / > < br / > I rate this film 10 / 10.,1
"Despite being filthy from his journey, he's almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant. Dog Bite Dog isn't going to be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister. It acted as my cue to suspend disbelief, and I had a lot more fun for it.",1
"It's visually arresting and the sound design is very unique. Ultra - grim crime drama from Pou - Soi Cheang, the director of "" Home Sweet Home "".",1
Wai's chief is his dad's friend and is worried about Wai's erratic behavior. Knives to neck and torso. And several very intense beatings. Wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting Pang but Pang is almost unstoppable.,1
"However, it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch, particularly if gritty, hard - edged action is your thing. Eventually, after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas, a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on ( a now dead ) Yue, delivering their baby moments before he himself dies. Stabbings, shootings, merciless beatings : all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheang.",1
"Great movie, highly recommended. Along the way, the hit - man in trying to hide in a dump, finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man. 3 Hong Kong movies kind of disappeared. He eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy, before he escapes back to Cambodia. I knew it was a rough crime drama going in, but being the first Cat.",1
Ever wondered how the real police work is like?,1
"This is one of my least favorite things about the genre. The police characters also defied my expectations thoroughly. It says a lot about the reason these guys are the way they are, rather than simply condemning them. I ended up getting something entirely different, which is not at all a bad thing.",1
"The hunt is on, and a cat - and - mouse game between the police and the "" mad dog "" ( as the police refer to him ) ensues. Did this film live up to my expectations?",1
Which brings us to the film's one weakness.,1
"One is about love, and the other is about redemption. Much like Salo, this one shows us the dehumanization of the human spirit. Sam Lee as the obsessed cop is also outstanding. He is ruthless, vile and beyond likable. Is violence really that necessary? However, as many have pointed out, this is not a movie for everyone. WOW. It is a topic that the director brilliantly explores, without limiting himself at all. The music is also worth mentioning.",1
Makes you think about what is life about really.,1
"He knows no restrictions, has no mercy and barely speaks a word. Pang, the hit - man, is a Cambodian orphan and has been trained to fight & kill for money ever since he was a child. From then on begins a thrilling and action - packed cat and mouse game between the frustrated cop and the professional killer.",1
Chilling performance by Edison Chen. This is an action - melodrama like the world has never seen it before.,1
"Finally we have before us a Category III movie for the summer 2006 season. < br / > < br / > Although weaned from childhood to become a professional killer, Edison The soundtrack boosts this atmospheric effect, adding to the overall unreal mood the film purveys. Dog Bite Dog retains numerous traits recalled from that horror project, namely rundown urbanscapes and a pervasive air of something eerie lurking round the corner.",1

Unlike his usual works this one isn't put out of place and out of time. Unlike all other Hamilton's movies the age of female varies. Unlike other movies main character is a boy.,1
but it is.,1
"Guys will think "" Lucky Julien! "" You either see it or miss it and there's no time to observe, to comprehend. Women, too, may have similar thoughts, but all such considerations must be pushed out of one's conscious mind. even as they agree that sex and children in movies is a "" bad thing, "" all the while still wishing they could have been a Julien at that age. In one book were seen a few pictures of a young boy, obviously nude, intimate with a young woman older than he, also nude. Hysterically, the worst assumptions have become automatic and matters of children and sex are rigorously avoided. < br / > < br / > The art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography. Someone else liked them, too, because my David Hamilton books were stolen. Though discrete, there was strong sexual connotation.",1
One cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness. This movie documents the Harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties.,1
"But trust me, It is a lot better than Paris is Burning, because its a 2005 make. I joined the House of Theieves. My book, Identity Schemes is available on sale at Amazon dot com or at Identity Schemes dot com.",1

Wonderfully put together..,1
It is well made and very powerful.,1
"I could go on, but I think you get the point by now : I love this movie! Fifteen years later and Paris Is Burning is still aflame.",1
How wrong I was about this movie.,1
The words and wit were just as sharp as moves on the floor. No Madonna did not come up with the idea of Voguing but this is where she got it from! PLEASE RELEASE ON DVD for the world to see!!! Thank You!,1
Wow!,1
"? < br / > < br / > Sounds depressing but it's not. The balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here. Homophobia and racism all together. There they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted. Where's the DVD?? And what DID happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown? That's kind of sad. Also drag has become more "" accepted "" in society ( for better or worse ).",1
"An excellent documentry. This is a good pre "" homo thug "" movie. When Queens were really proud to be extroverts. I personally remember this growing up in NYC in the early 80's. That time is gone forever.",1
"It is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989. Anthony Slide's'Great Pretenders'says nothing. The major film performance by a house member prior to 1990 seems to be Chrystal La Beija in "" The Queen "", 1968.",1
It's real life. And of course New York City in the 80's.,1

There are shots in this movie of nude transsexuals. Some of these dreams are so unattainable it's tragic.,1
It is about friendship. ! This is why God created cinema! See this movie!,1
"He is confined to a wheelchair, and needs round - the - clock attention. Darius Goes West is an amazing roller - coaster of a story.",1
What a ride! And what a trip to finally get to know Darius Weems!,1
It's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil. Not one to relax you. I am not sure why. No attempt is made to glamorise the police. There is not much feeling of optimism in it. Anne has her own way of patching things up. Let's face it. This is the world we live in.,1
"The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and has never left. They make no money from sales of the $ 20 dvds.",1
"It is snowballing out of control. It played twice over the course of the festival. Please go see this movie! It is in the Tribeca Film Festival, and it is going to London and Athens, Greece.",1

"People in the theater were sobbing. I have one word to someup this movie, WOW!",1
He receives help and encouragement from a group of young men who love and care for him while going on this quest.,1
It hit the exact spot of what Bulimia is really about and how it's not always about being skinny and dieting. This was the best movie I've ever seen about Bulimia. It has to do with them and them only. That line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem.,1
"And if we don't sympathise with people suffering from the depths of despair, then we are dead inside. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair. This film is really an astonishing achievement, and director Katt Shea should be proud of. Together, they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with one another. The only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people.",1
"This was a pretty good movie, I liked it. to her mother.",1
I couldn't really discern plot.,1

"She's great. < br / > < br / > Okay, so I liked those bits. It was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and even she didn't see the signs. This was surprisingly intelligent for a TV movie, and quite true to my own experience of bulimia.",1
Its a small world and this little movie shows us.,1
"Perhaps with more movies of Bug's quality, people will start to take notice. And it works. < br / > < br / > This movie is pure magic.",1
I'll be watching for next one. I gave it a 10.,1
"< br / > < br / > "" Bug "" entertains on much the same level as "" trains, planes and automobiles "" but on a lower budget and with a fresher eye.",1
"He attempts to woo her every chance he gets and he certainly makes attempts! Taking that risk was a good idea because it's end result is an exceedingly good film. < br / > < Gordon - ( Grant Heslov ) is a man whose life isn't going very well, as bad things begin to add up in his life he decides to take it in hand.",1
I will be looking for more good things from this producer the future.,1
"There is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in "" The Great Yokai War "" than one would find in a Disney movie. However, I ' There was a TV commercial in Japan couple years before this movie came out. Hint : this would not happen in a Disney film. The only reason I'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played Tadashi's tormentors were not up to the job.",1
"why? and there are many actors which you will recognize. This movie has a lot of laughs, Lots!",1
This movie is just wonderful. Quite by accident actually.,1
"One thing that was great about this was the use of real European locations. Oh well. Overall, twasn't really a bad movie. Hmmmm, want a little romance with your mystery? Not good.",1
< br / > < br > They need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at. < br / > < br / > He also starred in a number of TV movies and is now making a TV Mini series. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane.,1
I enjoyed this movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > Bottom line is, I liked it very much. I liked especially Lexa Doig's acting. It's up to viewer to decide - and I don't like such endings. Warning!",1
I also recommend all of the Ghost Series.,1
"What worked exceptionally well was the middle portion. One of the team's better films and it almost earns a 9. Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy films have very, very little plot.",1
"After breaking an extension, Stan gets a replacement, a loaded gun, from off the wall, and of course it fires the brush off. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Ollie and Stan are the chimney sweeps that arrive to do their job, and very quickly Ollie wants to get away from Stan making mistakes. Stan goes up to have a look, and Ollie, standing on the attic door of the roof, falls into the greenhouse. Stan asks if he was hurt, and Ollie only answers with "" I have nothing to say. """,1
"The acting the characters, the story. His mum must be proud. Everything about it was superb. A child poked and bullied at school who becomes a hero.",1
< br / > < br / > Rating : 5 stars out of 5. < br > < br / > Dirty Work is Stan and Ollie at their funniest. Great fun.,1
A LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short.,1
"It's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless, so it works for the movie.",1
Guess what happens next? Also watch out for a scene featuring a fish.,1
"Meanwhile, Stan & Ollie are chimney sweeps who show up at the Professor's home the very day he perfects his solution. "" While I've never heard a fan cite DIRTY WORK as his or her favorite Laurel & Hardy comedy, it's nonetheless one that everybody seems to like.",1
"Also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him. Why? Then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end. < br / > < br / > We're not told. Rideau, on the other hand, is great.",1
Who hasn't go through this?,1
"So maybe things will go better for him in the future. We are left with him starting over and viewing, not participating, in happiness.",1
"Of coarse I bought it without seeing it and was glad I did. I feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice. I personally wasn't bothered by the CGI and prosthetics. '< br / > < br / > Good job Takashi Miike! The dark underlying morals are there, but, it's also as silly as any kids film should be. / 10 stars. < br / > < br / > Great Yokai War is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too.",1
in a way that is comlex & sympathetic.,1
The movie is very realistic. That is probably the moral of this story.,1
!,1
"you follow the entire year of these boys, from their meeting to the end. both leads are fantastic, as well as the entire cast. check it out!",1
It leaves you charmed with its beauty. The best part of this movie is the cinematography.,1
Why is Mathieu in a mental hospital? What led to the boys'break - up?,1
Deeply emotional.,1
; - ),1
"You, too, will want a sequel to find out.",1
"However, older children may well eat this up, that is, if you play it dubbed in English. One quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city... says one, "" Oh, it's only Gamera "". As for adults, there's not much here not to like, if you're a fan of Japanese monster movies you'll enjoy the heck out of this. < br / > < br / > Cool & fun stuff, kind of dark at times but perhaps that's just Miike.. and what a wild ride. "" 8 out of 10.",1
"In a land far from where he lives, Mathieu spends is days at the beach with his sister. The sex is not avoided nor exploited, it is treated as it is, with no exhibitionist intention. The first love, in its terrible progression ecstasy - despair. It is well worthy being seen, especially by those who adore French movies ( although I was searching for similar movies, in the come of age line.",1
"< br / > < br / > Spoiler of sorts follows. This was a polished, very professionally made motion picture. Though many scenes seem superfluous I rate it nine out of ten.",1
Why? But isn't that what life is like? Many also dislike its confusing structure and lack of clear explanations. My appreciation of this movie increases. Pay attention to the hair style and you can easily separate out 2 of the 3 periods.,1
"As the summer warms on, they fall in love and, when the holidays end, decide to live together. Beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could.",1
"By turns heart - breaking and uplifting, this film ranks with "" Beautiful Thing "" as must - see cinema. But stick it out : The film's final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you won't be able to take your eyes off screen. Soon, the two are falling in love.",1
"But it is better than many of you have said. He tries to suicide taking something, and Cedric brings him to hospital. Maybe "" Presque Rien "" is not the best movie ever made... But anyway, as I said before... this is not a funny movie.",1
"The youth Cédric ( Stéphane Rideau ) follows Mathieu and his sister home, continuing the mystery of attraction. We are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action.",1
"Mathieu appears to have learned his lesson, hard way. Mathieu feels the attraction for Cedric too. < br / > < br / > If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you would like to stop reading. The story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film. The film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended. We watch as Mathieu, reading from the guide book, wants Cedric's attention.",1
Worth a watch. Presque Rien'is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual.,1
"It has some beautiful cinematography, much as would be provided in a CGI film of the same decade. Viewed in the right mood or with right friends, it is exciting, moving & touching. The Yokai Monsters series is not the equal of Majin at its best, but the Yokai are nevertheless great fun. Yokai Monsters : Spook Warfare ( Yokai daisenso, 2005 ) a movie about "" yokai "" or traditional Japanese "" monsters "" of folklore. It is alternatively known as Big Monster War or as Ghosts on Parade.",1
"I disagree with other posters that say it's'too artsy. After I finished watching it, I felt the same. I love American films - probably because they are so narrative.",1
"It's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for Midler fans, it's a must.",1
Spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone. Bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads.,1
She possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity. Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you.,1
See this film.,1
I know them.,1
"This is unlike anything I've seen in the movie theater before. Doubtful. You will not be bored can guarantee that. And no, that wasn't just a marketing ploy.",1
I read the play before I saw the movie and loved them both. Terrible shame to have lost him so young.,1

"Firstly, it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. < br / > < br / > In case you're wondering, Paulie is a parrot. as a musical immigrant.",1
"That's normal for him, it seems. Roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them. Watch movie and that will make sense. Tony Shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans. What's not to like? The only surprise to me was finding that Jay was also Paulie's voice. I will, however, admit that a happy moment colors my review of "" Paulie. "" However, the IMDb voter leans to the geeky, and "" Paulie "" doesn't qualify for that. ( "" I'm Russian...",1
"It's a touching reunion. That part might bother younger children. What should be Paulie's advantage is actually a dis - advantage in ways. ( END ) < br / > < br / > Happy to say, it was better than that.",1
The movie was so inspiring to me. The movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named Paulie. Love overcame all obstacles.,1
The movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level. I recommend this movie to anyone any age.,1
Made me wish my own happy birds could talk. Paulie is a lovable little treasure.,1
This one is just fabulous. I gave it 10 out of 10.,1
"And through all of these comparisons, and even through the flaws or over - reaching moments, it's Miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters. Or to anime like Samurai 7.",1
Beautiful photography throughout.,1
"That's when the adventure begins. Will he find his long lost Marie or not? Paulie is given to the little girl Marie, as a present. It'll touch your heart. It was SO good! I absolutely LOVED this movie! When I first watched this movie, it made me cry.",1
"Rent this for the whole family, everyone will enjoy this. Spoiler This is a great film about a conure. This film also has some sad parts that make tears run.",1
"I just couldn't stop my tears, even though film has a happy end.",1
< br / > < br / > The parrot is definitely the star of the film. Paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory. A sentimental story with a sentimental sound track. It's about a little girl ( with a voice impediment ) who treasures her green parrot Paulie.,1
9 / 10 The animal training is well - done - everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time. Not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion.,1
"And they finally did after Marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly. Of cage that is! The two of them became birds of a feather ( OK, bad pun! ). And not a few phrases either. But I found the film a pleasant surprise.",1
"Don't miss it! Well, think again.",1
"However, the villain here, is not a mere demon, it is the demon - spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans "" use "" and "" discard "". A lot people get hung up on this films tag as a "" children's film "", and that it certainly is, though it is one made for adults. Takashi Miike uses the fantasy genre, particularly, the children's fantasy genre, as a springboard into the wild territory that is the Great Yokai War.",1
"< br / > < br / > Oh yes, Paulie had a plot. Pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie, with the whole family. The plot held thick and entertaining throughout, keeping me attracted. Ever.",1
"I was entranced by this touching and hilarious film, not to mention surprised.",1
"Also starring Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado. I certainly recommend it. < br / > < br / > All in all, it's a very well done movie.",1
"High recommended. My aunt liked it, too.",1
"5 / 10, acting 7.",1
"He falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her. Then the great journey begins. < br / > < br / > so no BABE here, more of an incredible journey with a twist. < br / > < br / > Enjoy and try no to tear up during sad parts. This film is not about the secret life of ALL animals who secretly can talk.",1
"! It is a witty, funny yet emotional movie.",1
"Most of what I liked came from the technical side of things. It's actually one of my least favorite of the director's films. This has to be Miike's most expensive movie, and it looks fantastic. "" 1. Miike makes a children's adventure film, not unlike The Neverending Story.",1
There is also a few other songs not put on the CD. The show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show. I was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on DVD.,1
"Stars like Tony Shalhoub ( from Providence ) bring the tale to life. And, as a final remark, the puppetry is entirely believable. The story itself is inspiring. While she learns to speak correctly, so does Paulie. I would like to say that soundtrack is astounding.",1
"No visit to them is the same, and each time they offer us up with a surprise. This awareness has also meant The League of Gentlemen undergoes a bold evolution, not usually seen in a show of this nature. < br / > < br / > Up until it's arrival on the scene, there had never really been anything like The League of Gentlemen before.",1
That was only a few of the strange inhabitants. I would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wont regret it! The TV works consists of 3 series and a Christmas special.,1
"< br / > < br / > Fans of horror will love it, fans of comedy will love it. As any traveler It's that creepy. By themselves, the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters.",1
"So, on my own, I made the best out of it that I could. ( No offense, Matt & David.... Love you )! This is probably the best television show I've ever seen. LB has nothing on LoG! This is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius. I first saw it on Comedy Central several years ago.",1
"The film adaptation is best demonstration of this, but some fans may decide they belong local. The League of Gentlemen is one of the funniest, strangest, darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time. < br / > < br PLUMS!!!!!",1
This program is one of best I've seen. About a year ago I finally gave up on American television. It was then that I decided to switch to British television.,1
"! < br / > < br / > Well done BBC! Besides recognising some of the locations, I found myself not in the least bit surprised.",1
"Nonetheless, give it a try. < br / > < br / > The humour will not appeal to all.",1
"So don't over - analyze or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it. There is something about this movie I felt about TMNT that really made me love it. By the end of this movie you will feel good. It's a formula that is used a lot. < br / > < br / > Here's basically what this movie made me to. And I'm a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience. This is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies. Watch it as it is and you will enjoy it. It's very touching, the ending is original, and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to.",1
This is by far the funniest thing on TV.,1
"In particular, animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island ( from "" The Vicar of Dibley "" and "" Father Ted "" ) seem pretty normal! Funny and incredibly irreverent beyond belief - - you have to see it to believe. ! However, you really do need very thick skin and a love of the awful to enjoy this to the max.",1
Not for kids. Thought - provoking. The blackest comedy I can recall.,1
"That, my dears, is "" dark humor "". But.. a warning. Watch it in order. Bravo!",1
"< br / > < br / > I'm sure you've all seen The Matrix by now. The creators of The Matrix say that it is'anime inspired '. < br / > < br / > The film is sort of set in 1980s Japan, and it really shows. The 1980s.",1
But it's still cool. Not just animation style but several character designs. The bike mechs are cool and the story works for the most part.,1
< br / > < br / > never laughed half (! ) as much as from watching this masterpiece.,1
< br / > < br / > Other characters were well cast from Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson.,1
Kirsten Dunst is very much Kirsten Dunst ( again ) and you may like it ( as I do ) or find it annoying. Fox proved she is capable to play a hot starlet with her head in the clouds. They all fit their character well enough. Though I do think the ending is flawed.,1
"I might add, Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie.",1
"However, give it a chance. Some Well, older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non - Western themes and composition. So who is the audience in the West? In fact, you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time. < br / > < br / > I enjoyed this film, but boy was it a chore at first!",1
Enjoyed it. Don't miss this flick! Others are also pretty good. He's a Legend.,1
"Simon Pegg made an OK appearance, slightly worse than his usual.",1
"He is making a career out of lampooning celebrities, although he has a desperate wish to be a celebrity himself. < br / > < br / > He is at first thrilled to go work for a major publication ( called Sharp's Magazine in the movie ), and despite active nerves he is positively beaming on his first day. He meets the chief editor, Clayton Harding ( played by Jeff Bridges ), who is hard as nails but who is also exactly the kind of editor he needs to be for a goof - off like Young to keep his job at the magazine. He offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of Young, but he also has what can only be described as a liberal tolerance of Young's off - - wall antics and inappropriate behavior. < br / > < br / > Complicating matters are two very different women.",1
"I really, really enjoyed watching this movie! To impressions! This time it was larger than we expected. The saints of moment are the stars. We desperately need benchmarks in regard to which to measure ourselves. we need our stars!",1
"I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. the character of Young is full and reasonable. Therefore, her performance is not enduring in this film.",1
"But the rest of the film's acting was not worthy enough to feature here. "" Pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as Sidney Young. "" He is uproarious, daring, and moronic. How To Lose Friends & Alienate People "" is not based on Tiger Woods'infidelities.",1
Well it was a nice surprise after all. One does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again.,1
< br / > < br / > 7 out of 10 I liked the film. Of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications.,1
"Neither did How to lose friends and Alienate People. But in end he ends up doing them, the culture of life.",1
"Hmmm. It DOES get better, however. His role here, though, took a completely different turn. It was nice to see him in a role that I could actually enjoy. That's my impression of this film, anyway. Much like the Bean character Rowan Atkinmson plays. < br / > < br / > Overall then, I liked it!",1
"Wow! F'n rad, and one of Miike'best!",1
"This involves him selling out, and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity. The key word here is "" based "". However, they are not overdone : the main substance remains a comedy which centres around Sidney's misadventures. This girl will go far. This contradiction is never that much of an issue, because Simon Pegg ( as Sidney ) projects likability too well.",1
"To emphasize point there is a dog, and Pegg rounds that off in true Brit style comedy, with a great little twist. Young wants the down right dirty contrasted with the American professionalism. < br / > < br / > This 2008 picture works on account of its actors and the simple yet sharp story. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, reminds everyone she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype film star.",1
It's an absolutely hilarious film with a great cast. I know it's not a true story. One of Simon Pegg's best.,1
It's also a great title for helping to fill up the line requirement in IMDb reviews!,1
"I can't see any other actor in the role of Sidney, and I'm sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for Pegg's great performance.",1
"Romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe "" How to lose friends & alienate people "". Its one of these films where every little detail does pay tribute to a great piece of work. Yet it works so well, especially with Pegg in the front seat.",1
I Rate this film 81 %.,1
Highly recommended to all.,1
"Those who disagree please tell me where I can find some! Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real.",1
"Kirsten Dunst was good as the love interest. < br / > < br / > This was a good comedy & well worth checking out at the theaters. < br / > < br / > Along the way to success, he finds true meaning of love, etc. The rest of the supporting cast did its job well.",1
"Wow! F'n rad, and one of Miike'best!",1
"How to Lose Friends & Alienate People hit the spot! Of course not perfect, but very enjoyable and funny. He also upsets his direct boss Lawrence Maddox ( Danny Huston ). Simon Pegg is still hilarious as ever! How can you not like him?! Kirsten Dunst and Jeff Bridges were brilliant! Sidney finds creative ways to annoy nearly everyone.",1
"Pacing of the more visual humorous content was, I thought, spot on. I rapidly became absorbed in the unfolding of the narrative and remained engrossed throughout. ( Any apparent ruthless ambition displayed tended to be tempered by a corresponding good natured resilience. )",1
"In 2000 alone, Argentina released many quality films, which broke Argentine B. O. records. If this film plays at festival near you, or on video, don't miss it!",1
"He takes to the streets trying to make ends meet. Elsa, while surprised, wants to do the right thing. It's almost a miracle he gets the job. Watching it for a second time, we found a different meaning in this look at life in Buenos Aires. Things go from bad to worse, when Ariel's mother dies suddenly. Although we liked it, we didn't think it was extraordinary.",1
"The ending scenes from Puccini's Turandot alone are worth the time to get there. "" Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other. It's not my favorite movie but it is a movie I have enjoyed seeing more than once. Some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy Pavarotti, they would likely be better served by picking up an opera DVD. Yes, Georgio "" is a light - hearted and enjoyable movie / comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music.",1
"As someone else commented, this is a feel - good movie. Just enjoy!",1
"I'm Italian. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and voice is what it's all about. ). this is a god - awful movie. You may be pleasantly surprised, as a Luciano lover or prospective Pavarotti peep.",1
And hearing the duet of Santa Lucia gorgeous. What's not to like about this film?,1
com and have a look before it'sold out.,1
I even bought several of his CD's. ! He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. He will definitely be missed!!,1
"The film is a compilation of'80s kid's films conventions. < br / > < br / > One of the IMDb reviews begins "" Where was this film when I was a kid? "" < br / > < br / > Just jaw - droppingly wonderful. It's so good it's difficult to put into words. 1 ) ; a lead villain who draws his evil power from something everyone in the world can relate to. < br / > < br / > This ranks as one of the greatest children's films ever made. Not for younger or more sensitive kids though. One of director Miike Takashi's very best.",1
A must see!,1
That's all it is. The singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun. Despite This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans.,1
"I Still think it's a great film, but it could be better than great. I'm rambling here, I know.",1
"... in our household. Babbette of gay Paris! "" I still to this day sing "" Hooray for me!",1
At the time I felt sad for the blue camel and his sad life.,1
I would love to own it.,1
Richard Willaims is an animation god.,1
"i once saw this movie whiile i was.. not sober. < br / > < br / > unique and wonderful! no, i'm not 10.. i'm 30!",1
"Mmm, yes a sequel indeed. I believe I received this film when I was a young buck. I still watch it. I am 17 years old now.",1
The Great Yokai War is Miike's attempt at a family film and damn fine job he does as well. The problem is that I can't imagine many parents wanting to subject their children to this movie.,1
Joe Raposo's songs are for the most part simply beautiful.,1
that'like 47 years ).,1
It continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are SIXTEEN of them. There's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop - - and every second it's something new. The others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren't too amazing to listen to. This is a very strange film by director / animator Richard Williams.,1
I was five years old at the time.,1
Though I have to admit it is not as good on a little TV. < br > < br / > Hope this helps.,1
"Woo - hoo! 10 stars on here, it's still a great kids film. < br / > < br / > It's out there. I didn't know it had been in a theater at all. I want to share it with my kids someday! Might even be on DVD by now, at least I hope it is.",1
"Specifically the Marlon Brando taffy pit enemy, The Greed. Acting : 8 - Every character suits their voice so well. How will they escape the Kookoo king and his henchmen!? Music : 10 - Nothing short of perfection here. Dolls that come to life when the master isn't around. I mean how far did the Raggedy's walk anyway? Delightful surprises await the two adventurers.",1
"Raggedy Ann and Andy set off to try to rescue her before Marcella discovers Babette is gone. < br / > < br / > While this movie was certainly disturbing and I just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie, this was actually pretty creative. In this pit they encounter the Greedy, who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full. What the heck? However, pirate Captain Contagious kidnaps her.",1
Ill never forget my experience watching it. By the way I'm saying complete opposite of what is true this movie is utter garbage.,1
I enjoyed it.,1
But a self - possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. I thought it was a great film. Highly recommended.,1
This deserves 10 / 10 and I'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon ( fingers crossed ). But after watching it again yesterday I've found it to be amazing.,1
Compelling and Innovative! This movie is about finding love in everybody's differences.,1
"The special effects are nothing less than breathtaking, and make any work by Spielberg look trite and elementary. ! Watching Theodore Rex is much akin to looking into face of God and hearing Him say "" you are my most beloved creation. "" This is one of the few films that is simply TO DIE FOR!!",1
"A little bit of Indian spirituality, mystic thriller and slasher movie mixed together. The dialogs are sometimes on soap - opera - level. The bad sound made it sometimes very hard to understand, what the characters are saying. Almost every actor look like a layman. I saw it on DVD and was glad to could rewind to listen it again. The cast sometimes is not more than average. < br / > < br / > 3. )",1

"eye, we also see him healing or at least comforting a patient. Previous to this story we have seen Lars Eriksson and notably his wonky ( lazy? ) Writer / director Andreas Marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for his skill in constructing the film. Good examples of this are found in the first story especially, dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital.",1
i'm waiting for second hit! is this is the dark side of new age?,1
"A good little find, this one, I'd give it 8 out of 10. Shakti tells the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, he was torn apart, and the suspect was a man that may not have existed. I found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and liked it a lot. Devi tells the tale of a young man who wants to "" jump out of his skin "". This is probably the best of the three segments.",1
The patient seems to have some type of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task. Reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participants. Things get quite bloody.,1
"That Japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching, scary and funny all at the same time. Now comes the hard part, trying to explain the film. Hats off This a dark Grimms tale with humor. Where was this film when I was a kid? After his parents split up Tadashi moves with his mom to live his his grandfather. Moms never really home. Watching it I felt I was reading a great book, and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book. but a great film none the less. Tadashi's sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone.",1
! What a surprise!,1
"TEARS OF KALI is a strange, gory, sometimes downright creepy film which is somewhat constrained by it's obviously low budget - but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watch. The journalist goes in under cover of wanting to research the Taylor - Erikkson cult, but we find that her true motives may hit a little closer to home. I have to say I'm pretty glad I did.",1
"Your average punter, I have found just does not write comments like that. I have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film Sommersault. I see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety. Peaches is truly a marvelous film. This manipulation of the media is pretty common down under. Or more particularly does not want to get it. Here is a film that has been significantly praised around the world as is simply one of the best Australian Films ever made. In conclusion if the film does not win all at this years AFI's and IF awards, then it is a rigged game. It fully deserved to win best picture.",1
"All made for TV. I really did enjoy this film much more than "" Somersault "" and "" Three Dollars "".",1
"Who knows - maybe they did. However, the narrative structure point is debatable. It's certainly very different to Monahan's first feature - THE INTERVIEW!",1
< br / > < br / > I liked the light and the girls.,1
Emma Lung is courageous and interesting.,1
This story is beautifully acted.,1
"'I also think Mandy62 was a bit unkind to Hugo Weaving. However, the movie really didn't need explanation. I'm glad I saw it.",1
Casting was superb.,1
"Some of the special effects are great though, with some very well animated creatures ( a mix of CG, stop - motion and puppetry ). ). He's really never been a one - trick pony, but often gets accused of it - perhaps YOKAI is designed to silence those critics. Perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors, but I think it's probably just that he wanted to do something different. Billed as Takashi Miike's "" first family film "" - by people who haven't seen Zebraman, presumably. Regardless, it's a great project for Miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into.",1
"The truths emerge gradually yet inexorably, clarifying not only Talia's life, but also her relationship with Yaara. Though without sight, she has insight. We accept fully her ability by the film's end to find her place in world more confidently.",1
"You enjoy it while you watch it, and you take it home with you. I can't say it is totally flawless, but it's near. Keren Acting - great, story - interesting and with elements of suspense.",1
"The animation was heavy CG in many scenes, but very good ones at that. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this film.",1
"< br / > < br / > But as Bruce gets involved with three young women, he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirl. I always said that the animated Batman movies were much better than the live action films.",1
It would become known as Batman : Mask of the Phantasm. The music was alright.,1
"Freeze or Phantasm were ). Batman : Mystery of the Batwoman is the latest animated Batman straight to video / DVD movie to be released. < br / > < br / > Don't get me wrong, I did find movie enjoyable. But just remember, it's not as good as the other Batman animated movies.",1
"It aired on TV yesterday, so I decided to check it out.",1
There was nice twist.,1
Most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise!,1
Hoping to find a copy soon!! !,1
"Kelly Ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects. Same thing goes for Robin. Why? Kevin Conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection. The late John Vernon will be missed. If you want to know who Batwoman is, then buy or rent the DVD.",1
< br / > < br / > It's a shame the DVD isn't so great. Why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond me. Batman : Mystery of the Batwoman was drawn and shot in 1. 1 soundtrack but... the movie is presented in Pan and Scan. This is definitely a movie no fan of Batman should be without. And Batman is denying any affiliation with her.,1
"< br / > < br / > I'm also not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie. 75 minutes is way too short for any movie. Also I think the fight with Bane should have been done better. It has good storyline, universal appeal and even great acting to top it off. I'd also like to see someone else figure out the mystery for a change finally. This is true in the Mystery of Batwoman.",1
"My all - time favorite, the Penguin, is here. < br / > < br / > Kelly Ripa did a much more decent voice - acting job than I was expecting. < br / > < br / > The score adds to the mysterious ambiance of movie. "" Bruce Wayne looks much like he has before, but now he appears somewhat less imposing. The revolution to the mystery is a delightfully sneaky twist.",1
In fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and old - fashioned senior management of Shane Longman as represented by Lee Wolf ( Richard Le Parmentier ) and James Farrell ( Denys Hawthorne ). Capital City'fans rejoice!,1
The show is less than an hour long. I liked watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I agree that Capital City should be on DVD.,1
I remember this series so well.,1
"When this doesn't work, he resorts to the draconian tactic of staging an arson of his own office, for which Randy is blamed. This point will return to dominate the last scene in the film. He does, however, quickly form a useful friendship with Gabby. Myrtle and Letty testify that he was in the apartment when the fire was discovered. This puts him and Letty in the < br / > < br / > Randy soon learns that his uncle, and by extension, himself, is not exactly popular among town folk.",1
"One trick is to bring in a pretty lady to befriend Scott and his partners. However, he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk - - the typical bad guy from Westerns. < br / > < br / > Once in town, Scott goes to this uncle about the job. And, it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery.",1
"Chill Wills rounds out the main cast as one of Tom Cloud's hired hands, and figures in the somewhat predictable finale. That seemed rather odd to me, particularly since he was addressed as Jeff almost immediately into the story. I'm inclined to think not. Approximately eighteen at the time of this movie, he bears a passing resemblance to Sean Penn.",1
"Gabby Hayes is a good sidekick, Lon Chaney is mean as always, and Randolph Scott a bit more cheerful than usual.",1
That includes not backing relatives up when they're villains. Albuquerque marked the last film he ever did for Paramount and they gave him a good one. Hadn't been seen in years. I'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot. < br / > < br / > Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing. He even has the sheriff in his pocket.,1
"Those Holodeck "" games "" are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members. ). "" < br / > < br / > This concept is used to expand Star Trek's possibility and enabling a kind of genre - mix.",1
The settings are superb and almost movie like. This episode introduced the Holodeck to the TNG world.,1
"The office itself is almost an exact replica of the one featured in Bogey's "" Maltese Falcon. "" He was such a handsome man back in 1940's. Oh, well... The best part of this episode, though, is the appearance of the famous Hollywood B - actor Lawrence Tierney in the role of the gangster Cyrus Redblock.",1
Outrage is pretty good movie!,1
Rotten kids. What a decade. Robert Culp. It was very intense.,1
"He presses charges, which arouses the kids'ire, and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign. It doesn't make a big generational thing out of it. Kudos for that. Robert Culp ( they call his character "" doctor ""... ). I think he's a vet or something ) and family move to an affluent, low - tax, zero - law - enforcement suburb.",1
"Remember, just because it's made - for - television doesn't mean it isn't great art. This is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made - for - television drama. The cars are really great as well, as I recall.",1
Moves at a nice pace to exciting climax.,1
"It's the kind they just don't show anymore. This is a very good, made for TV film. He stands up to them and protects his home and his family. A very good actor.. I might add.",1
Why? The plot was VERY predictable and but so what? I felt it all. They're kids and they act like kids would.,1
It's not a myth. Any girl can get pregnant first time.,1
"Besides, he is an incredibly Beautiful Man. Patricia Arquette was overacting much of the time. Always with A - list actors but just not always a "" hit "". But he is "" worth every penny "" of any DVD rented or purchased. WORTH EVERY PENNY! Really sexy. I really thought this wasn't that bad. See The Wedding Date with Debra Messing - one of his best overall films.",1
"The filmmakers should learn difference between raunchy and erotic. < br / > < br / > How dumb is that? The rest of the movie, however, leaves something to be desired.",1
"If you "" erotic, "" go watch that Red Shoes Diary junk.",1
"But I want my soft - core and my hard - core separate. But everything else in the film seems cheap. Women that could act and who would totally arouse you? Now they just make hard - core films without the hard - core sex. As plots go for this type of genre, not to bad. This low - budget erotic thriller that has some good points, but a lot more bad one. Even the title, "" Deviant Obsession "", sounds like a Hardcore flick. The woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot.",1
I saw it on late night TV.,1
I liked this movie.,1
THIS is the formula that they are using. THIS is what makes zombie movies so great.,1
"Nothing like it. That said, the rest is pretty bad.",1
"Nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of Italian zombie - flicks, but honestly why would we bother? Yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over - the - top gore compensates for everything! Truly Bad... but incredibly entertaining with fast - paced action sequences and several very creative zombie - madness situations. This movie is comparable to Umberto Lenzi's "" Nightmare City "". Recommended to fans ; don't mind the negative reviews. The undead birds were original, for example, and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well.",1
"Zombi 3 fits that bill, and then some. I give it an 8 / 10, just because of sheer enjoyment. There's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator.",1
It is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand.,1
"< br / > < br / > The zombies come in all varieties. Oh the head in the fridge! ? < br / > < br / > The gore is plentiful. This is no Dawn of the Dead folks. Legs are bitten off, arms amputated, stomachs burst open.",1
Also check out Zombi 4. There's even a flying zombie head! How rad is that?,1
"< br / > < br / > Overall, I actually liked this film. Basically, none of the films have anything to do with one another, but who cares when they make money. My favorite zombie was the machete - wielding maniac at the gas station. 4. Confusing enough? Zombie Birds. Zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making.",1
Oh Yeah!,1
"They're not the best, in terms of writing. I think the good over wins the bad.",1
I tell you I couldn't sleep for weeks! 10 out of 10. You'd think her parents would have been worried. For this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that I have since grown to enjoy. And was was with the telekinesis?,1
"On the way, naturally, they have a whole lot of problems. I love cartoons. His opening scene is a classic. There is one quite touching moment too, when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's eyes.",1
Another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends : ` All great guys are never around. The sensitive ones get eaten. The horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible. They find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them. Some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming.,1
The parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min. They begin as enemies and end as best friend.,1
"8 / 10 I am not going to lie, this is a great movie. Also, uniqueness in the characters is so interesting.",1
"The real letdown is the animation. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt.",1
The humor was absolutely great.,1
"< br / > < br / > I'm surprised at the low rating for this. Bravo, Mssr. I'm glad I gave it a chance. < br / > < br / > "" Bait "" ain't perfect. Foxx.",1
"They went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger, and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth. The morale of the film shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end.",1
"One thing more : Scrat. Shrek, anyone? 7 / 10",1
"If you don't hate cute animals making funny things, watch it at least once. [ Which means lots of work nevertheless! ] Even the "" evil "" is lovely, fluffy big cat with those funny teeth. After watching Ice Age I felt that's it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre.",1
He makes the movie all by himself.,1
The visuals were great. Simply beautiful. Not Ice Age.,1
Even for a sequel. ( spoilers?? ) But I was surprised that I was a bit entertained by it.,1
"'every time it's getting intolerably dull. '< br / > < br / > And of course, visually it won't disappoint, but that's almost a given with Pixar flicks. That doesn't make it bad, just not something I'd go far.",1
Scrat is cool! Nothing was forced or over done. < br / > < br / > The animation is superb.,1
"Our hero, Alvin Sanders ( played by Jamie Foxx ), was however irritating most of the part. Usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster. ). He is so out of place, cracking bad jokes, evoking no sympathy from audience.",1
This is a good movie for kids. His slothy slur was just too much for me. The worst part was the voice of Sid.,1
"We then see a herd going south for the coming Ice Age ( except for Manny, who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him ). Relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out, okay? He then pays toll with some aardvarks. Ice Age "" is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by Blue Sky Studios and released in 2002 as the company's first.",1
"Finally I got to see the infamous "" Ice Age "". Apart from maybe not being as dead funny as I'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word I can say about it. Plus the Dodo scene, which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002.",1
"The mother dies but Manfred and Sid decides to take him and return the baby for the humans. Diego, one of the sabers, decides to follow and help them to go to a shortcut to the human's camp. ( unless you are very severe! )",1
There parents also seemed engaged. Personally I liked the Scrat! I saw the movie with two grown children. !,1
"Including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering. < br > < br / > Enough technical babble, the film's entertaining, family - friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny. Just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially nice looking film.",1
"They are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch. As well, all of the characters have their own charms ( even the bad guys ). I was only 13 at the time, but even then I liked it. It had some sort of warmth. I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco Cinemas when it came out, back in'02.",1
"They are well rounded and completely believable, strangely. You know the outcome, but you can't help being drawn in. < br / > < br / > Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek.",1
"Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie.",1
< br / > < br / > It would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home. And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd.,1
Return To the Lost World was filmed back - to - back with the 1992 version of The Lost World. Gomez has something to do with this.,1
A man seeking oil brings a drilling crew to the plateau.,1
"When Isabel gets fed up with the John - Lily romance causing friction with the show, she leaves, and John decides to make Lily the star. Rating, 7. Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway to notice her, but he just gets annoyed with her antics.",1
It feels as though the production was too rushed.,1
The supporting cast includes some really great performances. Judy Garland ( enough said! ) < br / > < br / > 2.,1
"It's the best scene in the film as Gilchrist encourages Judy to keep at it. She did a couple of films with MGM and then went back to Europe for more work on the continent. That's her entrée, but Heflin's constantly barraged with stagestruck kids, but never anyone quite like Lily Mars.",1
< br / > < br / > Another point i didn't like was on opening night. If i were Lily i would be furious with John but she isn't... it just doesn't make sense. Well in this film she looks perfect.,1
"Probably because they were done in black and white. < br / > < br / > They really don't make television series like these any more. He did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name. After all trail driving was a lonely business back in the day before railroads got to all parts of the USA. But Fleming was a man of all business, he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it. What a pity. We'd get to see a lot more of a man who became a move legend. < br / > < br / > Rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it. Had he lived he might have become a name like Eastwood's.",1
"< br / > < br / > And then there's that great theme song, performed by the immortal Frankie Laine. < br / > < br / > I look forward to every episode ; I'm collecting the whole set. I would vote for him for President any day. imdb.",1
"The last new episode aired in November, 1965. Most of big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965.",1
Rawhide was a wonderful TV western series. Later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual story lines. All of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history. Focusing on a band of trail drovers lead by the trail boss Gil Favor. We shall not see his like again.,1
"The whole town gets a piece of Erendira, so to speak. It's done in a mature artistic manner. Excellente! The film also has some amazing costumes. The film only exists in a low quality VHS format. As they'd say in espanol, "" Es muy muy bien!!! """,1
"< br / > < br / > "" Erendira "" is gorgeous. But if not, VHS is better than never seeing it at all.",1
"Liked movie? Well, I'll be looking to buy a copy now. And, by the way, the original location in the story was Colombia. Yet, over the years, I had forgotten of its existence. This story is universal.",1
I liked this movie.,1
I was not disappointed. It raises a lot of questions but does not give answers. I think sometimes this is good. The movie is about a lot of things.,1
"I first rented this film many years ago, and was completely enthralled by it. < br / > < br / > The film is very atmospheric, arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality. < br / > < br / > Hopefully you will see the film in its Spanish language version, with subtitles.",1
and go at it. < br / > < br / > A bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school.,1
"It has all the characteristics of one. < br / > < br / > Chaulk this one up to being a guilty pleasure, I knew it's a bad film.",1
). Only for fans of truly bad slasher flick. However the dream finale is utterly pathetic.,1
"Alan Pudney's slick cinematography does the trick. Good, trashy fun. Co - producer Dick Randall has an amusing cameo as Munro's sleazy agent Manny.",1
"I was actually surprised at how good it was. < br / > < br / > I love the story. It's like Tamara ( 2005 ). Good cheesy slasher! I really sympathize with Marty. Though, not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.",1
"It could have been left off, or thought out better. I've never seen another movie like this one, well, not horror anyway. But... they are the only ones receiving them! It turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks.",1
"But still, you gotta love this stuff! I couldn't have predicted that bathtub scene in a million years. Well, it doesn't pretend to.",1
"But whoever it is, he's making quick work of them. Particularly nasty is girl that takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose innards popped all over her when he drank poisoned beer. For soon, they will die, of course.",1
If you don't buy rent it for a good time.,1
When Marty open the curtain butt naked he realized that he was tricked. One by one the people get killed off. The lab blows up disfiguring him badly. She almost got out the first time. Skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the teacher to excuse him. I wonder if it's because of the part he played in the movie.,1
"Then they finally break into the school and it starts storming. The coach puts a stop to it, but both parties swear revenge. ). and then is killed instantly. But, the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive.",1
"One of the things I like about the script is that it is a pure unashamed slasher flick, it doesn't try to be anything else & it just accepts the genres rules, short comings & trappings & plays up to them. Years later & the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school, they all arrive to discover they are the only ones there. Basically it delivers what it promises, homicidal killer, blood, boobs & babes.",1
"No. That jester hat ( or was it a mask? ) gets electrocuted. Then his stomach explodes? Classic crap all the way. But when I was 7, I was scared sh! That's why you're here anyway. What I saw in that movie stuck with me big time.",1
"The ending.... there is a twist. One of them set it up at the old high school. They begin looking for a way out. The last prank ended tragically. Hrr friend has just been killed, and she decides to take a bath!? I for one don't. it is a horror slasher. More importantly, why is there a bathtub in a school bathroom.",1
I first saw this movie when I was 12 in the sixth grade. Then I found out due to the current webpage at www. IMDb. He looked like a teenager.,1
"YES, the acting does range from average to laughable. In addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing. YES, the plot is hardly plausible and very thin. YES, it has been done so many times before.",1
"They're a bunch of sociopaths. The ending makes little or no sense. Marty, the killer, has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates. It is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout.",1
"A good villain makes a good slasher. God Bless 80's slasher films. Especially this film. This is a fun, fun movie. That's all it is. It isn't the 80's anymore.",1
"Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind's granddaughter, and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. A serious comedy. ""'s theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending.",1
Definetly worth watch.,1
Everyone should watch.,1
They are ignoring a VERY good movie. I highly recommend this movie.,1
"The character actors in this film were a great plus also. This woman was lonely since the death of her husband. Sad. To prevent that, she bought it.",1

This is the most confronting documentary I have ever seen. 10 / 10 definitely!,1
The birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards. It is not a simple right or wrong. Put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show. It needs a whole new way of thinking '. The artist Edward Burtynsky explains the method wonderfully.,1

And for an Action / Comedy, it was very well done. < br / > < br / > This movie was an Action / Comedy flick, and that's all it was intended to be. Don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre, people.",1
There are a good many stills of the photographer's work - - or were some of them made by the film crew? But this photographer isn't as interested in seeing people up close. This is a world of relentless industrialization. The emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they're herded around outside in little yellow jackets. < br / > < br / > Edward Burtynsky is the name of photographer.

"Domino was very, very entertaining and often very funny. I also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories. When I rented Domino I was expected it to be very dumb.",1
* Kiera Knightly alludes to Domino Harvey's sexuality her interview with Lucy Liu. * Domino Harvey father's mostfamous film was Manchurian Candidate ( which appears in the film ).,1
Delroy Lindoi gives a good supporting performance. The action scenes are exhilarating. She shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Domino is a great movie. The script is good.,1
"The talk show scene is "" disgustingly "" real. She's the undisputed main character, Domino, a bounty hunter. This movie portrays a difficult life. So, this stomped me a bit.",1
"She basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off, Ed and Choco. I doubt much of this film is based on a true story. They let her join the group.",1
"To me, Foxx is an original. I thought it was highly entertaining ; it was fun.",1
"Yes, it is highly stylized, flashy and over the top, but it is very entertaining. I think Tony Scott made a good movie here.",1
i found it to be rather awesome.,1
"On the surface, its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie. 8. If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie. Experimental Cinematography barely describes this movie. This movie contains what Hemmingway described as the "" iceberg effect "". Definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate.",1
"Not once did I think of Kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume. This is entertainment, after all! And any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well.",1
"Here Scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage. < br / > < br / > "" Man On Fire "" was an extreme departure, a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic. She grasps at memories as we all do - in fragments, flashes and brief snatches. "" Domino "" has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and "" sickening "" photography.",1
"CUT. ). It's a mess, but it's a rather enjoyable mess. It becomes a pastiche of MTV culture at this point. By now it is evident that most people don't appreciate Tony Scott's choppy, flashy, dizzying editing technique.",1
and quite understandable.,1
I'm so happy I found them here. This TV - series was one of the ones I loved when I was a kid.,1
"At the same time, they learn things us parents didn't know until way, way later. The series is very well made, does not show its age, and our kids at various ages really like to watch it.",1
< br / > < br / > I remember watching this as a kid in the 80s ( with Swedish voices ).,1
Actually this movie was not so bad.,1
"Yes, this is biology but they will never tell it is.",1
< br / > < br / > A good film again from Korea.,1
"Therefore, the film is fun and entertaining. And that's exactly what it was.",1
"It seems the only "" great "" movies these days are amazingly shocking or high - budget / hyped in some way. < br / > < br / > In short, this film will leave you feeling fresh, determined, and satisfied. Sure, the plot isn't Oldboy.",1
Go see this wonderful feel good movie! First things first! I was surprised how funny this movie was!,1
Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie.,1
"But even then it's enjoyable. ! Dreamquest is by far, the best porn movie I've ever viewed.",1
Oh yeah! Jenna Jameson did it again! It was one of the 1st movies i saw of her.,1
"An unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle imitation. This one is quite a nice surprise. A slight minus only for ( very ) few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief. Loved that scene with icicles, absolute classics potential. < br / > < br / > 9 / 10 including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect.",1
David Morse again is a wonderful portrayer of a cop. Overall it was pretty good movie. Morse ends up coming down hard on Hutchinson.,1
"Maybe someday I will see perfect combination of porn and plot. Also, I'd like to see more attempts like this one.",1
"Dreamquest is definitely raised bar of quality of adult movies. The great Jenna Jameson doesn't do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of. The actors of this movie done really good acting, they all done a great job. Felecia and Stephanie Swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned.",1
"< br / > < br / > Watch out for this one... And by way, the sex IS hot.",1
All the characters are multi dimensional - none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong. Saw this movie twice at community screenings and really loved it.,1
"I don't see that in too many movies nowadays, at least not those that would be considered Black films. I was satisfied with the way it was portrayed. < br / > < br / > Pros : I really enjoyed this film bringing Jamaican culture.",1
"< br / > < br / > It's an American film, but it's not a US film. ( No, it's not a foreign language ). Like so many films, this isn't Shawshank. < br / > < br / > I liked the music. The characters were easy on the eyes.",1
"'Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? "" I watch them all. < br / > < br / > In summary, if you tend to like dance movies, then this is a decent one. I liked driven Mum character. Comments about the dialogue seem off to me. 'How she move.",1
This movie surprised me.,1
To my surprise the acting wasn't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good. Go see the movie and judge for yourself. The fact that it has a lower rating than You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous.,1
That's absolutely ridiculous! How She Move isn't perfect of course ( what film is?,1
And how surprised I was! Really good actually. I even cried at the end of the movie.,1
I saw this movie when I was a little girl. It teaches children good vs. bad. Enjoy and Happy Holidays! Feliz Navidad! And I have enjoyed it every time.,1
"The DVD is cheap and easy to come by, the length is now standard and you've gone long enough without it. Better, I think, then SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS. ( My version of choice is The Mystery Science Theatre 3000 edition ). How good / bad / strange / is it? If you get bored, just go downstairs and play the piano. "" It never fails to make me laugh.",1
"< br / > < br > ). < br / > < br / > The film will endear children to both Santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world. And the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents. In the end, everyone, including the nasty boys, get just what they deserve for Christmas! Not a bad film for a low - budget job.",1
"Visions of Hell? I mean, really, the Devil vs. Santa? Creepy laughing wind - up reindeer? It is the worst thing I've ever seen.",1
"Similarly, I will never understand this film, and that is brilliant. Seriously, this is no understatement.",1
"! What I remember most was the silly Devil and Santa looking through his telescope. I would usually find it playing on a Saturday afternoon. Yes, it is a different film about Santa Claus and that is what makes it special and unique.",1
"< br / > < br / > You owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece. Think movie makes you think. Great films. Unlike other Santas, he is a normal person. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie gets 500 / 10.",1
This movie surprised me.,1
"This is definitely an appropriate update for the original, except that "" party on the left is now party on the right. "" < br / > < br > Like the original, this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty.",1
I found the 1971 version quite boring.,1
"He's running, desperate to be with his hospitalized wife, the police are the least concern. This is better than Bullitt, a boring movie with what, a muscle car chase that was filmed badly?",1
"However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona prominently featured in the film. Despite all of the good things, soundtrack was atrocious.",1
This was a great role for him. I am not sure how I feel about the ending. And it was touching. This was not a great movie but it is watchable.,1
"I have to say, I loved Vanishing Point.",1
The words of Disc Jockey.,1
a drama?,1
"Thought it was a terrible, irrational piece of junk.",1
"The young Hagar is played by Christine Horne who is exceptional in her first feature role. Despite Hagar's pleading, her relationship with Bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot. This is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of Manawaka, condemning the young couple to a life of poverty. As she nears the end of her days, she reflects that "" pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear. < br / > < br / > Going through the motions of her marriage to Bram, Hagar withdraws from social activities to The story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl.",1
She WAS Hagar through and through. The loss seemed stronger. It was worth the wait and then some. Her scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying.,1
"This movie is about basically human relations, and the interaction between them. This journey is precipitated because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home. I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon.",1
"6 / 10 on the 11 % of idiots who gave it 1 / 10. I can only blame its current lowish rating of 6. Having said that, I'm so glad I gave Stone Angel the viewing it so very much deserved.",1
"It resonated when I was young, and it resonates even more now.",1
I'd highly recommend it.,1
A real find.,1
You can tell the Stone Angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film. Great film! I can't wait to see it on the big screen again!,1
"As in life... understanding brings empathy. At first, her attitudes and behaviors don't make much sense. If it is in a theater near you... GO! She swept me into her character - hook, line and sinker.",1
She plays her role well. This is a really interesting movie.,1
"I saw the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried. What a scene! Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. She is mean.",1
I loved it..,1
I can watch and re - watch the tape 100 times. I laugh my a * * off and I cry on some moments.,1
"This movie has some Capra flavor, that´s why is so good. < br / > < br / > Yes indeed, Life Stinks.",1
"They absolutely loved it. It's hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of family, however. < br / > < br / > Hence, for the children, a 9 / 10 from me.",1
Who are his true friends? < br / > < br / > Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.,1
This is a charming movie.,1
That should count for something. The fanboy mentality strikes again. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. Bait is one of most underrated movies of 2000 period. Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen. When this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. Even laughing quite a bit. Even my ex - girlfriend said this movie questionable.,1
"Even if you can't track down the video, the soundtrack is worth it too. It has some Muppified traditional favorites, but also some original Denver tunes as well.",1
"She's a widow who can't move on, he's illiterate and a closet - inventor - - you can probably guess the rest. Adaptation of Pat Barker's novel "" Union Street "" ( a better title! )",1
Even those from era should be turned off. Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.,0
It has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid - air hi - jacking & then the crashing ( didn't he see the oil rig? ),0
"Even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play. He never convinced me he was in love with the princess. < br / > < br / > I was disappointed this movie. But, don't forget it was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself. I just don't know. Just exactly who was the chef in love with?",0
And i'm no fan f his either. Especially when dialogue is two people complaining. Otherwise this was a ripoff of Bergman. The absence of a sound track was brutal. The loooonnnnng shots were too long.,0
"It's never about resolution, it's only about interminable introspective babble. The film is painfully slow and dull. When I was little my parents took me along to the theater to see Interiors. But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman. But beyond that, I simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters.",0
"I would have to agree with. In Robin Wood's view, it's a strange form of cultural snobbery. """,0
"I'll take "" Interiors. "" That was an old poem. Woody's rarely made a funnier movie. "" Far from not caring about these people, however, I found them quite hilarious. Oh.",0
"What a waste, not just for viewers but for the actors as well.",0
This film is mediocre at best.,0
I really didn't get Woody's ( Carter ) private life or boyfriend either. The film is bad. < br / > < br / > Don't see it! There is no other way to say it. He played his character ( Car ) flawlessly. Unless you are true Harrelson fan. I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 70's. It didn't work. What was he thinking? It is painful!,0
"It is monotonous. This movie is not worth your time. This film is one giant pant load. He couldn't have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick. But, his is not the worst accent in the movie. If you like these three actresses, watch them in something else. That's kind of good reason to cast someone else don't ya think?",0
One near the beginning - one at the end. Together these events make up maybe 5 % of the total movie time.,0
Movie sitcom style. Not realistic but interesting nevertheless.,0
It's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion. Maybe it is because of stiff upper lip of the higher social class? Blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing. That's how slow it is.,0
This movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years.,0
This one is definitely one to miss. When will Lauren Bacall pick a good one? It seemed to be included only to titillate viewers.,0
It is not a horror or science fiction movie.,0
And there's a twist at end.,0
"However, for nostalgia buffs, some mindless fun. ), but the ghost is a little late in arriving.",0
Kareena Kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm. < br / > < br / > Saif is sidey ala Main Khiladi.. once again.,0
"I rented this on DVD and I kind of feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so earnest about it in the DVD comments. Otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully. Plus, it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways, and the characters'behavior often strains belief. And that gets to the big problem, which is that it really doesn't have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point.",0
Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. Why? Saif Ali Khan doesn't get his due in here. But how could he okay a role like this? < br / > < br / >'Tashan'is a boring film.,0
""". There is no story, no humor, no nothing!",0
"< br / > < br / > After watching it, I knew why. It was entertaining, but it was fundamentally weak. Just like it's literal English title, which means "" Style "", Tashan is all style, but little substance. When I watched Jodha Akbar, it was a full house, but it wasn't for Tashan. 9 % of the screens dedicated to screening it. Tashan was billed as one of THE most highly anticipated for 2008, but I was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas.",0
"Kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and Akshay comes up as the dim - wit. Shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to. Saif Ali Khan - completely disappointed in your choice of film. Anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for English. His cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last 15 minutes, it was enough to pop a blood vessel.",0
But it is not slick. But he is in his stereotyped self. I guess Tashan when translated will mean style. You won't mind missing film.,0
"The film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar. An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar. That itself was a clear indicator of the director's vision. The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshay's love story. < br / > < br / > In short IT'S THE BIGGEST WASTE OF RESOURSES AFTER "" JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM "". After the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music.",0
"It reminded me of some of the early 80's movies. And for that, I give rating of 2 out of 10. < br / > < br / > Thats all. Then, the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences.",0
1 / 10 is the least I can give on IMDb or I would give a zero. It is hilarious. The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar.,0
"But this cannot be said for Anil Kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain. I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a Yashraj Film. With reference to songs, unfortunately, there is not one song that I can remember now. Yes!",0
Even Anil Kapoor's terrible English couldn't save this discomfiture. Race was hot on heels and that is a million times better.,0
Rent Kino's Journey instead. Yaaawwnnn...,0
And last but not the least about Kareena. Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie. < br / > < br / > This type of movies are actually made for flop. But he has fully developed himself in the acting field. it is a Yes slim!!!,0
The movie is a complete disappointment in all areas. All the action scenes I wish I could have forwarded. I just saw the movie in theater. Thats it. Now days Bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from Hollywood. But in Bollywood this is certainly not going to work. I think Bollywood now should forget about the action movies. Kareena's beauty and a couple of songs may be. The movie has very few good points to talk about. They cant make it.,0
CRAP. There was nothing much to do for him in the movie. fools!!!! Kareena Kapoor looked bad. Said Ali khan was alright. The storyline was okay.,0
"They tend to exaggerate way too much. Even the storyline was weightless. The actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all. Everything was terrible from the start. But, Hindi cinema's signature are songs. Good Luck next time.",0
Utter waste of time. Hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace.,0
"< br / > < br / > Go away man, i need to puke! But after loads of amazing promos, Tashan finally ended as heart attack. that song is such nice, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and that is not taken in the music album!!!",0
Akshay is good.,0
"Thats it. The film lacks style, i mean original style.",0
She now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her. < br / > < br / > Kareena Kapoor. Including me. This movie is horrible. An unachieved film.,0
"OK, I am not Japanese. < br / > < br / > However, I thought the animation was really cool. Maybe. Other than that, I am Spanish, I eat paella and I like black humor.",0
begins to meander and at one point completely loses it. Vishal - Shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes.,0
"Bad films are bad films and we see some every week, but Tashan is not just a bad film, it's a terrible film. But the treatment's so over - the - top, so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect.",0
"Kerala, Rajasthan, ( Ladakh? ) Such a long awaited movie.. were all saturated with color, alright.",0
Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2. A story 2. 5. < br / > < br / > Things I liked about the movie : 1. A choreographer 3.,0
But the movieee just forget it. This is the biggest Flop of 2008.,0
Anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not. She was unbearable throughout the film.,0
The episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah. Then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home. The worst episode.,0
"). Except, it's not amusing or entertaining - it's just annoying. < br / > < br / > Awful. I've now written reviews for several of the MoH episodes, and this is among the worst. The end. These directors are mailing this tripe.",0
Will they kill guys instead of women?,0
"Storytelling math 101. "".",0
"In the opening sequences of this film, you are given the explanation. You will see Mr.",0
A huge disappointment from writer Hamm and director Dante. This poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered.,0
"It's silly, not thoughtful, and boring.",0
Starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie. Sol Polito's camera work is strong. This is one of Warner's few hard - edged melodramas that simply doesn't work.,0
A little girl's dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification. Beware of the English subtitles on the recent R1 release - - they aren't very accurate.,0
"Super - Duper bad. There is too much to criticize, so I will not bother. I'm not alone in admiring the first Superman movie, a film that Richard Donner executed masterfully.",0
"And will he continue to "" turn back time "" for every confrontation? Now as an adult, I can see how the mighty had fallen with S2T ( See : my review. ) Kids no longer had to impatiently wait for Superman to appear on screen, as in part I. In fact, they all but wrote the words : "" Previously on Superman "" in S2RD. Gone, was the great Superman change scene, the entire Paris rescue, as was the wonderful recap of part I in S2T's opening.",0
Susannah York was hardly a slouch. Tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd.,0
"Hey, this is pretty neat! What we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes Superman IV look airtight and coherent. It seems like a winning situation. The best effects in this are from the original productions. Lester's Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly. And it is only a very few times. The best scenes in The Donner Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut should be a fan's dream come true.",0
< br / > < br / > I am truly amazed. Was I supposed to be impressed with the motel shots? What was up with the pumpkins?,0
I didn't. I was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina.,0
Avoid at all costs!,0
"The heart and moral centre of the story is gone. The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clichés. But it's crap. It doesn't help that this Frankenstein is a conniving, devious murderer ; he deserves everything he gets.",0
Nintendo!!! The ending REALLY SUCKED. How could you do this to me? Don't go watch this at any costs. The plot SUCKED.,0
"unlike the first one, this is not a good film at all. pokemon the movie was a terrible film. oh well, maybe next one will be better.",0
8 almost here.,0
"This wouldn't have been a problem, except for one thing. Why? Possibly the fans, but I'm sure not the parents. This one : nauseating. Pokémon fans are suffering in America these days. They are excellent movies. Then, there's the theme song. It was fun and enjoyable.",0
Everything else is not. There's definitely better examples of both genres.,0
This is an awful film. Something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie. The clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent. Yea the girls are pretty but its not very good.,0
"Then enter a fresh faced Justin Timberlake. The movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it. SPOILER ( NOT!!! ) Oh and lots of gun fire, i mean a whole lot.",0
"George "" Gabby "" Hayes is Mr. Rogers's ex - pal, Sheriff Gabby. The songs are fine, though badly synched.",0
"I saw this film at its premier at Sundance 09. The screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian. On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can safely pass on this one. Almost all rate this movie poorly and expose shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on. < br / > < br / > Since American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I had hopes for Towelhead. If you are such a person, by all means, rent Towelhead and be moved by it. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. It embarrasses me to read them, but it does not surprise me. < br / > < br / > On the other hand, the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled.",0
Where is the truth? Please watch Dr. Strangelove and understand meaning of black humor.,0
"Hollywood's misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits. Unfortunately, "" Grease 2 "" is not even unintentionally funny.",0
The change is only in the sex.,0
It was Disney story gone horribly awry.,0
"< br / > < br / > It's not that Grease 2 is bad, it's just not all that great. But being a nerd just isn't going to cut it. The music score isn't remotely as good as the songs that come from the original.",0
"< br / < br / > < br / > Another year at Rydell and the music and dancing hasn't stopped. Well, find out for yourself. Well, at least my theater group did, lol. < br / > < br / > Grease 2 is like a silly TV show of some sort that didn't work.",0
It has fans? NO STARS from * * * *,0
"< br / > < br / > 2. When I was 11, Grease 2 was like crack.",0
< br / > < br / > The story has massive holes in it.,0
Ren Personal Best instead. I guess I'm not the target audience for this but I'm not sure who is.,0
This movie is nothing.,0
Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave. ! No cliche is left unturned. It's so unbelievable.,0
Direction istaggeringly bad. The only thing worse is the film itself. No kidding.,0
It is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play. Come! It was either Kate's friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her. And there was no happy medium.,0
The film is nothing special.,0
Definite a waste of money.,0
< br / > < br / > A creepy film ; worth seeing!,0
WORST FILM IN MOVIE MAKING HISTORY!! I don't think so. ! Why would Blockbuster released such crap? THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!,0
"Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA. The answer is : subterranean ; Lommel dug a pit and buried it. This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best - worst of EW. < br / > < br / > The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies. < br / > < br / > The sets are excruciatingly bad.",0
< br / > < br / > Do not waste your time watching this film.,0
At least they had the decency to do this much! This movie is a joke. Why?,0
The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes. I cannot believe that this movie was ever created. It is never explained.,0
"Seriously crappy movie. < br / > < br / > The "" bad "" cop repeats this process, and even once with a tit scene ( made it slightly better ). One girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies, like ya do.",0
? Who cares about the cops uniforms!? It was SO BAD. Those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be. I cant believe blockbuster carries this movie. DON'T BE FOOLED!!,0
This BY FAR is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about. ! Mt little sister and I are self - proclaimed horror movie buffs.,0
< br / > < br / > This film is... well... I wrongly assumed it was about zombies.,0
This film has to be the worst I have ever seen.,0
But it should at least have a story. I stopped by BB and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend. So I'm not expecting much.,0
* And the bad guy... Holy Crap! * Acting was over done... poor directing. Which doesn't say much. * Sound was badly dubbed.,0
Thank God! There are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie.,0
"Well, it's pretty bad. LL Cool J is terrible in this film.",0

ANYTHING is better.,0
This movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world. < br / > < br / > The box makes this movie out to look well OK at best. DO NOT LET THAT FOOL YOU.,0
< br / > < br / > 0 / 10 and that's generous. It's pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time.,0
"This movie had me going. DEAD WRONG! As you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved. Sure the eating and killing is there, but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement?",0
"< br / > < br / > Absolutely WORTHLESS. No, it was a hundred times WORSE. He tells his cop partner to wait in the car. The scenes I saw were as bad as an Ed Wood movie.",0

I'm not even kidding. It was poorly made and the actors couldn't act. It was a waste of my time and money. I wish i would have watched it before i rented it. Which watching the credits was the best part of movie.,0
It didn't. I only spent $ 2.,0
"Did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the'zombies'eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? I have seen thousands of films in my time, many excellent, many forgettable. Did I really see what I thought I saw?",0

Where are the images in the film that are on the box? This is one of the worst films ever. I want my money and time back. You have been warned!,0
It's beyond insulting.,0

Public service broadcasting - yeah right!,0
"I must concur. < br / > < br / > Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all. The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner.",0
Utter Utter drivel. The acting was so awful that it was almost funny. I can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is.,0

"His best was just fodder for bored teenagers. I can't spoil it by telling you the ending. Made with some surplus Air Force and Navy flying film. This one tips the scales, then falls off. And a lot of boom - booms. Whatever. The characters are all cardboard. The story is double lame.",0

"The main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists. Here's a list on top of my mind. I also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot. That would be an excellent time. So here's what my reactions to it are. It's easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors. Maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles. It just bored me. However, the movie doesn't shock or disturb me at all.",0
"On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists. The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones ( although not very far ) is that the sexual content is not glorified. Some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive, but that's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience's need to see this woman seek revenge. A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them. I've seen the Gator Bait films, and this is almost exactly the same thing as those. < br / > < br / > The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks.

"There's nothing to recommend this film for really ; but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks, you might find some enjoyment here. The naked ladies tend to look great, and if it wasn't for them, this film would get very boring very quickly. The only real highlight film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves. This film actually works from a fairly original idea - I've never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway. However, the way that it executes this idea isn't original in the slightest ; we follow a bunch of kids that, for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest. This is one of the film's major assets, as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown - the only problem is that Forest of the Damned doesn't ever seem to have much up its sleeve.",0

As figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new. So far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message. Then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does. It had an interesting side to it but it just doesn't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original. Though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through. So far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie I've seen was Juno.,0

Ah well. My kids didn't enjoy it either.,0

The plot... silly. That would stop her. I'm a sucker. But they have a plan. Rubbish.,0

An archeologist is assigned to study / dig the place where the key was found. The Minion is about... well, a minion. The movie lacks energy, and just trods along.",0

The resolution and quality are poor. After some internet surfing, I found the "" Homefront "" series on DVD at ioffer. com.",0
I want a refund... Can I have my $ 16 back? Or was that the point? Why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading? Why did I waste my money on this on the last day of Sundance? It was not very artistic.,0

How can people possibly give this a 10?,0
I didn't even watch the whole thing.,0
I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young. Even movie's musical number ( which had been Disney's specialty for years ) stunk. I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films. House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all.,0

< br / > < br / > And poor Julia Roberts. It's none of above. Now that's entertainment.,0
The romance was not really romance. The jokes were not funny.,0
"Pure genius. I found this film to be an utter dissapointment. ( Spoilers ) Azaria was reasonably amusing as the Mexican lover and Walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse - maverick - Dogme type director - but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead ( Spoilers ) we were treated to Billy Crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog. Julia Roberts is feeble, Zeta - Jones is just plain annoying ( appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity, minus the humour ), Crystal just plays his same old hyper - active, neurotic, annoying alter - ego and Cusack simply walks through his part, apparently bored with the whole project.",0
"Have you ever heard the saying that people "" telegraph their intentions? """,0
The chemistry between the leading characters is non - existent. Writing is trivial. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy.,0
who gets the guy. for short. i really didn't care what would happen with the main characters. in the first hour or so nothing really happens.,0
But this movie was terrible.,0
"This is not a lie. It was disgusting and painful. Charming and sweet, but with no purpose.",0
"Even Julia's fat suit is lame. So much potential, yet so painful to sit through. Wow, what a great cast! A script, you say?",0
I felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore - fest. How this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me.,0
"Unfortunately, that theme wasn't explored to it's full potential. Too little, too late. This is truly awful, more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise.",0
"And I mean ultra light. How about as a romantic comedy? In fact, as the old joke goes, they should have forgotten script and filmed the deal. Zeta - Jones does a good job with what she's given, but she's given practically nothing. Not on your life.",0

Watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh. But don't expect anything spectacular. I'm not even gonna go on.,0
What might not be expected is that a film with a kid and Shaquille O'Neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy! So is there a camp factor to the movie?,0

"It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank. I mean, it was deplorable. I feel like I'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by Branagh's performance. I second that notion. One of the previous reviewers questioned why U. S. actors were not cast in this film.",0
"That's not a great idea. < br / > < br / > 4. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...?",0

Very unusual for Mr. Altman.,0
MST3000 would have a blast with this one. It is so horrible it is not even funny. Shaq better just stick to basketball.,0
He is utterly without talent at both discplines. What a pathetic movie. I'm still trying to get back the couple hours I wasted on it.,0
"The development of Jane's childhood and character were exceptional. The big disappointment was that beginning opened so much hope, and then the end dashed it.",0
"Wrong!!! Finally, why was the plot changed at the end?",0
I didn't care about Jane or Mr. Rochester.,0
"But then again, nah. Everything looked really authentic, that's something I guess.",0
"We know that they are supposed to fall in love, but we never see it actually happen. In addition, his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes. So much of the novel had been left out and I considered William Hurt to be terribly miscast as Rochester. This 1996 movie was the first adaptation of Jane Eyre that I ever watched and when I did so I was appalled by it.",0
"Given a better scripting, perhaps the film would have been more successful. See "" Jane Eyre "" ( 1970 ) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for outstanding production.",0
It has been about 24years since I read the book as it was in school. ! I love it so much I watch it regularly. The actors are good but aren't given enough time to do this story justice.,0
There is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie. Because he was THINKING WITH HIS LITTLE HEAD!,0
"What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking? The marriage proposal, the fortune teller... gone. mini series with Timothy Dalton. It's true that this movie's two leads were sadly miscast.",0
"A wonderful time is guaranteed. No, back to the BBC - version.",0
The whole Christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of movie. This movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book.,0
There is no comparison. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all. And William Hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy. She would have been better - cast as Mrs Fairfax. < br / > < br / > There is no mystery surrounding the story of Rochester's first wife.,0
"York was too old, tall and pretty to play Jane, but no one has touched Rochester's character the way that Scott did. This version is pretty insipid, I'm afraid.",0
The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The title character seemed dry and uninspired.,0
"The scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history. Sure enough, MASSIVE FAILURE! He just doesn't have it in him. I don't know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker.",0
"This film took itself way too seriously and just didn't know when to end. Her credibility exceeded all others by far. Tom Cruise comes off well by comparison his misogynist, foul - mouthed Holy Roller was rather amusing. Neither does the uneven level of performances.",0
"The bit with the frogs is good though. There's some high calibre actors fair enough, and none turns in an average or worse performance. < br / > < br / >'Magnolia'is poor, and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed.

That's not just my considered verdict on this film, but also on the bulk of what has been written about it.",0

He's a lawyer for Christ's sake.,0
Its full of self - indulgence and loaded with bad acting. First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT. What is it about?,0
Glad so many of you enjoyed it!,0
So go figure. Once. < br / > < br / > 2 / 10.,0
The biggest kick in pants was the ending frog scene. I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon ( which I liked ). I almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours.,0
But it never seemed to connect. Sorry did i miss something? did i walk out early? The first ten minutes of unusual ( and untrue! ),0
This is a waste of time. < br / > < br / > Think about it - - Tom Cruise made ugly - - why? Great cast.,0
Where is the reason to care for these people? There are two ideas in particular that bomb. My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree. But it all adds up to nothing.,0

"Harlow never explains about the witness'accusing her of murder and her panic! It simply doesn't come together like it should. This early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction. The casting is strange, also. And that's a shame. Harlow mistakenly assumes Tone is the Lord who owns the Rolls, and she sets her sights on him. This is no gem - not even semi - precious.",0
!,0
"Each of the substories is more formulaic than the last, and the sets get worse and worse as movie runs. Once that's out of the way though, it is all downhill. It is, however, an homage to many of the great horrors of old, films from most notably the Amicus stable. I actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running. The gore content is, quite frankly, laughable.",0
It SURPRISINGLY had a plot! < br / > < br / > It ripped off some movies SO badly just for single scenes. The movie was bad but I've seen worse.,0

5 % of the things that happened in this movie just happened for sake of being Satanic. When I saw the Lesbian sex scene for the sake of a Lesbian sex scene I LAUGHED EVEN HARDER. To me this movie seemed like 80. That was really it.,0
"I give it a 2 out of 10. Altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester. In this case, it was a big miss. I rented this DVD for two reasons. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one - time Oscar winners.",0

Avoid this movie at all costs.,0
The DVD transfer is typical Alpha.,0
"I'll leave you to guess which one it was to be. These are the only motivations I can see that would coerce good actors to take on roles in this movie. I cannot understand why Robert Altman would take this job. Surely he has some power to pick and chose. Or, in the case of Downey's & Hannah's characters, apparently superfluous.",0
I don't think it is a noir film at all. This was a disappointing film for me.,0
"She's just not convincing in the role. Take the lead actor, Lee J. Cobb.",0

"Hip. The cop saves the girl ( waitress! ) If nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and Alosio, along with some of the supporting cast, shows signs of talent. He's decent enough, especially considering he isn't used to speaking roles.",0

This picture was the worst.,0
Very disappointing.,0

"The two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men. Alastair Sims is always a joy to see but he, too, is terribly underused. If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize, this is movie for you.",0
"Altogether, I have no problem in saying that "" I Love 80's "" was / is trash of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore.

There's no energy there. Hard to believe they meant a lot to each other.,0

A familiar movie plot... Being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Damage control needs to fix this damage of a film. Usually a revolting film is watchable for the wrong reasons. This movie is unwatchable. It was a serious movie but could not be taken seriously.,0
"Hence its limited theatrical release, speedy journey to DVD. Consider yourself warned.",0
This is a truly terrible film.,0

Why then do we learn almost nothing about anyone's background? And Alex is the most developed, if you can call it that, character in the entire film. This sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what I heard about "" Gigli "", that Ben and Jen flop earlier this Summer.

"The same goes for these sorts of movies. Cheese's attention. Just ask William Peter Blatty. At least, it's not horror in the usual sense.",0
Interest is misleading. There was no real suspense. Most of the characters were insipid.,0
it isn't. Do you think Mr. Voerhoven did that on purpose? is it funny?,0
He was just too pathetic here. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick.,0

"Ledger, in particular, has a particularly stunning scene of despair in an otherwise monochromatic performance. The sin - eaters were seen as blasphemous, circumventing the chruch's monopoly on redemption.",0
But put in some blah - blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged. There is no substance whatsoever in this entire film. This movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride. Seems like an uninspired concept.,0

"I rejoiced, as Reed to me was the epitome of Flashman. The penchant for slapstick spoilt'The Three Musketeers'for me and the same applies here. Mr Fraser is a tremendously skillful writer, but I am not a fan of his film screenplay work with Richard Lester. What kills the film is that it is made as a comedy. The Flashman books are uproariously funny in parts, but they are adventure novels. Flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow ). Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck. How I would have loved to see him in the role.",0
"This was a full year before he started doing Perry Mason, so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting. Raymond Burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend ( Dick Foran ) thanks to his affection for his friend's wife ( Angela Lansbury ). Lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious. He does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesn't notice when she comes into room I guess. < br / > < br / > There isn't all that much else here that's interesting though.",0
< br / > < br / > This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers.,0
"My mind is still scarred. To put it plainer, Reve likes the Dutch sausage. The whole movie is revolved around shock value. Now Reve and Christine's boyfriend could be "" THE 4TH MAN. "" The storyline makes sense with no plot holes. Plus there's a lot of blood.",0
It'just another vehicle to show off Landons horrendous hair.,0
This is the worst film i have seen in a long time. So do yourself a favor.,0
It was dull and boring.,0
I watch a lot of bad movies. I pride myself on that fact. Bad thing is that she didn't have much of plan. And not one but two innocent people die. The idiot didn't even believe he killed her. Decent music and imagery. OK... Now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret. Only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped.,0
"I would not call this a horror movie. First, I'm going to say that it looks great. really?...",0

Terrible movie. 0 out of 100. This movie isn't worth the film it was photographed on. What? Enough already.,0
"Once the plot comes together, the movie ends. Of course no good can come of this. A plot that has been done many times. The acting was lousy for the most part.",0
It was a horror in the true sense of word. I was numb!,0
She also fits in a little lesbian activity. To be honest Lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare. The cast are largely awful and mainly very average looking too.,0

"I'm kinda torn on DARK ANGEL. These re - enactments take up literally 75 % of the films run - time, and give virtually no insight into Bettie as a person. Almost the entire film is comprised of "" re - enactments "" of some of Bettie's more "" famous "" photo - shoots and loops. No joke - check the cast list.",0
"I don't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point. This movie was bad beyond belief. We all understood by the end. look like Citizen Kane. This movie makes "" Dude, Where's My Car? "" Bettie Paige's movies I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival. The only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good. The movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least. The cuts, the graininess, and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience. This was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory.",0
"Also of note is some faithful attention to detail. And, at times, she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie.",0
The movie is outdated. This accounts for cheesy acting very often.,0
Every class had something to do with this terrible show. I'm still trying to block this out. In math we talked about charts and other sea crap. All day everyday was torture.,0
But this film is static. It should have been 65 minutes. He had the most dramatic potential. It's boring.,0
IT IS So Sad.,0
But clearly worth 98 cents. For slasher film mavens only. I thought so.,0
The intro is seeing Bernie killing his first victims.,0
"Finally, there is the matter of the inane title. It needed to be more like "" The Good Earth "", released just the year before. A story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldn't seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time.

Lowe is quite obnoxious. The cast is more impressive than movie. Coming of age is not so damn easy.,0
That was it.,0
It must have just been one whole joke to them on set. It really is that offensive to the genre. Why was this garbage even made? Who can really relate to this?,0
"The Cheating Bastard cheats until it is time for him to get caught. The Gorgeous Slut hides really soulful, deep pain with a wild lifestyle. The cherry was after two BFF he actually is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows. There really was no growth, no forward movement at all.",0

Schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment.",0
Twenty years later the film is still awful.,0
Perhaps it was the disorganized storyline.,0
"Heather Graham couldn't play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. the ABSOLUTE WORST, most UNREALISTIC movie i've seen in as long as i can remember. Who do the producers of the movie think they are?",0

"The character was played in affected and annoying way. I especially mean the role of H. Graham. OH MY GOD.. Though, maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable.",0

"Open your eyes, people, please! Bleh. And so many like it. Right the first time : the producers of this movie.",0
Not only was there no chemistry it just doesn't make sense. Let's look at the problems in direction / script. The word comedy was very hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these words are used.

"It is never explained how they got out of Bloomingdale's bridal salon with out a $ 10, 000 mocha colored gown. In the next week Charlie and Gray are off shopping for wedding gowns ( apparently Charlie has an off - the - rack figure ). Gray remembers everything ; Charlie remembers nada. When she signals her brother to come over they start a 3 - way date. In one week Charlie, Gray and Sam are to be in Vegas. Back to'reality'Caesar's palace Las Vegas. That Charlie accepts!

Could have been better. I wish I'd known more about this movie when I rented it.,0

"Then, the film took an awkward tone and got all serious. Unfortunately, she failed miserably. Their relationship just didn't feel very natural. Heather Graham gave the only good performance in the movie. Also, it seemed like she was reading her lines. Thomas Cavanagh was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion. Nothing about it felt real and everything was very cheesy.",0
If there has ever been a worse comedy than'Gray Matters'I am unaware of it. Molly Shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen insouciance.,0
"Better luck next time, hope Miss Graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like From Hell.",0

"My family and I screened Underdog the night before. Who knows. If I were you, I would take a pass.",0
"Instead, it ended up being forced, awkward and weird. The only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners. < br / > < br / > Thank gosh I didn't pay for.",0
'Schindler's List'was funnier ( and felt shorter ).,0
"And if that's disappointing, pull a chair, hide your face in your hands, and brace yourself for the real blow : he IS the film's humor! To Huh? In fact, the movie's blatant desperation to be compared to'Napoleon Dynamite'is scornful and offensive, and left me ticked off, instead of just being annoyed.",0
"CIA now send their best agents, a team of ( Swedish? ) You can't see what is happening. Ninjas to thwart KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter. Enjoy it, and then forget it.

Otherwise. The story was bad.,0

All these new comedies are just horrible. And Will Arnetts character is just plain bad. Make something new for once. 00 to see that piece of crap!,0
"also, the editing was really lacking. the part where he falls down the mountain had me yawning.",0
I knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once. This is only the 4th movie I've seen that I've felt compelled to rate 1 / 10. I didn't so much as smirk.,0

Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with Harris.,0
"Perfectly made, if you wouldn t know better.... And children or non guilty bystanders are never harmed, when the professionals execute.",0
"Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, I mean it's only a film after all but it's a film which is However while trying to do so he catches a pregnant female & injuries it to the extent she aborts her unborn foetus on deck which makes a mess & enrages her mate, Nolan orders the Whale be dumped back in the sea which is what happens. The script by producer Luciano Vincenzoni & Sergio Donati is so stupid I'm lost for words, the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously doesn't help & if I have to listen to Charlotte Rampling go on about how intelligent Killer Whale's are just one more time I'll scream.",0
"I couldn't stand to watch this movie again. < br / > < br / > My Rating : 3. The music is overdone and very loud, drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times. Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after Jaws?",0

This movie is really wack.,0
It also states that people don't need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community do destroy predators that harm them. It states clearly that if you try to take on a gang alone then they'll come back to your home and hurt you. The movie began well enough.,0

Whoever played the town sheriff was awful also. I'm a part of neither religion ( I'm actually an atheist ), but this offended me, along with another countless amount of Baptists most likely. Baptists at Our Barbecue'is the best film ever made. Although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film, it is full of clichés.",0
The acting is not bad but not special.,0
There was no chemistry among any of cast members. This movie was awful.,0
The acting is mediocre. I would recommend both movies over this groaner. Movie about a small town with equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists.,0

"A better actor than he ever got the credit for when given the right material, here's he's given less a properly thought out character than a series of outrageous reactionary quirks. It's almost as if someone ran a competition to make the sleaziest, seediest Cannon film.

< br / > < br / > Still there is a very rough justice in the end for Fernandez. This was the last film of the Bronson - Thompson team and J. Lee Thompson's last as a director. Unfortunately Kinjite : Forbidden Subjects falls in the latter. I wish the whole film had been better though.,0
"Now that I've seen it, I understand why they never became stars in movie musicals. My rating for this one : just 4 out of 10, and I'll stick with Block and Sully. Finally, Fields and Seely rush in and start performing. They both have plenty of pep, and she's fairly attractive. Offstage, though, there was a major difference in the couples'living arrangements.",0
"John Carradine is good in his scene, but other then that he's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes. ( Carradine Ruled!! ). The Acting is just as bad. BOMB out of 5 Carl Monson does an absolutely terrible! Merry Anders overacts here terribly as Laura, as she didn't convince me at all.",0
I thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought. It was one of those talk talk talk and bore me to death types. She had sold it years ago in a yard sale I am guessing - who knows. Don't watch this people unless you're hard up.,0

This is just awful.,0
A generous 4 out of 10. Unfortunately this film is almost bloodless.,0
So I bought me a copy. So you have to watch clearly to see the gore. It was made by a grindhouse cinema owner for an extreme low budget. The make up is for that kind of flick well done.,0
This is best avoided. The death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there. The rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes.,0
Terrible... just terrible. The rest of the flick gives you brain damage.,0

"It won't work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings. I ask myself how Schell could get the part of Hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play Hamlet a second time. Alas, that's on a stage, in a theatre.

"There's really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis. A 3 / 10 sounds about right to me. And this wrist - slitter is far from entertaining.

"Isabelle Huppert's creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time. There is some very good camera work and lighting is excellent. At the three quarters mark I had figured it out. However, I largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film - viewing experience.

The rest was a waist of my life. The part I'm speaking of is a lonely TOWNIE who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse. It seems confused in what it wants to be. That was the ONLY part of the movie that gave me ANY feeling. It made me sick.,0
( Though I didn't see the cleansing coming ). The strange people living in a town go about their lives. The monochrome takes edge off the two steps up from home movie feel.,0
"Alas, it just didn't work for me, and by the end of the film I was quite disappointed. He never grabbed me at all. Aside from Lugosi's performance, though, I found little to hold my interest.

But watching this film almost put me off her. A true angel. This is absolutely awful! It looked hilarious. I'd kick his ass.,0
I won't belabor the story as it's really not worth it. The worst by far was Holland Taylor as the Defense Attourney. She bored me to the hilt. Too bad. She's not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife. I couldn't believe this terrible movie was actually made at all. Let's not have anymore painful watching films like this.,0

It's also unnecessarily complex, as is the plot in general. I recommend this to huge fans of the series only.

"Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films. But really, this film doesn't have much of a plot. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema.",0

"I just kept thinking.. who cares??? I also found the acting to be rather dead pan and the dialogue strained. No one seemed to have any emotion throughout most of the film except during melodramatic events. I didn't exactly dislike Jake, but he seemed a bit too... spineless, I guess. And Sue Lee was all right.",0
"It really was too long. A young villian / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs much angst and violence against him, but, we never know why. < br / > < br / > The historical detail was excellent. I am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film.",0
"So cliché. The family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film, and once defined, the family is divided - the younger generation off to America. Not to mention the movie was in English! The'special'visual effects were confusing and distracting.",0

"It's nothing. All I could think of while watching this movie was B - grade slop. To think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by'Loaded'is vile. This film, however, is a void.",0
"My regards go to the cameraman, at least he tried to make something out of it. It is a pity that the film is edited lousy, if not, some scenes were certainly more credible. Honestly, I must admit that before I saw it I had some serious doubts. This film should have never been made.",0

"But for whatever reason, there wasn't much there. I think While there were hints of substance in the movie, it mostly didn't rise above the level of kiddie cartoon. She seems to promptly forget him.

Maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book, or it lost a lot in the dubbed version. ( Henderson's death is no spoiler ; his name isn't revealed until his death scene. )",0

Annie Galipeau, as Pony, just fails to be convincing, unfortunately, because I really wanted to believe in her. It is about the wilds of the Canadian wilderness. But the film is not about aunts. He makes her look vulnerable, which of course she is.. but in the wrong sort of way. James Bond in the wilderness?",0

Swayze doesn't make a very convincing Alan Quatermain.,0

This is the worst imaginable crap. The novel by H. Rider Haggard is very entertaining and dramatic.,0
"< br / > < br / > General : it is mwah - entertaining on rainy day. Pity. I like Swayze but in this he's awful. Your frock was a clue, Alison. Could have been better.",0
It is a bit creepy but good. Pathetic. It gives background to story of Quatermain.,0
The movie is an extra - long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventure's spirit.,0
I guess they learned after this movie. Two of those things were singing and dancing.,0
The horribly fake Texas accents is what kills it for me. It just doesn't work. John Travolta should have stuck to disco - dancing or 50s.,0
"Because he was charming. I mean, OK, it's interesting to look, but is it real? < br / > < br / > I've seen this series and found it awful. Third, people will hate me but it's true : Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly?",0

"It is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into Hilter's character don't feature him at all. This cowardice and self - censorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series, and is ultimately responsible for its failure.",0
"No crumbling plaster! Oh sorry, it is the Czech capitol and it is 2003, how funny. < br / > < br / > This is one of the most awful history movies in the nearest past.

"But again ; why the hell did they plain LIE to the public? To warn us? What I can't understand is why they pictured Hitler as a 100 % pure evil, mad, unreliable, mentally unstable freak. All true. Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating 2nd World War. But why in heaven's name portray him in this way?",0
"Not one. < br / > < br / > One scene shows Hitler beating his dog. He was also a vegetarian. A horrible joke of a film, I cringed throughout. Hitler loved animals above people.",0
"Hitler was evil! Give me a break. Simply put, this is a simplistic and one dimensional film. Instead, it basically just says, "" Hey! The great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of character.",0
Actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities.,0
< br / > < br / > I don't no where to start with. The first one was of course the legendary Galigula.,0
"Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but to cast him as Hitler is just plain wrong. A J - W playing a Nazi supporter, bad bad bad casting. It was good and made more sense then this baloney. This was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background.",0
"With Valentine's Day approaching, the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom. The villain is omniscient and nigh - invulnerable.

People! And its a German movie. imdb.,0
"- I don't think so. This could well be the worst film I've ever seen. They were in fact, second cousins. How then, if Hitler was only person to survive the scene, did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told? Did Hitler himself go around "" boasting "" about it?",0
By portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable. Why did people follow him to death? < br / > < br / > I pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show. Carlyle and the producers didn't get anything right with this.,0
Forgive me for asking but haven ` t the writers confused Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana from SCARFACE? Hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm.,0
"He had a more or less normal upbringing. The ones behind this movie should have made some research before making this. Because it seems as if they didn't even know what really happened. His upbringing in this movie is also inaccurate, Hitler as a child wasn't a disturbed little brat. Hitler wasn't as impossible and unstable as he is portrait - ed here. But this is however not the case here. It was however during world war one and after that he formed his views about the Jews.",0
"We needed more incidents. "" Are they totally nuts?

There was WAY too much gunplay. New kids on block, as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe. The central plot didn't reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series. Sadly, the Klingons landed on our doorstep instead of us finding them. Don't just hint about it, SHOW it! Instead of isolated references to the newness of exploration, they could have been the story. Get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it ( oh, for a TV show that once again would make us THINK ). There is still potential for the series, however. I liked the introduction.

"Poor Bakula. Just check the ratings. He's a great actor, as are the entire cast.",0
It barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981. The rest of cast has such small roles that it's impossible to get any dimensions from them.,0
Plot? How's about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something. Scares?,0
The acting is OK but not great. Difficult to call The Grudge a horror movie.,0
Such is the case with Columbia Pictures'' The Grudge. Sure there is! My guess is Bill Pullman got this job because of his kids begged him for a trip to Tokyo Disneyland. About 30 minutes into movie we finally see its American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Is there anything scarier than a creepy 8 year old Japanese boy? ( Remember Speed Racer? ),0

Akshay Kumar who is also an emerging star did quite a poor job. Do not waste your time with this movie. Period. I am an Indian and I am utterly shameful of Bollywood for producing this piece of thrash. Is that what you call acting? This is the reason why Bollywood is where it is.

"40 minutes into the first episode and I am still waiting for the suspense. it lacked any credibility and did not remotely ring true. < br / > < br / > Skip Five Daysthis. < br / > < br / > I then began looking for Journalists called "" Scoop "" and for Perry White to make an appearance. < br / > < br / > Head shakingly awful.",0
A complete dud.,0
"If you don't mind having your emotions toyed with, then you won't mind this movie. It's inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery. < br / > < br / > * In England, driving is on the left. On the other hand, if you enjoy British crime mysteries, following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end, you'll be very disappointed. This is a critical piece of the mystery. < br / > < br / > * Search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children ; this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting.",0
"What a let down! The last episode was dull, dull, dull. My advice : watch paint dry instead.",0
Scooby and Shaggy just aren't!!!!! Why change a winning format. trust me.,0
"However, Kasem DOES voice Shaggy's Uncle Albert, which is a sort of good thing. Believe me, the voice is REALLY BAD! Shaggy and Scooby - Doo have become more brave, too. Scooby - Doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. ) still hasn't improved.",0
Let's hope Get a clue will be apropos with reference to producers. I'm sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but I'm sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost. < br / > < br / > Scrappy Doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this.,0
"First of all, I hated the animation. show. Even some shows I really hate had slightly better animation.",0
! It's like watching a much - loved relative in the final throws of a degenerative illness!! Shaggy & Scooby - Doo Get a Clue.,0
"I've been a fan of Scooby Doo ever since the series premiered in 1969. What's New Scooby Doo was better than this. The entire cast of characters, and quality animation.",0
Rating * out of * * * * * * * * * *.,0
They even tried to do some lame punk thing with the theme song.,0
Wrong. In many ways Fred is the antithesis to Shaggy.,0
"Evolve or die, as saying goes. Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. I like it, but it's not real Scooby - Doo type animation. Besides, I am trying not to be an inflexible, nitpicking fan.",0
"The first episode of this new show was on today, and it was horrible. How can anyone take Scooby Doo and make THIS?",0
"A low - budget, straight - to - video movie will not have that same effect. And it didn't. < br / > < br / > As I watched the opening 15 - 20 minutes of the film, my expectations actually rose. There seemed to be at least SOME production value. When the adults were on screen, it had a more mature feel.",0
"Isn't that amazing? Please! Oh, and "" tooth - fairy "" was lame. Who gives money for such crap movies?",0
Go figure. This movie has one redeeming feature. But this doesn't make up for the deficiencies. At least it sets a mood.,0
they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on darkness falls. it was a big let down.,0
I think the movie would've been fine without them. Where to begin.,0
Dialog is fair but cheesy. Camera work is good.,0
"< br / > < br / > Other action logic deficits abound. Wow. I tried to finish this film three times, but it's god awful.",0
"Decent death scenes, though.",0
The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel. < br / > < br / > Half of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion. The story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch.,0
"better than this movie deserves. it's also slow and fairly predictable. in fact they look kinda cheap. there's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity's sake. once you watch the movie, you'll know what i mean. it just wasn't necessary at all.",0
"And this is not the worst part of this awful mess, the climax is. Let's see. The opening is filmed poorly, and like the rest of the movie, it's certainly not scary. She steals a bike, so apparently she's a thief too. In present time, the movie is about Peter ( Lochlyn Munroe ).",0
"First question would be, who the heck is the target audience for this? The UK gets a Phantasm Box Set, we get "" The Tooth Fairy "". Hardly seems fair. The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone, anyone, go after them with farm implements of SOME kind.",0
o'd!!!,0
"This work on the inn, has awoken the'Tooth Fairy '. Don't they just love turning happy childhood memories into nightmares! They called her the'Tooth Fairy'as she would kill kids after getting their last baby tooth. The promising opening scene is creepily effective.",0
Why has she come back as a ghost?,0
"If Harlequin Romance decided to do horror films, this would be good effort. I just can't say anymore. Thank God for fast forward! There is MUCH BETTER fare out there.",0
This movie is flawed on many fronts.,0
Yawn. I had expected more of him. This film is deeply disappointing.,0
Someone blind anyway ) apparently narrating from outer space (? ) Avoid at all costs. This really doesn't do the blues justice.,0
Four black and one Asian. Stacey Dash and Lisa Raye have been in better projects. We can shoot it for less than 15 million.,0
Be honest.,0
This by far the worst western on the planet today. Come on! First off there black people in the wild west?,0
Bad acting. The appeal black cowboy movies just isn't there.,0
"Couldn't have been too much of that where this movie is concerned. Just one more thing though, where was Ice T? I though it was him talking. The "" Gangster Bangster "" I guess.",0
Pathetic is the word. These too gals carried the whole movie.,0
"? Hmm, Hip Hop music to a period western.",0
Anybody catch cannon sequence? Come on!,0
"I should have known when I looked at the box in the video store and saw Lisa Raye - to me, she's the female Ernie Hudson A. K. A. "" Le Kiss of Death "" for * ANY * movie.",0
Sistas in da hood.,0
"Who? Very robotic,hearsed.",0
"Orginality, especially with an all African woman cast and an oriental cowgirl. Oh yeah!!!! Don't put down Stacy Dash. Oh, come on people give this film a break. When John Wayne came and shot up the the bad guys. That might be a western first. Sorry, still thinking. Oh yeah, the chick that was from Clueless was in it.",0
Hip - Hop and old westerns just don't seem to mix. An absolute steaming pile of cow dung. It's mind - blowing to me that this film was even made.,0
"The entire movie was crap. For instance, - Stacey Dash and the hanging scene. Ms. This type of not did not strangle the person, it killed them at the end of the drop.",0
Must have to agree with the other reviewer. Don't waste your time. Luckily I saw this on free TV. And the ending?,0
The plot barely made any sense. But the casting was great in my opinion.,0
"Alright, I got passed the horrible acting. < br / > < br / > I'm through.",0
The women cannot act. lo. This movie sucks!!!,0
Hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this lousy. This has the look and feel of a bad student film ( and the budget didn't seem to be a whole lot more ). Skip it.,0
"And lead actor is, for all intents and purposes, AWFUL. It's so bad, it almost HURTS.",0
"That doesn't mean it has no action, but look on the dark side of the picture. Besides, I've never heard of guy, so who needs his attention?",0
"Anyhow, this movie is basically worthless, the writing is sub par and the action, when there is some, is very lame. When Jake Speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen, which he is often not, he's seriously relaxing.",0
"Elsewhere, Max Von Sydow briefly appears in a few episodes, being rewarded with the show's most impressive and genuinely moving scene here he encounters a child as he attempts to leave Rome. < br / > < br / > Not a trip I can particularly recommend, I'm afraid, but if you do embark on it it's one not entirely without its small rewards.",0
Don't buy it! And that was highlight.,0
Skip this one and find the one that stars Doris Day. At least you get some real comedy professional style dancing! He was mistaken. She was improbably popular in Britain before and after WWII.,0
"Not a chance. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed that revival, he rewrote the book extensively. Three songs from the play remain, and are done very poorly.",0
"For what it's worth, the DVD can be had for $ 1. 00. Anna Neagle is extremely vapid as Nanette.",0
When will you learn? Silly rabbit / girl with your feather rabbit ears on your hat. Doesn't she realize that that piece was his immortality? But of coarse from the soundtrack I had no idea what the film was about.,0
"The murderess, Holmes and Watson, escape scot free. For a good reason! Holmes bumbles along fifty yards behind the plot.",0
You can see the plot points a mile away.,0
"But the sound effects of the shoot - out were pretty bad. I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. < br / > < br / > I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the film viewable.",0
The script is unbelievable. Avoid this movie.,0
"Apparently, because of the way the promotional process and the film festival circuit work. Ample enticements no doubt. < br / > < br / > Festival blurbs aimed at promotion sometimes goose it up a lot. It must have been a bad year ; they've had much, much better ones. Beautiful multicolored people, tropical weather, lush rhythms, and a hip gangster plot? Well... and it's Brazilian, "" I added. It's about a hit man, "" my friend said. """,0
"I checked back a while later ( it was showing on TV ), and it hadn't gotten any better.",0
"There is much to admire here, but at the end I found that all I could do was admire. I love Dark sci - fi thrillers. Renaissance has shadow and light, but little else. With real actors, perhaps the world of the film would not have felt so lifeless.",0
It is a Lifetime movie. What else? < br / > < br / > It wasn't all bad. Kicks him in the testicles. < br / > < br / > The female cast is right out of Desperate Housewives.,0
Ending was different too.,0
One reason could be problems designing'the house '. The book was copyrighted in 1978.,0
What was that about? Yawn. The cast is OK. The angles are trying way to hard.,0
The best thing about the movie was the house which serves as setting.,0
"as the owner of the house next door. This is not an entirely bad movie. They look so out of place on her face! I kept staring at them. The various characters who live in the house were also fine. Her husband, Walker ( Colin Ferguson ) is appropriately wooden.",0
It is no clever. Life is short.,0
I can't believe I watched the whole thing.,0
"This movie is pure guano. < br / > < br / > RUN! DON'T WALK AWAY FROM "" MYSTERY MEN!",0
"Life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers. Most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments. There are many worse films appearing as DVD's these days, and frankly I don't care much what happens either way. Such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for ; but to be effective they must also be entertaining.",0
"It was ultra high - tech for it's time. I do, however, love theme music. I remember loving this show when I was a kid.",0
And it didn't stay in production very long. The only chopper that was ever faster was experimental Lockheed AH56A in the 1960's.,0
Not for one second did she ever have one thought of concern for her husband! After having a one night stand with a slimy psycho she is being stalked by him. He is OBVIOUSLY crazy and very dangerous.,0
"). But, what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical. And, shame on Lifetime TV for insulting intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering.",0
"This ne'er - do - well proceeds to stalk Olivia and thus make her life a living - hell. When will Blockbuster adopt the "" Adultry "" section? The true culprit, when trying to decipher why this film was a dud, is William Riead. The man's dialogue is sophomoric and moronic. I have placed Rie She has a love scene with Anthony John Denison and also has a shower scene - shot at a distance ).",0
Iberia is nice to see on TV. And time to time it's look really good. Lot of dance and music. But why see this in silver screen?,0

The contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the ladies for "" a last dance "" and they all shake it some more.",0
It sucks a * *.,0
"Well, probably for the same reason most other people didn't... out of sheer optimism. What a disappointment! My chief complaint was that the set was so dark. So, why didn't I just switch the channel? Watching it left me feeling depressed.",0
"Suspense is usually put to good use. The random dancing is filler that actually feels like filler. < br / > < br / > Show Me The Money, on the other hand, is just too slow - paced. It either needs major changes or early retirement.",0

"It would be a lot quicker simply to start with "" A. "" Contestants can pass on questions, but must answer one of the three questions in each category. Does this serve any purpose other than to slow the game down? My suspicion is that the possibility of sudden disaster is the show's chief audience appeal.",0
"This is even worse, if that'possible. And you thought Rohmer was deadly.",0
"This one has already pretty much reached this point. But it is a hoot to watch William Shatner "" cavort "" and "" dance "" ( yes, the "" "" marks on the word dance are necessary for what Bill does ). < br / > < br / > But I suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long. But the guy is funny. The comment by "" eliz7212 - 1 "" hits the proverbial "" nail on the head "" for this turkey of a program.",0

"Neither dramatic, nor suspenseful. < br / > < br > Thank you. That was being generous, I know.",0
"< br / > < br / > This is horrible movie making. Lommel claims to have written this, if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. A total waste of even digital "" film "".",0

"If I could give it a zero, I'd change my mind and give it a - 10 instead. ! Just PLAIN BORING. Zodiac killer should be called'Boria killer'instead!!",0
"With a level of misogyny that is pretty awful. They are talking, with pride, about all the murders they have committed and chant. Why would anyone want to see this?! Why, I don't know - - perhaps because they people made this got off on this sort of crap. However, I should warn you that there are a few scenes that are still pretty disturbing. As I said, it has a definite made directly to video look about it. The film is filled with lots of corpses and blood. It's all very funny, though I am not sure that was the scene's purpose. While they tried to act like Sad... and very pathetic, actually. I might have also congratulated his family and friends for doing a good job acting.",0
Aside from that the plot is unrealistic. I've seen better acting in a 4th grade play. This movie was almost intolerable to sit through. If the man suspected the guy he would have turned him in.,0
"Well, as Goethe once said, there really isn't any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on "" something that has had a great effect "". "" La Maman et La Putain "" has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what's been done in France and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film, certainly, should be dissuaded from watching it.",0

For those of you who don't know, DS I was also diagnosed with DSM - IV and have since recovered "", etc. None of the Haarman facts are correct either, just a bunch of jumbled nonsense. I think that the writer / director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. "" Ooh those sound like cool names, let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research! This is easily the worst movie i have EVER seen. great idea! """,0
"I don't know why. That's what is looked like they were doing. There was also a random allusion to 9 / 11 for no reason. Because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun, pretty or romantic. "" The acting was worse than me reading straight from a script. com.",0
Zodiac Killer. Sign me up. Worst acting ever. Uh - huh. No post production either. No the one from the seventies. One would be hard pressed to find a home movie participant with such an awkward camera presence.,0
"I wonder if she has seen this? Awful, awful, awful.",0
"Well, yes. This movie is bad. Apparently they do... and the guilty man is writer / director Ulli Lommel. Be advised.",0
thought it was a joke before the actual movie. this movie had not actual facts about the real Zodiac killer. 1 out of 10.,0
It is not even good enough to be called a B rated movie. Do not waste your money or your time on this movie. I literary asked for a refund.,0
00. It's just bad.,0
"The story and acting are atrocious! David Hess, you have let me down too. 1 is being pretty generous here. It creeped me out.",0
"Usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it. Through out I would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained. ! P. S. I don't even think this deserves star... not even a half. In all honesty, my guess is the cover to the DVD case cost more than the entire movie.",0
She fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband's corpse. Not one of the show's highlights.,0
"Therein lies the primary trouble with ZODIAC KILLER. It does not feel like watching a movie. And lucky us, he wrote script too! on video. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Please, please miss this film. He ought to know better. You'll thank me later.",0
This was by far one of the worst. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the martian man hunter. As there was nothing wrong with the acting etc etc the writing for the episode is way off for this series phantom or no phantom.,0
I can't understand any high ratings for this at all. This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film. It'quite bad.,0
it made him look like Jim Varney. < br / > < br / > Watch the original.,0
"On the small screen, it's just another version of Law and Order spin - offs. This is the first problem with the TV remake - - color changes the tone of the story. At the end of the TV version, we are left with the feeling : "" Ho hum, who cares? "" In Cold Blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry. The directing doesn't get in the way. The script is OK. < br / > < br / > All of the actors are competent.",0
Let this turkey die quick death. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? The original said it all and still holds up.,0
The second is All in Good Time. Three what?,0
I can find very little thats good to say about this film.,0
"A call - girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer's next target. The explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of Hitchcock, not an homage.",0
Why? Is it the end of the world? The last wave? Was the world that bad a place? From wave?,0
The plot is absurd and tired.,0
"Worse, it ain't funny. The beginning of the end. < br / > < br / > From the beginning to the end this film offends. The only film I've ever walked out on. < br / > < br / > Sexual Olympics?",0
Hardly. Precursor jokes? Give it a break because it was early 70s? Retro? There had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior. Seminal comedy? The only way I could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint.,0
"Yeah, Chevy Chase is in this but maybe of all < br / > < br / > about 1 or 2 minutes.",0
"Oh dear. It seriously is very, very bad. Avoid even if curious.",0
"Some skits were just retarded. No problem. < br / > < br / > IMHO : Ken Shapiro s best movie is STILL "" Modern Problems "" Rented it last night. The opening ( 2001 ) ran WAAAAAAAAAY too long. The hitchiker scene served no purpose.",0
And done way better.,0
"And man, that's BAD. < br / > < br / > This film isn't even "" good "" bad or "" enjoyable "" bad. < br / > < br / > A man named Ken Shapiro made this film. Films like that you can actually watch and get a kick out of.",0
It was neither great nor inspirational. Thumbs Down.,0
It was from a dildo and it was in slow - mo. The jury is still out on this. < br / > < br / > My soul felt chafed after this movie. Yep. This is correct to bash the film.,0
Everything else about this film is extremely amateur.,0

She looked gorgeous. I had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on Danish television yesterday.,0
I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie. Also the writer kept throwing in way too much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love. < br / > < br / > A serious waste of time. I figured that you really couldn't go wrong with a concept of Ex Girlfriend with super powers.,0

It was almost painful. < br / > < br / > When Uma insults Anna Faris, calling her a "" whore "" I had no debate with that.",0
I just had to get home and see if paint dried a darker shade than when it went on. Fairly lame special effects.,0
I actually cant believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film... it was THAT bad!!! I honestly wished id never watched it and I strongly warn everyone against seeing this film. This film heavily relied on its special effects... but they personally had no effect on me. It is a total waste of money and you'll only end up being disappointed afterwards.,0
"Let's see if Jason Reitman can salvage family name. This is a comedy, right? But the pay - off is just not there.",0
This movie should be called Ramone Fever. What kind of high school is this anyway?,0

"The female actresses are very cute, and that's the only reason to watch this movie. What we get is them sobbing and crying and fighting and so on over 2 guys that were best described in Friday 13th 4.",0
This movie is about 90 minutes too long. What a waste of time and money! The special effects..... aren't. WRONG!,0
"I feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box office. That was the last time the movie was funny, and when was that scene? At what point exactly does a good movie go bad? Ten minutes into the flick? Hey, Rainn Wilson! * OFF switch ""?",0
This movie was truly god - awful. if they gave me the option of negative numbers I'd use it.,0
This is one of the worst movies I have seen recently. This could have been really funny because concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here.,0
"Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. Girlfriend "" is an exercise in pointlessness. The one - trick pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The film can't decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama.",0
Don Payne did an awful job with the screenplay. < br / > < br / > A few of actors were good enough to save the film. < br / > < br / > Director Ivan Reitman has lost his touch. Uma Thurman was great as G - Girl and she had many funny lines. Wanda Sykes is either hit or miss for me. What went wrong?,0
This spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show. The dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera. The story is bad. What an awful show.,0
"That's all. Yay, there is a spin - off show! I was really excited.",0
This movie is terrible.,0
They had a good thing there. The Syfi channel really destroyed their Friday night lineup.,0

Lazy writing. The actors?,0
"These kids are definitely not from this planet. I doubt I'll be watching this space soap when it premieres on the Sci - Fi channel. Overall this movie was bland & unoriginal & cheap looking, using recycled CGI of Caprica from BSG. This prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it. No surprise there! The virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous & unbelievable. Caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror film.",0
Caprica has lots of this. Very boring prequel to the main series. Directors / writers who do this should be banned from the business.,0

This movie was terrible. everything seemed fake.,0
"However, this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light.",0
Verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat. The audience is soon caught in a deep torpor. Its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way.,0

We see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there's no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured. How bad is it? You can see join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage! Which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute America's men in uniform. STARLIFT, you see, is set largely at Travis Air Force base in California in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in Korea.

Bad in every way. Nuff Said. Terrible movie. Total unnecessary.,0
One of my best friends brought this movie over one night with the words'Wanna watch the worst horror movie ever? ). 'I always enjoy a good laugh at a bad horror flick and said yes.,0

"This was made in 2005, but they all look so naieve it smacks of just pre - grunge era. Instead they figured mediocrity would be good enough. And the main character Neal guy, what a pathetic looser. Well it tried to, but really fails. IF you have these limits in making a film, how could the lighting be so bad? And that music video, wow that was bad, I fast fowarded through that.",0
Very strange!,0

Eh?,0

Of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications.,0

"You can count me out of this one, Mr. Cameron!",0
< br / > < br / > 4 / 10. And the actors don't have an Italian accent.,0
Where can I complain? Randy Travis was really good in his role.,0
In my opinion this film is not worth watching. She does it in all her movies anyway. I saw this film recently in a film festival. The film - maker was by the door. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times.,0
At the end of movie you have more questions then answers. In the box of Wes Craven's New Nightmare I found this lame movie.,0
My final thought is why would Hooper want to make this movie. It's obvious this didn't work.,0
"Terrible, absolutely terrible.",0
You've got to see it for yourself. CRIPES. This is absolute genius.,0
"I feel sorry for Hooper, his career seems like it was over before it really ever got started. He did what he could. As for the movie itself? Pure drudge.",0
"Englund also plays de Sade in flashbacks, ranting in his cell. < br / > < br / > Score : 3 out of 10 Meanwhile, black hooded cult members decapitate, gouge out eyeballs and slit throats.",0
"That is pretty much it - I think it has something to with the Gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always and lead actress, Zoe Trilling, whilst not very talented, is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching Night Terrors is a chore. It is a plot less, incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment. It's not.",0
"Awful, simply awful.",0
"Zoe, I know where you are now ; hiding from this film!",0
It was SOO bad! Did she need the money that badly?,0
"Everyone else is Italian - American. Well, TiVo recorded this because of Angelina Jolie. The only movie I've ever seen that was worse than this was "" Hamburger : The Movie "". 5 stars. Or maybe "" Deadly Friend "". Even the men. It had 2.",0

I sincerely hope so. Now, being that in this movie, bodies don't seem to decay or possess a rather foul funk, Bernie is unaware of this.",0
Michael Caine ( Dr. Linderby ) is good as always. It'obvious bias and hatred of those people by a Jewish director.,0
"This sort of movie hardly adds gilding to a CV. But then again, probably he wouldn't. Though one suspects that most of the audience still went away disappointed. Definitely a serious goof - ball. It was later remade with equal panache staring Harrison Ford. Every taste in hero is catered for. Sometimes maybe actors should choose their director instead of the other way round.",0
This is as bad as it gets. Richard Fleischer directs but you get the impression it was over telephone.,0
). I found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin.,0

"Rex Harrison seems even less bothered, perhaps unsurprisingly, as his character is very poorly written.",0
"Instead, it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast, exotic locations, boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline. And weren't both of those films a good deal worse than Ashanti? Hold on, Michael, weren't you in The Swarm and Hurry Sundown? The film is based on a best - seller entitled Ebano, by the little - known author Alberto Vasquez - Figueroa, but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation. < br / > < br / > Along the way, big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles.",0
'Ghosts can't do it'is just that. The movie is a complete waste of time.,0

The story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something.,0

"). After all, sometimes when I watch a film again I like it much more and realize that I was a bit too harsh. Only PARNELL was obviously worse. This is one of the very worst films Clark Gable made. Best at producing unintended chuckles? But when she was sent to prison, it was all clichés until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred.",0
That is worth seeing.,0
Why did they bother?,0
I'd just like thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity. Heck if I know. Can William McNamara act?,0
No one in cast comes off too well ; with this lame script that's not surprising.,0

Raptor Planet lies in the latter. Their quality varies.",0
"This has to be one of the worst movies of all time. Hell, I'm still laughing.",0

"Horrible. Save your money! You would be better off watching paint dry. The acting, the music drowning out the actors.",0
"Absolutely pitiful. The only serial killer movie I would consider WORSE is that lame "" DAHMER "" movie. THAT'S IT. Whoever made that one needs be shot. Can just ANYBODY make movies these days?",0
How can a movie as this one ever be made.,0
This film is so bad it simply defies reality.,0
I'm not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this. Uwe Boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake. I like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths.,0
"I can honestly say, in all my years of film - going, this is the WORST. From start to finish, there was not one single highlight. ZERO out of TEN. MOVIE. EVER.",0

Don't even waste your time watching this for free. The events in this movie are not even close to the truth.,0
"There is nothing decent about this "" film "". Every shot was brutally unstable. Just plain awful. It was like they just decided one day to make a movie.",0

Needless to say, homelife is not so appealing. ). < br / > < br / > Nonetheless, the film is about a young girl who comes from a rather poor background. We saw this in Trashin'( a vert ramp joust ) and Rad ( BMX dancing at prom, although it wasn't much for competition, but rather for fun ) for example.",0
"Oh My God! Please, for the love of all that is holy, Do Not Watch This Movie! It Didn't.",0
I rented this horrible movie. The worst think I have ever seen. 49 too much.,0
whoever paid to have this film made is broke now. there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie.,0
I would give this movie ZERO stars if I could. It is like a bad student film.,0
"And that I have to reject. What this movie doesn't have is any drama, really. Stay away from this garbage. Unfortunately, the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage. All shot in a gray cold color. We then move on to seeing the BTK killer's youth as well as the present and his history of crimes. Sometimes you don't know's coming and don't have enough time to look away. There isn't much of an arc to this story.",0

No. When it was announced he was BTK, she was shocked.",0

It doesn't.,0

No continuity to the plot. Weird cuts and edits. This movie is just so awful.,0
"It's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie. My review doesn't do this film justice, because I can't describe how utterly horrid time I spent watching this was. I lost.",0
Cause i sure wouldn't waste the money on it myself again.,0
The acting was horrific. : ~ (.,0
And that's not saying a lot for that movie either.,0
This isn't even about the BTK killer. This is NOT retelling. THAT serial killer movie is accurate and true.,0
If I could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten. The case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price. Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one.,0

So Hanks took a role I wouldn't have expected him in, and he pulled it off well. 4 / 10 Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. The highlight of this movie for me was without doubt Tom Hanks. Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you like, admire and root for.",0
The content did not warrant the histrionic acting by Paul Newman. This is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing.,0

those are not the only weak parts of the movie. Gen is a total disappointment. he should be aware of the fact that he is not Hitchcock nor Shyamalan yet!!!! hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big industry! there were also a lot of preciosities in the film.,0
"< br / > < br / > In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. I really like the beginning of the movie. It could have been very scary indeed. I am sure he will improve.

Actings are okay.",0

"And in the end, you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary. Maybe I'm the only one, but it strained my eyes. Similar to Unleashed ( which was great, ) Dog Bite Dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master's bidding. < br / > < br / > The white balance seemed off throughout most of the film. The suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling. The main characters, an emotionally undeveloped, amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer, are far from the common heroes and villains we often see.",0

"I also enjoyed seeing Budapest as the movie was partly filmed there. The love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan kirckland was really stiff, almost icy.",0

Here his character has no discernible qualities, he's rude and obnoxious, and thinks he's funny when he frankly isn't. Not that he'd care, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends.

The plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome. < br / > < br / > The plot is weak and trite. This movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits ( the opera music ) hanging above the mud. Do we need to know? Pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice. His culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script.,0
"Wow, talk about romantic dialog!! This is definitely overstating it as well. < br / > < br / > Sadly, even the gorgeous music of Pavarotti couldn't save this film. Giving this a 10 is akin to giving Wally Cox the award for Mr. Universe or putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre!!! It is rare to see a movie with such clichéd dialog or goofy scenes like the food fight, but even they aren't the heart of the problem.",0

After that that agent must have referenced Star Wars a lot.",0
I don't blame her. I would feel ashamed to have this on a resume. Halfway through the film I was still looking for a plot. I made it through Battle Field Earth no problem.,0

Utterly painful from start to finish. Whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck. Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million dollar bust The New Line Cinema refused to put in theaters. The humor is on that level and Theodore Rex looks like the inbred cousin of Barney. I didn't see that when I watched this movie. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful.,0

"The Mother is the embodiment of the physical Universe as well, she is Nature. Reality and truth has a dark side as well as light, which serves a purpose.

The Mother takes on the frightening form of Kali Mata to destroy our inner demons, and to terrify our egos.",0

On top of that it stops me from comparing ZOMBI 3 to 28 DAYS LATER and its sequel. Not just that but the 28 franchise will appeal to a thinking audience who may have little interest in the average horror movie. I watched this immediately after seeing HILLSIDE CANNIBALS so anything would have been an improvement. All the production values scream that it's a low budget splatter flick from the very early part of that decade.,0

As for the mood throughout, it was extremely dull.",0

"Nothing really worth watching, nothing to remember. The choice of the principal actresses was awful.",0
"His charm, looks, and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable. This is an abysmal romantic comedy, one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen. Can anything be done to return Kate into heaven for good? Longoria is beautiful and funny as overbearing fiancé and Bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise infectious. No, its not the cast, as they try gamely to make things work. Biggs, a funny thespian, too, is totally wasted.",0
She was such a revolting person I was not even sorry for her. She is just plain annoying.,0
It's like she knows nothing about acting. It goes from point A to B with little surprise.,0
"Kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue. < br / > < br / > The main problem with the film is that the script just isn't very funny. Cary Grant was an angel in "" The Bishop's Wife "" ( 1947 ). That aptly described my situation throughout this film. Just to start out with, compounding her lack of comedic talent, she is covered with so much pancake makeup, who knows what she really looks like?",0

"Lake Bell is a complete miscast. Jason Biggs is wasted, so is Lindsay Sloane. Sadly, I didn't get entertained.",0
"So there's this bride, you see, and she gets crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on the day of her wedding. Polite chuckling.",0
Ashley is to contact Kate's spirit hoping to help Henry get on with his life. Still this movie was over - hyped. And Biggs as usual a pain in the butt. I personally thought that Bell stole the show from Parker.,0
"I figured just to go ahead and see the horror before my eyes, but actually this wasn't too bad. I think I may have found it to be a little better without her, just she does annoy me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable. < br / > < br / > Henry just lost his bride to be, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day.",0
Other than that it can be skipped completely. Eva as a ghost is pretty funny.,0
Avoid this movie at all costs. it really destroyed any faith I had left in dutch movie industry.,0

Then he takes the other to Italy at the behest of a Mr. Wilson, who rightly thinks that Joe Don will screw up big time. Joe Don Baker is... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, a pudgy, sweaty murderous oaf in a stupid cowboy suit that Roy Rogers would have laughed at. Then he gets taken by Palermo after he threatens a woman with a coat hanger. Until you want to blow your brains out with Joe Don's ivory handled pistol and be done with the horror.",0
"This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end movie ever. One thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in Malta. The movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Don's character.",0
"The ending is flawed and somewhat predictable, and I was happy was finally over. Anyway, if you're up for a laugh, then see this one on MST3K sometime. I guess nobody told him it was the 20th century. She must be insane! Plus, he shoots everybody like he's in the wild west. His partner actually slumps down twice in the movie. Very bad editing.",0
"Then Joe Don looks for Palermo, looses Palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the Malta chief of police, and then is let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more.

"I notice from the comments that most of the people discussing this movie are basing their remarks on the MST3K airing. Whether this scene was cut just for time or because it didn't provide much fodder for riffs, I don't know. While this does give her a motive for turning against him, the whole scenario is just really... icky. However, Joe Don himself is wearing his ridiculous cowboy - slash - sheriff outfit, complete with shiny badge! ( There's no other word for it. )",0
"It didn't really meditate on anything. Montano of course plays the hero of the movie. He said he wanted to make Visayan movies that could compete at Cannes and Toronto etc. His performance was embarrassing. But alas, I was short - changed.

In addition to this the voice talents don'thing remarkable, the music is nothing special. Instead of Bill Brown's music I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. There's plenty of blood and violence, but that does not impress me at all. To begin with the story - it's OK. So all in all - it lacks atmosphere. So they could add a little nudity and spice to it.",0
What was the point? It is quite a long scene.,0
"Witty. Tautou is in this film, don't get me wrong, but one could argue that she is not at the center of this story. He utterly, utterly fails.",0

"But overall, the execution wasn't at all cringe worthy. Avoid it. Even the final scene ( the eyeball thing ) isn't really that nasty. < br / > < br / > The idea of the movie is indeed demented. Not to mention the actress playing the victim might be one of the worst in history.",0
"Well it falls short here too. Which leaves two other reasons to possibly watch it. These are much better choices over this piece of crap The girl's reactions just seem dumb. this movie has no plot, no character development, and no budget.",0
It would have been funnier to use a real doll instead. is more frightening than this one.,0
Also the way the girl responds to all the torments is pretty tame. There is more moaning than screaming in this one though. Does it even have cinematic value really? Not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic really. However the movie is just all too fake for that to work out as intended.,0
"I really cannot figure why. It IS disturbing, I give it that. That's it. The girl who plays the victim isn't a very good actor, and reacts very calm to all the torture. This piece of crap doesn't have any point whatsoever.",0
"and just leaving the torture, it works on some levels. The truth is, I didn't find this film at all disturbing. The hot oil, maggots and innards just didn't bother me. She should be screaming like a banshee in pain. The truth is though, I don't rate it. As a disturbing piece of film though, it didn't work for me at least.",0

"But end was disappointing as well. She has to know somebody in the biz. Maybe if her acting had been better, I would have liked it. So, her voice has very little inflection.",0
Rain man would have been insulted. I don't care. And she's rich????,0
"If so, he failed. But this film NEVER pulls this off.",0
For a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is beyond belief. < br / > < br / > This wooden production left me cold.,0

What the heck was this. The final scene leaves whole thing ambiguous.,0
< br / > < br / > I would save yourself the embarrassment of knowing that you have watched'Haunted Boat'and find something that is more entertaining. It had no direction. A let down to its genre.,0
There was rock and opera during what is supposed to be suspenseful scenes. Even the cover of the DVD looked good. Whoever edited the film has no clue what they are doing. Another reason I was disappointed was the plot made no sense. If you like amateur student horror films you may like this. That would have been more interesting but it didn't happen.,0

"Want to know why it's not on video and never shown on TV? < br / > < br / > The story is uninspired and really not credible. Stop, you're killing me. Someone here actually compared this movie in some ways to High Noon. I would almost bet Sinatra paid someone to deep six thing as much as possible. 'Stand up for yourself!",0
"In a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern, to break away from it the film has to be very good. Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns.",0

But I'll say this for Carruthers : she's cute. ( Well, give or take. ) After all, it must have been filmed on a REAL movie set.",0

Could it be less frightening? < br / > < br / > Over lit perhaps? But that doesn't redeem the film at all. Perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better. There are some shock factors though, and a couple of gross scenes. Just not as smooth as one is used to. That is never a good look. < br / > < br / > The storyline is flimsy. It went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less. But I am not convinced.",0

"But you know what, I found it a cheesy delight. Hey, I enjoy those films, but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses. Yeah, It's gawd awful and highly forgettable, but it's a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted. < br / > < br / > Look what'Scream'started! From this it's labelled as a cursed production.",0
"I say that because, that would mean the torture would have lasted longer. I made the wrong decision. Many points were left connected with no thought at all. That is if you want to call this a story.",0

I watched an episode. Maybe it's lack of believable foils.,0

In fact the screenplay doesn't make sense ; imagine a 60 min. The subject - matter and environment could have been good.,0

I found this movie hard to believe.,0
"Michael Rooker CAN act. Wrong again. Has it come to this? There are so many awful lines in this movie, I don't even want to have to remember any of them. It's almost like Harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said, they could improve the script. Turner's part is so small and pointless, but she still manages to appear lost on screen. That, my friends, is a script. It's his fault that I was never drawn into this movie at all, because he should have made people actually act.",0

"The couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes, which were dry and dull. Some parts were discontinuous altogether. Rock's first incarnation's couple of underlings were also bland. Not much of that in the movie. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls flat on its face.

"Listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie. The story was incoherent and effects were crude even for 1977. It's a bunch of trash. "" They were right.",0
The editing is really poor. You have been warned. This movie wasn't just bad - it was terrible.,0
Plenty. Bad effects? Stupid moments? Stupid characters?,0
The script is poorly written and the dialogue verges on just plane stupid. The climax to movie ( if there is one ) is absolutely laughable.,0
"No, not just burn up, but MELT! WHERE did they get money? < br / > < br / > Anyway, he gets all red & gooey, and the fact that he's melting makes him really mad. HOW long will it take for him to just melt away to nothing? Well OK maybe not that fast, but ya know what I mean.",0

"I see he's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling WWE. But "" you're fired "" or "" you're hired "", for how many seasons now?",0

Where do I start?,0
And Big Pussy? This is not reality but staged drama! Hmm... double episode crap?,0
The highlight for me was the world's slowly fistfight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the splashing waves. The film features tons of nudity and gore ( Tempra paint variety ) is there.,0
"Secondly, Mr Knightly is miscast. Firstly, Emma is too unpleasant. Finally, this dragged at the end.",0
No style. The script is nice.,0
"Therefore, she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book. But the acting was awful. The costumes are even more so. This is indeed a god adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. And again, I can see no feeling of happiness in face of Mr. Knightley.",0
"Mr Woodhouse's character in this adaptation just appears bizarre, rather than just quaint, elderly and a bit trying. Mr Knightley is the perfect man, and Emma is as close as you could get in those times to an independent, clever, confident woman - remember, she is only 21, and was sure to have matured and grown out of her flaws. < br / > < br / > Really horrible.

Horrible. DON'T SEE THIS FILM. A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. But what results is simply confusing.,0
"Where is the house? In the movie she was no more than some special lady. We all know a movie never does complete justice to the book, but this is exceptional.

"He just lost a huge amount of respect in my eyes. Although if people like Tarantino are the ones making the decisions I'm not holding my breath.

I have grown up reading Modesty Blaise, both the comics and the books, and she truly is a heroine to me.",0

They would make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old. Over 50 % of this film is stock from the original movie. Awful awful awful. added Film to its wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs. These scenes are shot through a filter so thick the characters glow. Don't watch this movie.,0
"Decisions, decisions. The acting is stiff at best. Also, if this has a 3 in the title, why is there no mention of what happened in II? Is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung? Ties to the original are botched. That's a laugh. Let's see... it has footage from'The Boogey Man'and, um... it's mercifully short. First of all, this movie is a total bore.

"Did you know that the definition of'time'isn't what we all think it is? Perhaps it's an intellectual & philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend? Yes, that must be it! The crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solar - powered house in the middle of nowhere. Or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as "" When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth "" and "" The Lost World ""?",0
There is a reason that the movies never go to theaters. I'm serious.,0
And it's really VERY unbelievable. Nice try. This movie really has no beginning or end.,0

Enslin reacts in a believable manner. But this movie had no scary moments. I felt no chill down my spine. He's freaked out. Good.,0

Why? < br / > < br / > The plot is just a stream of consciousness. When I first watched the show, the first few episodes seemed promising. The only thing that is constant is the sex.",0
"Somethings die for a reason, even vampires. Maybe this show should to.

Alan Ball's not so secret desires for Ryan ( Jason Stackhouse ) gives us a fresh nude shot each week although it often has nothing to do with the storyline.",0
"Someone even recommended the show to me. Along with his endless pursuit of tale, he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him. I really didn't care for Jason at all. After a few episodes, I wouldn't have minded if he got killed somehow. At other points, some of the developments happen too fast.",0
"It's shallow and extremely predictable. Uh.. The scene in which he gets arrested is just simply a shame to modern television. After watching some of HBO's great stuff - Band of Brothers, Rome, etc. Anna Paquin was okay as well, but not more. She throws a chain at the guy and ow!

Lucio Fulci was scrapping the bottom of the barrel here and it shows. Lack of cohesiveness runs rampant as does banality. Just a mish - mash of other FAR better sword & sorcery epics.,0
I was completely amazed at just how bad it was.,0

I think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it. Peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend Jack. The rest of the film is a bit of a blur really. They demand a huge ransom for her release. It has to be seen to be believed.,0
"It's not really clear if that's why he's so bitter or if it's about something else. "". < br / > < br / > The comment about the writers assuming you already know the characters was apt. A bit of a disappointing film, I'd say : the acting was stilted, somehow.",0

Where were the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? Not on the payroll apparently. Memoirs of a Geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time. Hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making.,0

It looked ridiculous. Necromancy has major flaws and is just out and out bad.

A VERY poor effort. She is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into another's soup.,0

"I mean, at least first film tried. Does this movie suck!",0
This one is pretty bad. The first movie is pretty good.,0
"Only Gavin's final seduction of her own brother really shocks. The line is funnier in England, where, away from Vixen! Personally, I preferred the haddock.",0

The movie is actually too slow. The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost. I believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring. Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music.,0

This film comes as the ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming - Liang for me. So I'm not going to analyse it thoroughly either.",0
"The Wayward Cloud is a frustrating film to watch. Ironically, for a film in which so little happens, the viewer would probably be proportionately rewarded by watching a second or even third time. Ambient noise is kept to a minimum and barely a word is spoken. Infuriatingly enigmatic, it treats each shot like a work of art. < br / > < br / > Had the content of this film not been as sexual as it is it would no doubt been even more obscure to Western audiences.",0

Then it was gay men getting the shortchange treatment, now we have the same thing with women.",0
Overall I find this movie is a disappointment. The acting certainly does not make it better.,0
"The backgrounds have overlapping colour and the buildings seem futuristic. and outfit and moves.

The likes of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectably okay. Oh that wasn't obvious planting. The messy script does get considerably silly. The soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes. No I don't mean virgins, it's the music company, as it does get in numerous shots and Helsing's daughter works there too.",0

"It's directed by Martin Kitrosser of Friday the 13th fame. Enjoy. The acting is very bad indeed, but the gore and special effects help make it interesting. This movie wasn't that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original. I liked it better than the Matrix!",0
"Why? The little target is a mute child named Derek ( William Thorne ) whose stepdad was murdered by a red ball with extending arms that ensnare his face, causing him to land on a fireplace poker. Rooney's name adds an allure to film, gaining it a notoriety, but his histrionics can only help so much. < br / > < br / > Pretty disappointing special effects and rather goofy premise.

Violent sexy Milligan at his most home made. ( though decidedly r rated ). Dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result.,0

"As we sat around watching these shows, we all speculated on what was going to happen. < br / > < br / > To me this show is just pumping itself off the commercials, with no real humor.",0
"To start with, the producers should have focused on fun things that would make cavemen different from us. So why does this show suck? Yawn! And, as noted previously, Neanderthals really are a different species, so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotyping is both uncompelling and off the mark.",0

"Obvious, childish, predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes. Well, more or less a fuzzy image of it. None of the gags really hits the point. The content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on Bohlen's sloppy idealized memory. The result was a funny book about his life.",0

It's like one long TOY commercial. No depth whatsoever.,0
WB had to mess this up with some tripe Batman of the Future. Its absolute rubbish! DC should sue.,0
It squeezes by my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the Batman name. Please! Warner Bros... rethink!,0
Not me anyway. The Batman shows him only in his karate days.,0
Since when were the Joker or the Penguin ever a match for Batman? The animation is awful and the dialog is terrible.,0
It's not Batman. Which it's not. They have ruined all the villains. wtf? or whatever.,0
And That's saying something.,0
"Batman follows. goes to arkham. EVEN PENGUIN! < br / > < br / > But hey, let's not forget the villains. The one that people praised? Yeah maybe, he was there last 6 times. None. < br / > < br / > Well clearly, Warner Bros. doesn't. he get's knocked out.",0
"Man - Bat is biggest example. In the comics, he's a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness. It looks like a cheap, crappy Japanese anime. He's also not a detective, just a fighter. Then again, just about every modern - day cartoon is like that. This version of Batman doesn't seem haunted by his parents'deaths and is not interesting at all.

"Grendel "" looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and the CG effects are terrible. Like I said, this movie is absolutely needless.",0
"< br / > < br / > Life is too short to watch this movie. It was like someone cut and pasted a scene from Robocop. I half expected Beowulf to say exclaim, "" I LIKE IT! "" Those things don't cost much.",0
This one is a mess!!! This was certainly not the powerful Beowulf of epic poem! And lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow? Beo - wimp is more like it. Pointless love interest? He was much too reliant on weapons.,0
100 mins. PG for mild language. This is a really dumb movie.,0
"They may not look as fancy but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jacksons early films. < br / > < br / > The script seemed confused to me. When the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro. In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets.",0
"What's wrong with being faithful to the text? The fight with Grendel was Beowulf vs. Grendel. That's it. There was no love story in the poem. Again, why couldn't they portray what really happened?",0
Arrows with explosive charges in 500AD? I suspect that any modern telling which doesn't make an intelligent attempt to penetrate the obscurity must fail. < br / > < br A monster Grendel that looks like a robocop and obviously never interacts with any of the weapons fired or swung against him? The effects are way too weak to carry this story. In this it feels more like an old cowboy western than any kind of myth. Anachronism? The ancient Danish court represented in Classical Greek style? The queen played by Marina Sirtis more savaged by her makeup artist than by madness? < br / > < br / > Beowulf is an ancient tale from an era with almost no literary tradition and much of both its sentiment and its drama is obscure.,0

"The gags are repetitive, childish and déjà - vu. As for story, it's just too much! Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad!",0
This movie has one good part... its END! No attention to camera or shots in mind. Its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it. How this pile got through no one can tell. No script since it was apparently written and added to daily. This film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion.,0

This was quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen.,0

It is a sight to behold. It is exquisitely wrapped. But the images are cold and emotionally sterile. The moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out.

He's barely in it. Rodney Dangerfield isn't the main character of this movie. Unfunny jokes. One running gag is that a character is named Jerk Off.,0
You're better off watching paint dry. Nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny. Check.,0

I hated it. This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy.,0

Rubbish? I have been searching for the right words to describe this film.,0
"The whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp, "" what? "" Junebug. Georgia Rule has got to be one of - if not the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.",0
"Afterward, I just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were "" moments "" in each of their performances. I don't know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film. Sad for us but if that's true then the actors can take solace in that and feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time to such a flop. I disliked this movie for numerous reasons. I suspect that, or at least hope that ( for the actor's sakes anyway ) there are some real gems on the cutting room floor. As one reviewer has noted and I would agree, movie is almost impossible to market given it's finished form. Oh yeah and another thing...",0
"on what her step - father did to her. Movies that explain or explore the human condition aren't popular. It was a bit much to blame all of the Lohan's character's acting - out ( wrecking the car, drug use, etc. ) While not improbable, it's just a bit much to expect the audience to swallow.",0
"So it was when I watched Revolt of the Zombies. Recommended for only extremely patient. A great deal is asked from the imagination of the onlooker - maybe too much, in this case.",0
That's it. Revolt of the Zombies is BAD. It was Dean Jagger. Nothing was happening in the movie.,0
"Like equally dull King of the Zombies, this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own, but nothing more. Zero. and then the rather slow moving opening sequences. It started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score ( what - no brooding music? ) Even while realizing the era from which it was coming, I was sorely disappointed.",0
An expedition has been set up by General Duval to hunt for the secret since Tsiang ain't going to tell them much anymore. The acting is wooden & largely unimpressive. At only about an hour in length Revolt of Zombies still feels too long.,0
There's nothing new here!,0
How much longer? And definitely - a film about zombies ought to be about zombies. < br / > < br / > That's staggering ; what could the Halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here?,0
"If that film's zombies didn't thrill you, this one's certainly won't. < br / > < br / > Heads up!",0
"A love triangle complicates the story some. The Revolt of the Zombies is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is pretty far down on the list.

And he succeeds, at least at first. < br / > < br / > While I have seen a few movies that are worse, this is unlikely to please anyone.",0
"They certainly had much better table - manners in the old days.

"I'm working my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the movies in the set. What a yawn - fest, my daughter fell asleep half - way through. I am watching them with my soon - to - be seven - year old daughter, which makes most of these movies a laugh riot. < br / > < br / > I had a real hard time deciphering who these people worked for - - the allies or the axis ; but, I guess that doesn't really matter.",0
This one is insufferable. He stops. The movie just plods along.,0
"Why? The average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this rubbish as the average viewer today. Pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue : "" I'm going to make some tea / go outside / read my book now. "" I suspect this isn't true : it's not like IQ's have risen sharply in the last 7 decades. Which is far worse.",0
"What? This is 1936, you know.",0
"Louque agrees, but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves. Mabuse'films, including'Dr. It's unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact.",0
"A dismally dull dud. Sound exciting? Worse yet, Halperin crucially fails to bring any tension, atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings.",0
Why seven? Why not just one? < br / > < br / > Worst ending ever. Or nothing?,0
< br / > < br / > But we've got some dissent in those ranks. < br / > < br / > That's the question you'll be pondering if you take time to watch Revolt Of The Zombies. How was a society that created these ultimate warrior fighting machines ever defeated in the first place?,0
"This is the type of movie you should only see in case you already saw everything else. Still, this is far too little to give this film a positive rating, let alone a recommendation. Avoid!",0
"Well, first off, if you're checking out Revolt of the Zombies as some very early Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 ) - type film, forget it. It is quite a stretch to call this a horror film. < br / > < br / > The film is set during World War I.",0
? This movie was so bad that after it mercifully ended all I could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was. Was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies??,0
"Plus, once they leave the water, their costumes are 100 % dry!! The writing is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. !",0
"The acting isn't even good. It seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle. < br / > < br / > Wanna create a mind - controlled army of zombies? "" Be ready to crack a few eggs, including your own.",0
"Heck, if they can fix up "" The Hills Have Eyes "" then this film has hope. Halperin, the George A. Romero of his day, fails to deliver with this one, though. And the use of Lugosi's eyes? < br / > < br / > Where this film really excels is in the imagery.",0
The ending is interesting... so I'd say the movie is worth seeing at least once. The effect looks hopelessly fake these days but in 1936 I'm sure it had audiences gasping.,0
"That advice begins to transform Louque, particularly after he's successful in obtaining a stone tablet resembling a photo from the ancient city. In "" Revolt "", the zombies are enemy soldiers with a glazed over look that merely react to their mentor's commands. All it takes is placing his right fist to the forehead simulating a third eye, and casting his thoughts out to those he wishes to control.",0
"Open mouth as it to scream. Frankenstein must be destroyed - manana. "" Let's get him grrr. Do not show any emotion. < br / > < br / > The revolt of the zombies when it comes is so slow! Thus 35 minute's worth of story is padded out to 60ish minutes. Do not move.",0
This film is awful.,0
I don't care about these people or their meandering lives. And the best part? Now THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!,0
I remember watching it when it first came out. It's terrible.,0
"Then it rewards the winner money. If your not, this entire series is as I say, drivel dripping with gravy. This just doesn't employ professional actors.",0
"Far more interesting than the death of main villain in part two. Darkman 3 is worse than Darkman 2, and is nothing special, in my opinion.",0
Most of the cast look like they should be doing soft core porn..... Very strange either way.,0
"Why? This film feels like two or three episodes of a television show edited together more than an actual film. I can't really explain it, because the movie certainly doesn't.",0
"OK, but does that make this a good movie? oh well. there isn't a whole lot to recommend it. 5 / 5 this is just my opinion.",0
"I have all 3 on DVD, added these to my collection of DVD movie sets. By the way if your wondering how I came across this one on DVD. There isn't too many good horror, thriller, sets out there.",0
This is the worst movie I have ever seen.,0
"The film is pretty confusing and ludicrous. '. Sharon stone is a bit old for this too. The plot twists a few times, but the ending is awful. Don't ruin the run.",0
This is a poor film at best. The acting is nonexistent. It wasn't worth it. Don't be fooled.,0
< br / > < br / > But no. Most of the acting is sub - par.,0
Pointless.,0
"Danielle Brett is Lundgren's eventual love interest and his brother's widow. I think Dolph Lundgren had potential at being a big action star a la Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and even Van Damme to certain degree. Just the plot and premise immediately make it a B - Movie Porn at very best. To explain how classy and well To call it campy would be a huge understatement.",0
"First of all, the old saying'You can't judge a book by it's cover'applies here. To set it in the 70's makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever. Very bad. If you haven't seen the movie and don't mind spoilers read ahead. Jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover.",0
"If anything else though, it shows how underrated Lundgren is, as an actor. However the movie is lackluster, the action is non - existent, the plot not given enough exploration ( Too much boring B.",0
"It also calls out CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. I've tried to like this film, really.",0
"In my book "" Basic Instinct "" was a perfect film. It does damage to the original, so bad is it. There should be a law : Don't ever make a sequel to perfect film!",0
let's value it.,0
Look out for shaky Spielberg in - joke.,0
"I cant understand at all why so many Godzilla fans think this is excellent, one of the best Godzilla films ever in fact. This film is horrible and one of the very few Gojira films I cant stand to watch again ( the other being G. vs Megalon ).",0

"about the worst ideas you've ever heard. Well, so is SHOAH. You would think that by the 90s the Japanese would know better than to trust people in spaceships. What can you say about a culture willing to rape its own sacred cultural icons for a quick buck? I like it. Then they act on them.",0

"< br / > < br / > In this film, two families are followed : one white, one black. The 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people.",0
And do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time? No.,0
The problem is the role of the characters in the film.,0
But there lies also some of the problems of this picture. It tries to grab your heart ( even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious ) and succeeds most of time.,0
"The narrative doesn't move but proceeds at a snail's pace in an abrupt series of jerks. The credited thespians generally come off worse than the unknowns. Actually "" movie "" is the wrong word. For instance, at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear. Admittedly, most of the cast are saddled with atrocious King James dialogue which has to be heard to be believed!",0
I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just amazingly bad.,0
"Some films should Instinct "" is a compelling torture. The acting here is really bad. And now, God knows why, she's in the game again. """,0
"Boring. The acting is bad, as is the plot. Horrible film. About an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl.",0
"Tatum O'Neill was not in her element. The premise for Circle of Two is an intriguing one. The only scene I liked with her in was at very end when she said nothing at all. Who does that? Her performance seemed superficial, like a contestant at a beauty pageant. The rest of the cast was also dismal. That was probably the closest Tatum's Sarah Norton ever came to being real.",0
from other films and they all seem rather pointlessly annoying ie. The result just left the audience feeling rather inadequate.,0
Cause i can love old film as well as new. Or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me. The scenery looks like cheap Theatre. Then this is a movie for you!,0
"but how? you showed ONE death? So he starts off the story in Victorian times. Oh blocking, who needs you? and by killed off, i mean drug offscreen. there was no guy in that apartment! and here's how the scene goes ( Guy and girl are in a field. So eventually all the girls get killed off. He says it's because he saw it. ooh. < br / > < br / > OK, time for the story. None of the characters in this movie are likable. pretty music starts to play ) ( guy stares at girl ) ( girl stares at guy ) ( guy stares at girl ) cut back to movie.",0

"Their careers had no point in the plot, and this seems like a forced situation. How does this make you a demon? His background involves a man whose love is killed by another man.

The rewrite would focus on Floored by Love being a poor and ineffective send - up of old sitcoms. Cara's situation is contrasted with that of Jesse ( Trent Millar ). Will she? That same week British Columbia legalizes gay marriage. It's possible that the campiness was purposeful. If this is indeed the case than this review should probably be rewritten. < br / > < br / > Cara ( Shirley Ng ) and Janet ( Natalie Sky ) are a lesbian couple living in Vancouver.,0

"Great Work... This Is Pretty Funny. """,0
"It is then when we find out who did it and why. Maybe catch it on TV, but it'not worth buying.",0
I was VERY disappointed with this film. These women weren't liberated in a positive sense.,0
"Same string of letters two entirely different meanings. I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully. These writings look like one long word & the translators added all of the above. Anyone can skew data & prove anything they like but it doesn't make it true. Talk about ego! Putting soapbox away, God Bless Maegi Me thinks he ( the lady ) doth protest too much.",0
Atheists he interviewed for the film were notable authors and scholars. Which is correct ( Acts 2 ). He also throws around nonsense that Paul didn't believe Jesus was a real person. More deception? He then edits in a series of violent images from the Passion as if to hammer home his point.,0
I was curious to watch this movie. There is no passage in the bible where Jesus supports killing. He is love! Jesus told a story about an evil king. Please use your brain. I also have my beliefs.,0
There were way to many umms and pauses when he should have been talking in the movie. He's not even coy about it. animation was also pretty damn bad. < br / > < br / > The whole idea that Jesus is a mythical character is not taken seriously by historians and biblical scholars.,0
"The film is, as a whole, convoluted And what of the much - touted sexual shenanigans? His dough - faced mamma's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering, orange - skin machismo of Michael Douglas. Thrilling, sexy trash, but trash nonetheless. It was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist.",0
"It'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, but as a whole, the movie is disappointing.",0
"I personally found this movie to be terrible, first it was hardly objective, and provided one side of the debate. Oh and also the Techno Music just made the film harder to watch.",0

Harris also has some good ( and easily Google'd ) interviews on Salon.",0
This will be brief. I just couldn't take it seriously.,0
Don't be fooled by poor investigation. Why?,0
"< br / > < br / > This film has valid points, but they are very few and represented in a very biased context. However, anti - Christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue. I'm not recommending against seeing it. And this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to Christian teachings.",0
"With that said, this movie does a pretty poor job of proving that thesis. I'm sorry, but revealing that average Christians don't know much about their religion isn't exactly damning evidence of Christianity's fraudulence. Skip it.",0
The director of Basic Instinct 2 is no Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The audience was laughing many times. The new composer is no Jerry Goldsmith and its shows. And the suspense is very low. There's no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. It had this specific Paul Verhoeven's style. It's a pity that they made this film.,0
"< br / > < br / > first we can examine his misleading claim about Hebrews 8. He does what most so called Bible believing people he accuses of doing, the same.. That is TAKING things out of context.

"" Really no reason to examine this much further because of a few very glaring and bias misleading statements.",0
"I'm an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic and was thus expecting to enjoy this film. It's too bad that his Christian upbringing traumatized him, but he needn't subject an audience to his coping mechanism.",0
"He was asking good questions but, like the film itself, the interview crumbled into attack on this particular private school's rules, not Christianity. OK, aside from the psychedelic background imagery, the info presented here was good. Then he brings up the chronology of Christianity's origins and presents an'ok'case, but not one that blew me away. The music I could have done without ( not that it was bad music, just that it didn't fit this film at all ).",0
"Most importantly, it lacks integrity. This film, however, winds up flat and unsatisfying.",0
He is not the problem here.,0
"Japan had her imperial ambitions, but so did everyone else including the USA at that time. He advocated strict immigration policies for Orientals. Some of that experience in another day and time would have been condemned as racism. Jack London's life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him. London was part of the cause not a prophet crying in the wilderness. < br / > < br / > The film puts the cart before the horse.",0
Caught this movie on the tube on a Sunday. I was not surprised at the amount of silly people who enjoyed this fluff.,0
"Voiceless shadows in the background, of no consequence.",0
It was an odd and bizarre movie.,0
"OMG. And the editing! I mean!..... this film. I just rented ( yes! She is not charming ; she is not pretty. Cut! """,0
Avoid this bloated whitewash of musical. Not exactly faithful to the novel. The poor of London coming out to sing?,0
Awful story terrible performance.,0
I think I missed seeing half of the movie. Their relationships did not seem believable.,0
I watched the DVD ( called BLACK WIDOW in the U. S. A. ) It's really like silly putty!,0
"So how to classify it? I'm quite perplex about everything. They are kind of a bump in the already sluggish flow. < While Seymour Cassel, pokes his head in now and then. Like it believes it does. He looks dog tired! The title, the story and the motivation. Most of the action stays at the one location the house.",0
"The only thing I'd add is "" passionless. "" This movie is a "" deconstructed thriller "". At the restaurant, Dafoe passes on the "" deconstructed jambalaya "".",0
This movie was the worst i've ever seen. !,0
Why a dead caretaker? Why? that aspect was never pursued...... as for William Defoe... What is the point of the night vision? I understand the previous reviewer comments that this is a miss - understood movie. I understand wanting to make a movie that is edgy and different.,0
A bit of a heartbeat would have been nice. Morgue attendant? Only one thing could have redeemed this sketch.,0
Argh. Generally it ruins story. It did with this one.,0
"And the sex scenes are downright lame. ). Then, it's busy repulsing you. < br / > < br / > The acting ( except for Dafoe ) is horrible. < br / > < br / > Just awful.",0

"I felt like it was 90mins wasted as I waited anxiously for a plot to develop, or even begin. It certainly didn't have taste. That is if you can call it erotic.",0
"How bad was it? Within a day, she starts a relationship with Leslie, ( Dafoe ) the caretaker of house.",0

This is on a par with a Harlequin Romance. Why was he still driving a car?,0
All in all the complete litany of the radical religious right wing. We purchased this series on DVD because of all of the glowing reviews we had seen here. Just be sure to purchase an inexpensive used copy so you can avoid enriching ultra right wingers at Faux Network who produced this travesty.,0
"We ask that this series be trashed as it already is and its really starting to smell! ! Captain Kirk "" is "". It was funny, diversified, and to some extent factual.",0
I tolerated the first season. Denny Crane is just annoying. I don't think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions.,0
"Shani Wallis was far too old to play Nancy, who was only supposed to be 16.",0
William Shatner in small doses is tolerable. I don't travel the same routes.,0
In my life I have seen many great and awful movies. It seems that your 14 year old son could act better. You sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear them.,0
"I really thought Mac was really good. If anyone can explain it to me I'd love to informed. Maybe I just don't "" get "" this film.",0
This movie is not. It had all of the same features. But Napolean Dynamite was actually funny. Its script worked. A very very very dry humor / comedy.,0
On balance not a lot to be said for this. By this time he'd made around a half dozen films and had still to find a style. This is perfectly true but how did Mitchum KNOW? I looked in vain for any'signature'scenes given that it was Robert Wise on bullhorn.,0
Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is an awful movie. This movie look like an amateur one.,0
"Loretta Young was charming, though astonishingly young. ( Let's hear Luigi and his blond girlfriend's argument, please! ) Some of the intertitles are overly explanatory ( e. g., "" why, you're not a child anymore!

"Tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. Tito competes for Simonetta's affections with a young and handsome'Count'Luigi ( Nils Asther ). Although he is not her biological father, he has raised her like a daughter. That kind of "" ick "" factor permeates throughout the film. The film is noteworthy only because of Loretta Young, who would go on to have a great career.",0
They failed and rather spoilt everything.,0
"The same difficulty I have with the musical version of "" Les Miserables "" applies equally to "" Oliver. "" < br / > < br / > The gloom, despair and depravity of much of novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography. All this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me. This may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret.",0
It needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the hospital. Please change it. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. Get Tritter out.,0
"The premise, while not quite ludicrous, WAS definitely ridiculous. House hires some guy and de - physicalizes Tritter.",0
"When I read MOST of the other comments, I felt they were way too glowing for this movie. < br / > < br / > This was a very sorry return for Zatoichi. See one of the earlier versions or the 2003 ALL - NEW version.",0
"Not the same experience at all. Had I never seen them, I would have thought this good - looking but empty ; since I had, I thought its style inappropriate and its content insufficient.",0
This movie is just the opposite. Everything was overdone to the point of absurdity. The raspy voice - overs seemed amateurish to me.,0
Worth a look but ultimately disappointing.,0
"Death and the Compass falls into the latter category, and while I respect its ( mostly ) original approach to tackling a detective - killer story, it too falls on its face and its weirdness becomes oddly dull. I respect Alex Cox the filmmaker, I really do.",0
"or "" For goodness sake, get ON with it! "" Nope, though I at least recognized who characters were who would turn out to be important later. I'm frankly suspicious when I see that a film's director also wrote it. Not recommended.",0
First off - there's absolutely no flirting going on in this film - with Anthony or anyone else. They all deserve better. So you make it through the torture and mayhem. These people don't flirt - they just do it.,0

I try to find some reason to explain a horror writers art but this stuff... pure crap. < br / > < br / > I dunno why I try not to totally hate his works. If at least the cruelty and drawn out deaths had a purpose to the story to justify their inclusion but the script was just unintelligible and just plain stupid.,0
And let's not forget camera work that was pretty nauseating at times. Seed just isn't one of those. Maybe he should stick to comedy?!,0
It's crap. The actors are awful as well. F * ck this movie. This movie is unbelievably ridiculous.,0
I'm tired of it.,0
A complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates. a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest... if you are the sort of person who likes that... see a shrink.,0

And I'm a fan of the guyhis films exhibit a uniquely screwball vision, and are never dull. I think not. But then came "" Seed, "" and the counter was reset to Zero, keeping his bid for legitimacy and respect that much further out of reach.",0
My nine year old niece could make a better film. Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. OH! Christmas is coming.,0
"Seed comes out of his grave, kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on. Cops bust Seed in his house, act stupid and get slashed in the dark. Guess what... they just bury him alive to solve the problem. < br / > < br / > 3.",0
The difference being that Mostel's character knew he was making bowel fill. Boll's attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined. Indeed he's probably the only filmmaker that's boostedsaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbage. Maybe Uwe knows it too.,0

"I know my schlock. When the actors begin to be acceptable, the direction falls to pieces. This movie was horrible, simply put. And I know this movie sucks.",0
This film was the recipient of the 1990 Academy award for Best Animated Short Film. I assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre. Could Pixar have not entered it? NOTHING.,0
Please if you have seen this film write here and put an end to shlock. About the worst movie in distribution right now!,0
I love Zombie - Movies and I love amateur - productions.,0
"I have to say I hated this movie. About a half an hour of boring conversation, sorry to all who actually care about the plot, I started fast - forwarding to Gerry's scenes.",0
"In all, dreadful.",0
This movie was messed up.,0
"this movie should be seen nevermore! apparently, people give a what their ancestors did. eff off. at the end, ann shoots ethan while he's trying to kill her best friend.",0

I watched mask in the 80's and it's currently showing on Fox Kids in the UK ( very late at night ). I never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was. It's just plain awful!,0
"I am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on directing, this could have been a half decent film.",0
It was done in 1986. Mike Nichols directing. It's not that it's such a bad picture. It felt like six. ) Slow and unfocused! Uh uh.,0
The movie was watchable while Nicolson was on the screen.,0
Most of the characters in this film lack anything to hold on to. The story is very simple.,0
I laughed maybe three times and that is not enough for a comedy.,0
This movie isn't very good. No wonder this went straight to cable.,0
"I enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder, and part one 5 times as much. But that wasnt worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a matinee of this with my fiance. The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the Aliens Say Goodbye.",0
Hollywood does it again.,0
Anna Faris gives a funny performance and she's also kind of underrated. Why he keeps getting cast is unclear because he isn't funny. The rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos. The second one wasn't as good but still quite funny.,0
"I knew it, the audience knew it and the CAST knew it.",0
But what the hell happened? ! Scary Movie 3 is such a stinkfest its hard to put it in words.,0
This movie is bad. I have watched them in comedies since 1998. Whatever happened to real humor? They're so dated. Ring parodies are not funny. You want proof?,0
Mplayer managed to run it flawlessly. I'd ruin my reputation. And then the two main characters moved.... and spoke... And the movie died for me. Everything looked real.,0
"There's no truth, no struggle and a bad surprise ending. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo are trying to run away from who knows what. He betrays us. They're breathtaking. As said before, the visual effects are stunning. But that's all this movie is. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here.",0
I have seen short films with twice the emotion in half time!,0
"< br / > < br / > As a whole, the movie doesn't really go anywhere. A huge problem with them, however, is the vast overruse of light bloom. < br / > < br / > One thing to note is the terrible voice acting. The plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point.",0
This thing here just wears same name.,0
"The pair actually "" duck "" each other's non - existent bullets. If I were to create a movie thermometer, this movie would be absolute zero.",0
"No, this is just a 10 car pile - up caught on video. < br / > < br / > The writing : pathetic. < br / > < br / > The acting : pathetic. That doesn't explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fist - fight scenes, however. < br / > < br / > The cinematography : too inept for words. < br / > < br / > The directing : pathetic.",0
"I'm not sure this is one of those. Worked for Roger Corman. I mean, I'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker. They recorded the sound on different bloody channels! But watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it. It really does. But alas, no. At first I thought I'd hooked it up wrong.",0
"Another FINE effort by America's most UNDERrated filmmaker. 100 % UNTRUE. I thought the movie said "" get ON the bus ""...? The views presented by that man are simply WRONG - all across the board.",0
Better luck next time Spike. There was one only white person on the bus. He is capable of much more than this movie.,0
It's not even worth the time it takes to watch for free. The acting is passable. Save your time. It's well crap.,0
"These are some of the Heroes of Horror. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, will try again.",0
The acting is alright for what it is. It's supposed to be a comedy....,0
this one was empty.,0
"It just falls short over and over again. "" Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often... they are reason this gets 4 stars from me. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to it's potential.",0
"Her frailty is oversold... she's irritating in extreme. But this is just misconceived horror sap. It did not sustain my interest. Roman Polanski has made many, many movies that are unexceptional. His fame bewilders me.",0
"It gets real ugly from here. Otherwise, it's a bloody, confusing mess ( why is their tomb so far away from their castle? Other than that, it really wasn't worth my time. ), watchable only for the scant few minutes of vampyre playtime. Oops, so much for that secret existence. Ah, the sex - and - gore movie.",0
"We have the two girls. Why? There are, as I said, some effective scenes by the director... The house is also a most impressive set. Sure, it has a pair of lovely girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires. There really isn't much of a story here. The end gets going with some juicier scenes, but it is anti - climatic.",0
"Daubeney') uses these commercial elements as mere backdrop to a languid meditation on life, death and the impulses - sexual and otherwise - which affirm the human condition. It isn't difficult to see why! VAMPYRES < br / > < br / > Aspect ratio : 1.",0
This is far from only case. Peter Falk spews out the Lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie!,0
"But whatever was good about Robotech was not the result of Macek's work or the "" voice talents "" he recruited. The originals are so much better, naturally, and make a lot more sense. Japanese creators. It was because of toils and efforts of the ( uncredited - why? would I be too bold to accuse HG of plagiarism here? )",0
"It was a Native American version of Mr. Magoo. Words cannot express how bad this film is. Save your bucks, it's not worth rental.",0
This movie is ridiculous. Lame.,0
I would rather get a root canal than view this film again. My only hope is that the Native actors in this film had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts.,0
Another made for TV piece of junk!,0
! 7 here at IMDb. It really was that bad.,0
"And the whole idea, hijacking a train? What a waste. !",0
See it if you can stomach it - I still have flashbacks.,0
What happens behind closed doors is never known or so we should believe. Jang had a great story Our characters are continually moving from hotel room to hotel room to best quench their thirst for each other's flesh. This leads me to the biggest issue that I had with this film.,0
"I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? This is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black & white. This movie is a rather odd mix of musical, romance, drama and crime with a sniff of film - noir to it. He simply isn't convincing in his role. It just isn't an interesting or compelling movie to watch. He's an extremely small boyish looking man.",0
"I don't recommend this one! If they'd casted the right person for dubbing the dialog, this film MIGHT have been decent. Yes, it is THAT bad!",0
"She should have bitten him. It could have been a fun and bloody little romp, but director has left with more of a comedy, for all the wrong reasons. < br / > < br / > As it stands, the cast have no chemistry whatsoever. But not a lot. Even as trashy movies go it's not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining. Mind you, they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too.",0
"What does the "" Executive producer "" do in a movie. Likely?",0
"They are not excellent but rather good for the Russian film. The only positive moment I found in the "" Power of Fear "" is the visual effects. That's why I give it two stars. And the music is OK, at least it doesn't irritate me.",0
"You won't miss much by missing out on this film. He travels to this small town where it's said that a witch ( Ita Ever ) is terrorizing the community. Ivan ( Valeri Nikolayev ) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained.",0
"Part of it is the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods America but clearly isn't. As I've said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball curio. < br / > < br / > The film isn't very good. Nikolai Gogol's story "" Viy "" has been filmed again and released to home video in the US via Faith Films.",0
"It is based on Nikolai Gogol's story "" Viy "" which is a classic in Russia. "" Instead, the less you know about Gogol, the better. In a strange nod to Russianness, journalist is named Ivan Berkhoff. POSSIBLY VERY MINOR SPOILERS < br / > < br / > This movie is billed as the first Russian horror movie.",0
"He's not a great actor but maybe a nice star with some good movies which this is not one of them. It's the presence of ( Alec Baldwin ). So not to mention ( literally! ) As I don't see them both as not sexy only, but UGLY too! ). And if you hate that so shoot me down but you know what?! I've just watched this movie so I'm dead already!. It's surely insanity or bad tasting? What's in here?!",0
"As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw enough said. Did makeup people have it in for Michael, what were they thinking.",0
Nowhere near the original. < br > < br / > This is a complete waste of your time. But the directing is very poor.,0
"* * from * * * * As for the action scenes, they're pretty old hat, which causes one to wonder : why even remake original? Basinger does well and certainly looks good, but James Woods is artificially hammy in a silly mob - magnet role.",0
But the remake has no action!,0
So obviously in this adventure he isn't alone.,0
"Didn't enjoy this one to much. And what action there is to!! It stars Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as the Mc Coy's. It really could have been better I think. Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much much more. I don't think Bassenger's eye makeup moves once during the whole picture.",0
"One viewing was more than enough, not just because it didn't have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made. < br / > < br / > The movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words. By contrast Baldwin, Bassinger & company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, with only Michael Madsen's and James Woods'slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real people. Like someone else points out, Peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action / adventure heist genre.",0
< br / > < br / > The film sounds much better than it turned out.,0
Too bad that Tieney's career never really gelled. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner.,0
It was simply that bad.,0
Mariesa Tomei probably wishes this role had never come her way. < br / > < br / > Jane The kids are all a mess.,0
This is a story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. < br / > < br / > Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno come in towards the end. I guess film is promoting independence and some good old self - esteem. The parents have divorced and mom remains back east in the house. They play Murray's brother and sister - in - law respectively ; they're also the parents of Tomei.,0
The female vampire simply isn't scary or sexy. However story has less cool bits this time. This film has no tension like that. A real let down for me personally. There is no army of masters.,0
This film is probably the worst film that I have ever seen. Perhaps 4.,0
"The entire look of the film is just ugly. Their characters are by nature crazy, but Pryce and Rea overact parts to death. But the stockpile of these bodies is a small one, and Rock needs more - and he prefers them fresher. Being a maverick within his circle, he begins to pay people to find bodies for him to study and test on.",0
"How surprising. < br / > < br / > And yes, the music score mostly resembled whale sounds. < br / > < br / > 2 / 10. That's an unusual form for a movie, but it still can be viewed as art even when concept is as simple and naive as here.",0
That being said : DON T SEE IT! I almost fell asleep.,0
"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! God!... Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, stay home.",0
< br / > < br / > Did not enjoy it at all.,0
"That said, there are some stunning images, but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination, so that's no reason to go and see this nonsense.",0
"Typical empty post - modern "" conceptual "" art. Those "" pearl "" divers... Everything could construct a great surreal movie with some content. ! He can produce eye - candy ( and I like candy ), but its pretentiousness and fundamental artistic emptiness just diminishes all the joy. I just don't buy it, sorry. And so boring. Ships "" meeting "" on sea... Ideas of feces as an object of value ( if it was feces ).",0
"I watched this movie as a preview of a Matthew Barney art exhibit. It certainly prepared me. The film "" peaks "" with enough gratuitous shock - art to turn your stomach. < br / > < br / > What was the point of the movie?",0
< br / > < br / > As for the movie... eh. Nothing special.,0
"Maybe when mammoth turds and spinal columns are used in a whale blubber experiment. Which is about the art itself. < br / > < br / > How do you know when you're in the middle of a pretentious art film? At 135 minutes, it adds to its pretension by being boring to boot.",0
I have seen Jodorowsky's HOLY MOUNTAIN. And BTW I am filmmaker. < br / > < br / > The Emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney you have been outted!,0
"If this sounds like your cup of tea, then you will absolutely LOVE it! You get from it what you take from it. The soundtrack is at times beautiful and annoying... sometimes even maddening. A very long and ponderous two hours and fifteen minutes. This is the very definition of an art film.",0
boring and pointless. 3lbs is obviously just a self indulgent programme for Stanley Tucci to be a producer / moody deep doctor. In the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the leads's social life as a father - snooze!,0
"< br / > < br / > I didn't know show was canceled until I read the comments on IMDb, but it doesn't come as a surprise to me. Indira Varma's character Adrienne Holland is too similar to Jennifer Morrison's doctor Cameron to be a co - incidence.",0
"Take for example a scene where the hero is confronting a loopy militia leader called Dawson. As a satire it's very silly, so silly that it becomes almost unwatchable. This might have been justified if there was entertainment value to the movie but there's none.",0
A disappointment on all counts.,0
things seem to happen for no reason. it doesn't really work as either. i can't say i liked this movie very much. and it's also extremely convoluted.,0
"So I stuck with it to the end, hoping that the whole tangled mess would untangle itself. The cast is packed with extraordinary talent but most of them are wasted. Even when I got that the joke was on me, I still felt Winter Kills to be a pretty awful movie. Nick follows the clues, but every step of the way the people helping him seem to die in mysterious circumstances.",0
"Camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively. I mean, don't we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas? I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband!",0
gore was decent. Warn people about Rodentz. !,0
"Just horrendous. seriously, are And that giant rat suit - - OH MY GOD!!!!!!!! Spoiler below, but read on or you'll never know the horrible fate that awaits all planing to rent "" Rodentz "". < br / > < br / > On a moonlit night, in a remote research laboratory, a major medical breakthrough is about to have deadly results. Everything about it screams "" Low - budget! ), to music and special effects that could be done on a children'workshop PC.",0
One out of ten. What a terrible film.,0
"For a start the character's are dumb, annoying & clichéd. For a start the Altered Species moves along at a fair pace which is just about the best thing I can say about it & thankfully doesn't last that long. Walter's friends turn up but he can't leave while the rat is still missing so everyone helps him look for it.",0
"This is not for you. For once, the film was everything we'd expected. And more!",0
"The other comments give the idea well enough. Why we didn't get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me. < br / > < br / > But not for more than 99¢, OK? Really, you need to rent it and see for yourself.",0
"I can assure you, it wont. just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one.",0
"This is where the film takes a weird twist. But they never do, even though we are to believe this wilderness chase goes on throughout night. The hero needs to get to her quickly, so he decides to drive there in his car. Now mind you, this isn't a modern - day ATV, it's a 1920 Maxwell automobile, so it looks very out - of - place as an off - road vehicle.",0
I was pretty disappointed. But it got old very fast.,0
"This film, like the first one I love those high country shots in Australia. Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good.",0
"'Something New,'despite its claim, is hackneyed. At least, Shipman gives impression that she doesn't take herself or the film seriously - - and neither do I. This time, she does better, although it seems pointless.",0
"At very best, three out of 10.",0
"Me want You! "" Hope Lange's scientist / love - interest is given the short shrift, but not before she screams at indifferent - lover Dillman : "" What do I have to do, talk Ape Man? Abhorrent concoction very loosely based on Walter Ericson's book "" Fallen Angel "" ( filmed in 1965 as "" Mirage "" with Gregory Peck ). This is one frantic "" Jigsaw ""!",0
"But the production literally doesn't have the guts to pull it off. THE IMMORTALIZER was, uh, interesting. He has a nice evil laugh.",0
"But you only get that for 20 seconds. No sex, no gore, no tease. What the hell is she doing in a picture like this?",0
"< br / > < br / > Actors are not bad, not good either. Maybe it's a delayed film? In conclusion, nothing great at all.",0
"Whatever the storyline, it was just a wrestling event. Jericho was the one that jeopardised the whole match. No, not in the slightest. There was only ONE survivor series match.",0
"It was obvious, with that statement, that the WWF would prevail. Overall : very innovative storyline but poor execution, which is not the scarcity of the wrestlers because the match format is tag - team.",0
They act like puppets.,0
Without the charm of The Black Stallion. A mess of a movie.,0
"Cabbages, mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates. < br / > < br / > I can onlypeculate about the sort of audience who might actually like Rabbit Test. Trying to put together an Airplane! It's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film.",0
Not even the gang at MST3K could've made this worth watching! I took a date to see it.,0

< br / > < br / > Avoid this at all costs.,0
"It remains the worst movie I've ever seen. < br / > < br / > Before seeing this, I never much minded Rivers, one way or the other. If I can save just one person from watching this, then my existence on this earth will have been justified. It never did.",0
"It just wasn't the same without Spur and Harrison, as portrayed by Douglas. I'll stick with the first one, and try to forget I ever saw sequel! Quite an insult to viewer intelligence, according to members of my family.",0
"I didn't like this film at all! I was pleasantly amazed! To my mind, that would be much better to give this role to a Russian actress, because that would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person.",0
Looks like a CGI explosion.,0
Why? At one point I think thats its Busey.,0
"actually i hesitate to use the word movie. but i will say one thing. i got it really cheap, and i still got ripped of. i don't know what they were thinking.",0
Pathetic action scene and really bad acting also don't help.,0
"Mack & Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Fl.",0
He was just too old for this role. All that and his bald spot just annoyed me.,0
"If anyone knows of one please tell me. I think for the time ( 60's ) this was a very well done version of Hamlet but cannot compare to Branagh's complete version. < br / > < br / > just a note... As the front cover says "" The hamlet of our time, for our time "".",0
Brian Cox acted really well.,0
"See this film if you must, but : bring your vomit bag, and don't have pasta salad beforehand. Unfortunately, I'm not making any of this up.",0
i am surprised that no one walked out earlier than that.,0
Boring! No acting talent shown - just reading a part.,0
"Not sure why this film was advertised as a wild, quirky, laugh filled comedy.",0
"No way, I say! It is sick humor at best. This movie was the man's version of "" Mommy Dearest. "" So many scenes reminded me too graphically of my own life experiences. < br / > < br / > Someone told me it was funny.",0

"I haven't read the book and don't think I will after this ). < br / > < br / > How this fine cast got mixed up in this I don't know - I can't believe they saw the screenplay before signing. In contrast, somehow, Alec Baldwin rises above the material to deliver to make up a movie - going audience - I'm certainly stunned by the number of positive comments this wretched film has garnered here.",0
I would have left the movie halfway through if I hadn't been with people who liked it. Those few moments were more entertaining than previous 2 hours. What a waste of an outstanding cast!,0
"That leaves nobody to adequately play Jane Russell. < br / > < br / > This is an interesting, at times embarrassing, waste of resources.",0
"Looking at it now, it seems charming. I saw this recently on a faded old VHS tape, and remembered it dimly.",0
Movie after movie were praised by critics and played loads of money. Is it the awkward clerk played by Harald Eia? Imagine.. Actual comedies were made! The movie is just not funny! Not ever. < br / > < br / > But thats not my main rant about United. Is it the commentaries by Arne Scheie? Show me the humor!,0

I'm sure movie - going public was paying their tickets to see Cagney dance. I think you can figure where this is going. So why did he make so few of them? < br / > < br / > No wonder Cagney went running back to Warner Brothers.

He has it in him. The opening 5 minutes gave me hope. Painful viewing.,0
Such a shame.,0
"It was weak, very very weak.",0
What was the point of that? The rest are either tasteless or rehashed from IMOM. It was a lone star that few people had heard of. < br / > < br / > The new characters are very unwelcome. In total there's about two or three good jokes. The film is simply overrun with cameos. International Man of Mystery came straight out of the blue.,0

Forget this one, and go buy Leonard's most recent album if you want to pay tribute to him. It is so bloody PRECIOUS with its endless close - ups of over emoting singers.",0
"Gee, what a concept! Leonard doesn't need Bono or the Edge talking about his spirituality. < br / > < br / > Cohen fans, don't say I didn't warn you!",0
"just throw it in the garbage and at least save your time. This film should have been only 10 minutes. Well, Nick Cave does a reasonable job covering one of Cohen's famous songs. There is not a single footage of Cohen's past.",0
"Only rarely does the film feature Cohen reading his own work ( never singing ) - - like letters, poems, etc. More often, the covers are badly sung folk versions. ! A huge disappointment for a big Cohen fan.",0
< br / > < br / > So sad This film is a disservice to him.,0
"Part of the score hardly recalls any associations I may have expected. Perhaps a reference to his once use of LSD. < br / > < br / > The entire montage and screenplay is much like a high school extramural project. He does however feature as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. I would not consider myself as one of Leonard Cohen's greatest fans. Some of the camera - work is dismal. Warming and humble. A lot is said in this respect, but the viewer is not drawn into the person Leonard Cohen. The collaboration with U2 is a farce. At times it seemed the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film.",0
"Too bad it didn't stay in the family. If there is a form of art that doesn't need embellishments, it's Cohen's art. It's the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as Lennon's "" Imagine. "" < br / > < br / > A sad show, really, and sadder if you truly love Cohen as I do.",0
This film was a disaster from start to finish. ). The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as St. Leonard or as some Old Testament prophet.,0

!,0
Just watching the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate. I will say movie was OK besides the major Fla!!!!! !,0
This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I rest my case. All this this from the UK funding agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men... it's not. They should hang their heads in shame. ! There is no hope for the British film industry whilst idiots are running the show.,0
"< br / > < br / > OK I know that many of you will think that I'm crazy, but this is just my point When will people wake up and see that u will never ever find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie... Its all covered up and buried deep down.",0
It's nowhere close to a good movie. I am unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie. I am unfortunate to say that that happened.,0
The complete and utter lack of respect for teacher. Who was this classless fat slob who portrayed Biggie? What man? The African American community should take umbrage at their very being.,0
"And was Lil'Kim's transformation from prim office drone into sex - obsessed, vampish diva really as banal as it appears here? Did he alone nurture his subsequent affiliation with Suge Knight? < br / > < br / > The storytelling, in both structure and content, is simplistic and trite. This film reminded me of The Sopranos, and not in a good way.",0
"Even in itself, the fighting is rather poor. < br / > < br / > What a tedious film. And not even particularly well. Better no plot and pure action than a clíche - ridden fleabag mongrel of a narrative. Blah blah blah.",0
Obviously fiction.,0
But has a few good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good. I really hope he can land a better movie in future so we can really enjoy his art..,0
< br / > < br / > The cast is misleadingly good. This is one of the most hateful and cruel movies I've seen in a long time. [ That's the last time that'll happen. ] There were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the film.,0
I might have enjoyed it more if I hadn't known that. Maybe. And there were a couple of quick nude scenes by callipygian Lenore Zann.,0

I remember watching it when it first came out. It's terrible.,0
"Then it rewards the winner money. If your not, this entire series is as I say, drivel dripping with gravy. This just doesn't employ professional actors.",0
Its a beautifully acted pairing and really is one of the screens great couples. Its a huge let down after the classic Tarzan and His Mate which is possibly the best film in the series. The middle third shows signs of having to stretch things out and having plot lines that ultimately went nowhere.,0
Why didn't people who made this movie? Can Jim stop him?,0
"Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? Both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry. How cool is that? There are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that's about it. The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain actually come from. Insignificant and low - brained ( haha! )",0
"At first Jim is able to resist the brain's mind control. While there Dr. Blake hooks Jim up to, well something I'm not actually sure what. This whatever it is, is attached to the brain.",0
A spoiler. Cheap Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever. The horror is hilarious.,0
"I mean, they are being chased by some weird looking'thing'in the sewers ( who is this thing? No, I don't. ), that's quite scary I guess, but do I really care? < br / > < br / > It's nothing new. It jumps right into the action. I wish they wouldn't do that, it's done so many times, it's boring and gets predictable. Creep - "" Your journey terminates here. """,0
"The scenes inside the PRI complex are especially bad. The Brain itself is gloriously goofy - looking, but it mostly just sits on its little platform.",0
The acting can go through with it.,0
"Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films. The plot is slow, painfully boring and the film constantly feels pointless.",0
"His head is chopped off and buried separately of his body... sounds like "" The Thing that wouldn't die "" doesn't it? I mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and I kept thinking "" When is it going to end ""?",0
"Which is a shame. This one's played by another Spanish horror great, the beautiful Helga Line. Most of the film's sex angle is laughably gratuitous. There are several rubbish moments like this, thanks largely to poor editing. Like all good magicians, Abanazer here has a lovely assistant. They're quickly scared off by a fire though, and don't bother coming back.",0

"I'm just surprised he didn't blow up anything. Shoot, that bar set must have cost a bundle. Just think, it cost a total of $ 250, 000 to make "" Clerks "". How the hell did they spend $ 45 Million to make this glorified music video?",0
"THAT was true Bruckheimer stuff. It's not worth either the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. A typical "" Chick - Feel - Good - Flick "", one could say. The plot itself is as shallow as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American Dream.",0
"If you are looking for classic horror, go and dig up a copy of Death Line ( aka Raw Meat ). < br / > < br / > Indeed strong points are sadly lacking.",0
"< br / > < br / > The film's only assets are the amazingly beautiful female leads. That audience might get a lot out of it from a titillation aspect, but adult audiences will feel annoyed and cheated.",0
What a disappointment!,0
The industry ispoiling the art in movies. Too obvious.,0
But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer? < br / > < br / > For starters I'd like to question the politics of the film. I find this most strange. These women are nothing more the whores. She'auctions'her father just as she'auctions'her boyfriend.,0
"Heck, I personally thought Bon Jovi was going to jump out with long hair and jam too! Whether you watched or made it, it looked like nothing but time killing. < br / > < br / > And finally, the music. Or wasting depending on how you look at it. Jersey girl goes to New York to become a song writer. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given.",0
"Wow. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent "" PokeMon ; First Movie "". Am I the only one disturbed by that? The girl was just a whiny brat who wanted things her own way. ( Or if you do see it, don't expect much. )",0
The only reason is to be a part of your child's world.,0
"< br / > < br / > Unfortunately, Creep fails in this area. No character is fully realized, although the circular nature of Kate's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story.

"The breakout part was Lady Penelope and Parker. Like Lost in Space, this could have been both visually stunning and exciting. I was one of those "" few Americans "" that grew up with all of Gerry Andersen's marvelous creations. They stole the show! I would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets. I didn't care too much for the characters in the original, but I was grateful for them in the movie.",0

These provided some light relief for those expecting a rerun of the TV series. This film is just a kids against evil genre.,0
"Or, 2 ; you're seeing it with someone under ten years old. To say that watching the'adventures'they get up to is painful is an understatement. Sophia Myles From the off, Thunderbirds is wrong, wrong, wrong.",0
The plot was very predictable. Sorry!,0
The heart that made Thunderbirds unique was GONE. There was little physical violence.,0
wow i payed £3. 50 to go see this movie at the cinema. Madonna should of won and Oscar compared to these guys.,0
"and so takes the tube. Memorise his face ; it'll help later. Just your average party but there's some guy there. He's pretty into Kate... if you know what I'm saying. Alone. Typically, she misses the train and finds herself locked in the London Underground. Or as the case may have it, Creep. EVER. So the timetable says the next, and last, train will come in 7 minutes.",0
"If you can accept the film on its very slim merits, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. The current team has done a fine job of translating his work to the big screen. < br / > < br / > BUT... < br / > < br / > This is one lame story. But not very. Watch original show, and you'll see what I mean. Product placement is way over the top here, and it's annoying.",0
Maybe even before. This movie doesn't. I practically died.,0
I grew up ( b. All my mates at school watched. Utter rubbish. 1965 ) watching and loving the Thunderbirds.,0
OK.. this movie could have been soooo good! It tried to pay homage whilst satirising it just generally fell flat on its face.,0
This is a truly awful film.,0
"Critics panned it, but I still wanted to go. Once it gets put on to filmwhat a mess we have on our hands. I just couldn't wait. When I heard that they were going to make a Thunderbirds movie, I was ecstatic. Then came August 2004, when the movie was finally released. After all, as long as the heart was in the same place, that was all that mattered to me. Thunderbirds are GO!",0
"The plot itself was so bland with clunky, awkward dialogue and weak jokes that probably wouldn't amuse brighter pre - teens.",0
"This formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 1964 - 68. < br / > < br / > Yes. The plot IS as limp as that! With the right material, they could have been show stoppers.",0
"< br / > < br / > The bad points : where to start? Ben Kingsley's career lowpoint performance? The terrible script, the lifeless direction, the odious moralising? One of them is that the film is mostly in focus. Grounded on a beautiful tropical island ( some punishment!",0
Just boring and well not worth the money. Okay I must say that before the revealing of the'monster '.,0
But CHACE IS THEEST! ! But still hot.,0
"Johnathan Frakes is a good actor and, when he's not directing a family film, a fine director. One other reviewer here indicated that Penelope wouldn't be caught dead in a Ford. If you've seen the original Supermarionation series, then you'll know what I'm talking about! And, there were characters who did get killed, although most were bad guys. The Ford, Ford, FORD! < br / > < br / > This motion picture is almost pure blasphemy.",0
maybe. I remember it very clearly. That is all I remember. He even had the red jacket.,0
"No gore, no suspense, no violence, nothing. The only scary thing about this piece of scum is that majority of the IMDb users gave it a 10. This is really horrifying. This one isn't scary, isn't gory, isn't even funny as a comedy, so don't waste your precious time.",0

Remain on earth, and you will face illness and eventually your demise. < br / > < br / > Gwen Verndon showed that she could still dance. < br / > < br / > I only hope that this film doesn't encourage seniors to commit mass suicide on the level of Jim Jones. Too bad the movie didn't concentrate more on that. Why did Steve Guttenberg jump ship as well? < br / > < br / > Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense? < br / > < br / > This is quite a depressing film when you think about it.",0
"So I imagined somebody like Pierce Brosnan in the role. However, I didn't have very high expectations for the movie. Stick to the book, folks, it's much better. Undeniably good writing and interesting story. So that lost a few stars for me right there.",0
< br / > < br / > 4 / 10 Surprisingly enough does movie does have some redeeming quality in it when it moves toward its end. I just couldn't cared less really at times. < br / > < br / > But what's hurting this movie more is its writing. In that regard these movies always seem like a wasted opportunity.,0
"I dare say the movie is a piece of trash that doesn't do the series even a sniff of justice. Please, even if you didn't like the movies, give the book series a chance.",0
Not recommended for anyone with a 3 - digit IQ.,0
The movie kept going on. Gotta love her.,0
"This reminds me of James Bond movies, only that those have more action! would not either. Since I cannot count myself a Christian I find whole idea ludicrous.",0
"I didn't expect much from this film, but oh brother, what a stinker. As cheap as this disc was, I feel ripped off. No preaching.",0
"This is not the film to rally Christians around it. For a similar reason, I watched this film adaptation. The characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped. The dialogue sometimes sounds rushed. The music is schizophrenic. I can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane, but that's it. At least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory. The film also suffers from book's preachiness although its message isn't quite as in your face. Events feel scattered and disconnected.",0
"If you hadn't read the book, you'd have no idea what was going on. I'm upset that I actually paid money for this movie. The ending was awful. Second, it made no sense. First of all, it didn't even go all the way through the first book.",0
"The effects are wholly unoriginal and flat. Left Behind is an incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars. The acting is weak and uninspiring, the story even weaker.",0
"< br / > < br / > But THAT, of course, won't be enough. Never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent. Let's see : FIRST, they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread. It is, after all, good old fashioned Capitalism at work. What an interesting day that would be! Will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the "" Rapture "" is imminent?",0

I was very disappointed with this film.,0
"He probably meant VERSE 24, but the film makers missed this slip up. This movie is one reason IMDB should allow a vote of 0 / 10. The script looks like it was written in haste. The acting is awful, even what some here have lauded, the Carpathia character!",0
OF COURSE THERE'S SPOILERS!!!!! Dear oh dear if only London transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here.,0
I like B - movies. This movie is just boring.,0
What? I cannot believe that they managed to spend US $ 17million on this film.,0

"And oh lord, the plane scene. "" MY HUSBAND IS MISSING! OH MY GOD!",0

"the premise is interesting, but its excution falls waaaay short. it has a TV - movie feeling to it.",0
I was looking for something bold. I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that. LOL!,0
"I am a Christian... and I feel this movie is awful. and start crying and yelling. The message is just too in your face. Brad Johnson was laughable. RIDICULOUS! People are missing! they disappeared! Watch Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. < br / > < br / > Poor direction. "". they're missing! """,0
"So, if you view it, view it as a social / cultural document. And that, perhaps, makes the movie important.",0
Just how commercial did this film prove. Yet another example of the complete waste of UK Lottery money. It's a little bit too late then!,0
"If you've watched this movie, chances are you read the book. < br / > < br / > The plot needs no reprising. Really.",0
"What can you expect from a low - budget, "" B "" movie? It's been a while since seeing this the first time, so I watched it again with the second movie in the series.

"For one thing, it radically deviates from the book. In the film it's quick and artificial. < br / > < br / > Another thing, there is zero character development. Left Behind fell woefully short on this. Perhaps it would've been better to make the first book into 2 - 3 films.",0

I will now spoil the ending so anyone who doesn't want to know it stop reading now. From saying why did they stand around & argue, why didn't they pick the axe up & such things, I The teens are even more annoying & stupid than usual, the script is more moronic, predictable & flawed than usual & the killer Lumberjack dude is just lame.",0
Absolutely laughable film. I live in London and the plot is so ill - researched it's ridiculous. No one could be terrorised on the London Underground.,0
"Where to start, this movie started badly and ended badly! I gather you've got gist by now so i'll leave it up to you to decide.",0

It isn't the narcotic effect of a truly hypnotic or thought provoking movie. That is not a compliment.,0

"For instance, TWO is shot like a 70s French policier. This can be seen in the pattern of the two movies. This lent a new vigour and complexity to a weary medium, and, in the best of them ( eg BONNIE AND CLYDE, early Scorcese ), a new subversion of received practice. TWO is old Hollywood's right - wing reassertion of American values. He even misreads < br / > < br / > TWO seems to follow the original by undermining its detective hero.

2 / 10 Definitely the worst Carpenter has ever done.,0
i love the long cut. we get it john. absolutely trash.,0
NO! Ron Perlman is laughable. He just puts his head down and sulks out of room. You can pretty much see the material on the Satan costume.,0
Its a bit like renting horror movies from the video store - every now and again you get a good one and it makes it all worth while. I also wish they had negative rating options. The acting ( other than Ron P. ) was poor. Last season episode 13 was pulled due to the way it handled the abortion issue.,0
How low can you go?,0
A plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro - life and the other a destroyer of a demon's seed.,0

You don't see him very often, but when he's on screen he acts everyone else into a corner. In fact, I was wishing Mulder and Scully would turn up and sort them all out for me.

"He picked his nose. This has to be THE WORST film I have ever seen. There is no real plot to speak of and no real horror. < br / > < br / > But I thought it might be funny. The case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie, IN WHAT WAY?, disgusting production, acting. The production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the microphone.",0

Breats? okay, no gore. i've seen it in shops for 15 pound. < br / > < br / > I've bought a number of these previously banned films from the DVD company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this. DON NOT PAY THAT MUCH FOR THIS FILM! To begin with the acting is VERY VERY bad. What else can a film like this offer? < br / > < br / > Why is it so bad?",0

"Joe likes teenage girls, he has various porn magazines but enjoys the real thing even more. Sometimes a film comes along that is unique.",0
). No - budget and boring t & a. Remember - - this was a HIGH SCHOOL BOY!,0
Bad as in bad. This movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of'80's sex comedies. And then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrel.,0
Yep - - it's him under that beard. This was just sloppy writing - - period.,0
I could barely sit through it. This was an absolutely terrible movie.,0
50 at Walmart I purchased it. I don't think this scene added to the movie at all.,0
"She had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness, and self doubt just like the rest of us. An epic over the top speech as though from an inhuman robot. < br / > < br / > Clara Barton was a human being. The story obviously had potential, but that story is nowhere present in this film.",0
"Neither are particularly good. He's clearly not a wealthy vampire. Almost a two - person play, and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important.",0
"To be honest, i'm surprised by the positive votes that this film has received. ). She is given some pretty pathetic dialogue and she handles it pretty well.",0
"Fungicide "" is quite possibly the most incompetent, embarrassing, pitiful "" film "" I have ever seen. What I got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief. The end.",0
"Or laughing out loud frequently, as I did. Their idea of giant killer mushrooms are simply guys covered with beige colored sheets with what looks like trash can covers on their heads. If you aren't, stay away. If you are the sort of person who can get a kick out of a very bad movie, then I highly recommend this one.",0
"This was just horrible the plot was just OK, but the rest of the was was bad.",0
"More evidence that no one cared. < br / > < br / > No, Tarzan plays second banana to Bo Derek as Jane. This movie has no point but to show Derek naked.",0
I loved the commentary.,0
This is worst film ever made. She tracks him down ( how? ),0
< br / > < br / > And how did orangutan get to Africa? Bo's body can only get you so far. Maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps. Bo Derek will not go down in history as a great actress.,0
It was so boring.,0
I watched it again on tv a few years ago.,0
It made it seem like he's urinating on someone below him. It didn't make good sense at all. How did Tarzan get poisoned by the way? There's one scene in that I saw that everyone forgot to mention. This whole movie is screwed up. The group of cannibal tribe's men look caucasin. He must have wandered off the set of a much better film. Eww! Not To mention plotting.,0
"This category uses the character as a vehicle for, of all things, soft porn. Dad explains the legend About the only thing these two characters have in common are the name Tarzan and fact that they both have a wife named Jane. < br / > < br / > Well, this film is in a third category of Tarzan films, and I hope it remains a category of one because it's awful. Though her dad is supposed to have been missing for a long time, she finds him effortlessly. Some of the IMDb reviews address this point, but here's my $.",0
"This film is boring! But it got old real quick. < br / > < br / > You know what'worst? Tarzan the Ape Man has nothing else. He should have stayed with his strength. It's a real shame, no really, with the right direction and the right part ( see "" 10 "" ), Bo was okay.",0
"Definitely worst film I ever paid to see. < br / > < br / > The only positive I can concede is the lush location shooting. The snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent "" action "" sequences ever filmed.",0
There was only one reason for this movie.,0
"Trying for tongue - in - cheek sexuality, the Dereks lack finesse, snappy timing, and taste.",0
All the extras are Filipino.,0
"the only really bad movies are boring and tasteless. there are three kinds of bad films - the cheap, the boring, and the tasteless.",0
"But this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum - the tease is the only thing going on here ; at the time of its release and now. but if that's your excuse for giving this schlock a good rating you really should visit a porn store and stock up. < br / > < br / > It would be ridiculous to argue that movies shouldn't employ the sexual tease as ONE of many tools to draw in viewers. There's nothing inherently wrong with using films eased moral constraints to portray an erotic side to the Tarzan legend. Yes... Bo Derek and Miles O'Keeffe are beautiful ( um, congratulations on having a working libido. ) There's nothing inherently wrong with the premise that Tarzan doesn't speak.",0
"and, furthermore, is as inexpressive as one of the trees he dangles from at regular intervals throughout the film ’ s second half!",0
"! Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is awful.",0
"Alas, as they say, Mortals plan and God laughs. This is the movie's cue for Miles O'Keefe, a future B - Movie star, making a rather odd debut as loin - clothed Lord of the Jungle. It is a great tragedy that both Richard Harris and John Derek are no longer with us. Given some of Bo and Richie's dialog, though, this is probably not a bad thing. Unlike Johnny Weismuller with his pidgin English or Ron Ely who speaks the language fluently, the O'Keefe Tarzan is mute. But that shouldn't blind anybody to the fact that in 1981, a pretty ugly blotch appears on both men's CVs. It is said that when this film premiered in 1981, the Edgar Rice Burrows estate tried to take legal action against it.",0
And then : Orang Utans in Africa? < br / > < br / > But it has a few things going for it.,0
Back to the jungle. Oh look! Saves Bo.,0
?,0
This movie was boring!,0
There simply is not enough there. He also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking like Chaplin's tramp character.,0
"Just like the two needless sequels that followed this, this isn't even worth a laugh. Also, why did he always look like rotted corpse?",0
"Inevitably, men in his position get offered film roles that exist solely to capitalize on that. The film is obviously derived from "" Enter The Dragon, "" as are most martial arts pictures. During the early 1980's, Kurt Thomas was something of a hero in the United States.",0
"With all that's bad about the movie visually, the sound is actually pretty entertaining. It was probably born out of the frustration of 10 year olds who weren't allowed to see it for one reason or other. As a kid, my friends and I all believed that Gymkata was the most violent, bloody movie ever made. Could it be headed for cult - classic status? Where is MST3K when we need it? I'm not sure who started that rumor. Never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume!",0
"or "" Ha!, your through! """,0
I was a writer on Gymkata.,0
Only the decision to cast Tara Reid as a scientist tops the dumbness here. Twice. Only in the 80's could a movie with such a bad idea get made.,0
But there's lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey.,0
Whew. What can be said about Gymkata that hasn't already? This is nothing but pure halarity from beginning to end.,0
Huzzah! Wow. A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And don't forget that his father was an operative.,0
To be avoided at all costs.,0
It's a lousy piece of crap. What's wrong with this film? I think you get picture.,0
Not as long as this movie.,0
But not the bad kind of bad movies. Makes for an evening of fun.,0
"Second, we have the WORST EVER sound effects ever used in a movie!! ! ), and overall execution of the plot are weak. I'm not kidding.",0
"As such, I'm actually rather fond of it. is at least as bad, or even worse, and most of them are professionals. Everyone else in the film - actors, director, editor, camera guys, etc. < br / > < br / > I hope poor Kurt took money and ran.",0
"The ending... meh. Still there's the germ of a good action adventure here. See other reviews for the many howlers throughout. Jonathan is trained in the martial arts by Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves the house. The so called script is just this side of incompetent.",0
"How this movie escaped the wrath of MST3K I'll never know. "" They can be found in the movie's strange details. with paper - thin plots, dumb characters, and preposterous situations. < br / > < br / > Sounds promising doesn't it? It has to be seen to be believed.",0
I really don't get all the adulation that this film has received. It is also rather offensive.,0
"First off, the movie was not true to facts at all.",0
"Ron even goofs up on the possibilities presented by imagined realities. Everything else, including this, is too reliant on superficial junk. Don't even rent the DVD. < br / > < br / > Some spoilers. How else do you explain his rampage of disasters? < br / > < br / > Howard's commentary track is just awful.",0
It's so horrible I can't stop watching it! Jason Most is very questionable. Music was a little better than the acting. Some of the camera work is good. I think I'll skip!,0
What a sham!,0
"< br / > < br / > So, I feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud. It should be violently frightening. < br / > < br / > Schizophrenia is a mind structure, not a disease. It's not about * details *.",0
"When many people say it's the "" worst movie I've ever seen "", they tend to say that about virtually any movie they didn't like. Puke. This is my first movie review, by the way, and I registered with IMDb just to rave at this movie's badness. However, of the nearly 700 movies I can remember ever seeing this one is one of two that I walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry. The special effects, what few there are, look like they were done 15 years earlier. < br / > < br / > - - - Spoiler alert - - - < br / > < br / > Oh my, where to begin.",0
"The acting was terrible. The jokes make no sense. So watch it I did, for free... < br / > < br / > This movie is terrible. I don't need to go into plot details, read other reviews. Avoid! God - Awful even.",0
"An interesting try, but it misfires.",0
Horrible.,0
I hope the money was worth it.,0
"Once upon a time in the mid 1990s I used to write for DOCTOR WHO fanzines and the whole of fandom was holding its breathe about the new American produced DOCTOR WHO TVM. As soon as it was announced that the Doctor ` s arch enemy the Master was going to be played by Eric Roberts everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed "" Who is Eric Roberts? I know nothing about fencing ( Everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence or not.",0
But putting bad fencing in a movie doesn't make it bad automatically. I liked those movies. This is just a bad movie.,0
"The special effects are cheesy as heck. And the sequel to it, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse!",0
What a waste of F. Murray Abraham's talents.,0
"There is no reason to smile. It was lowdown slapstick, but it did have brains.",0
There is no real drama.,0
< br / > < br / > It just doesn't work at any level and is just a giant bore. Even the one - liners seem to have deserted him.,0
"Oh well! < br / > < br / > Finally, the hero - played by Chen Hui Min.",0
But that's it.,0
The acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it. So excited it had finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed.,0
"He goes on to kill many people, afterward. He adds a punchline to every kill, too. No laughing here. Her father, the sheriff, yelled to the madman to stop, and he said "" Hey, stay awhile! """,0
"If you like extremely gory movies, this is for you, if not, stay away. Again, the story has a sort of amateur feel to it, like the writer didn't take a long time to perfect it. Blood looks like red Kool - Aid.",0
this was not a surprise. there is some really stupid scenes in this. Well. keep looking gore hounds. many people will tell you this is gory.,0
"I'll get to the movie in a minute. Whaddya mean "" we "", paleface? When in truth, most of Clinton's "" Facts "" added up to guacamole. Like all his statements during his presidency, he IMPLIED that we deserved 9 - 11. The Marines didn't storm the Temple Mount.",0
There are apparently many others.,0
"They didn't happen! From there on, reliance on facts rapidly decays. Inform? I had never heard of this movie before seeing it. I saw this film on the History Channel today ( in 2006 ). The movie got that right. There is internal conflict, to be sure.",0
So what was it? No. Was it a'food fr thought'as the author was maybe trying to make it?,0
"< br / > < br / > And what's with the titles of this and some of the other late Stooges shorts? Joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about this. I'm not a big fan of the Stooges'slapstick, but I find their history interesting.",0
"He had a definite track record for being very funny and clever. Just look at history of the other teams and tell me I'm wrong. Obviously, nothing.",0
I completely wasted my time watching this film.,0
"The actors, I'm assuming, are supposed to be in college. The effects are, of course, poor. It makes no sense.",0
"< br / > < br / > 4. If you're a Toby fan you'll love the songs. ( And indeed, their characters get lost in this film! ) The editing didn't help this mess at all. Kelly Preston's acting chops are pretty rusty and it shows. It's a shame he didn't have more screen time like that.",0
"But that's not saying much. It barely lasted two weeks in theaters anyway. < br / > < br / > Bad acting, bad writing, and poor production only begin to describe this embarrassment of a film. Eesh.",0
The only star is for her. < br / > < br / > The story itself then? And poor Captain Hook a TOTAL clown. The Darling parents don't even get the time to notice their kids are gone!! ! This movie makes Wendy a babbling idiot. ( Even though to his shoes and it makes no sense to me. ),0
"Avoid this crappy film at all costs. Honestly, I wanted all of them to die. This sequel is a really bad film which kept me tremendously bored and uninterested.",0
The film never generates any tension nor rises above level of a forgettable TV movie.,0
One day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They were hired to find two big containers. Into The Blue 2 is a sequel only by name. < br / > < br / > Next day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing.,0
Miscasting happens.,0
"I like George C. Scott as an actor, but this simply did not work. He could have at least tried to do a British accent. They could just as well have been cited by statues. Now these two are brilliant adaptations. This was in short a terrible disappointment.",0
The ending is ludicrous. G. C. Scott is laughable. Dalton is superb as Rochester.,0
We'sending this one back. 32 it was a gyp.,0
It's just bad film making at it's worst. Like 30?,0
"The script is bad, the portrayal of the characters is untrue to the novel and nearly all actors are miscast. < br / > < br / > This Jane Eyre for example completely leaves out Gateshead and begins with Jane's arrival at Lowood. And this is about all which happens at Lowood. But even if the editing were better, the film would not be. This TV production of 1970 starring Susannah York and George C. Scott is another proof of how difficult it is to adopt "" Jane Eyre "" to the screen, and how much can go wrong in doing so.",0
"I have never seen such an awful portrayal of Mr. Rochester. Where is his wit? The cinematography is very moving, as is the music.",0
"< br / > < br / > Avoid at all costs. If so, they failed utterly. It just bored me, and I wish I had never watched it.",0
"Maybe this is the only good thing. Everybody happy except the audience. If there is only one film you have to miss, this is the one. Hope you fall into neither group. < br / > < br / > The plot is particularly weak.",0
( I am not against violence in film. There are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have overstated this. So too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke ( a serious and moral filmmaker ) here labels this as one of most moronic films in years.,0
The references to Iraq were either bizarre or just not thought through properly. Shocking that this film is considered for an award at the Gijón Film Festival. Badly made.,0
"Describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art. Use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right. The interesting thing would be : how does it work? He will get a lot of negative critics. People don't like it. How does a shy boy come to such a cruelty? I can see that difference. Film - technically it's a good one. I think it's a simplification to call him selfish. But : the world is cruel like this, and it's not funny.",0
""". At the end of the film I just asked myself : "" is it the worse movie I have ever seen or is it the worse movie I have ever seen?",0
"No one can save poor Robert. The film shows male peer group extremism pushed to it's limits. This is Clay's first film, I would be delighted if is his last.",0
The dialogue is so flat and truly one - dimensional. First a technical review. is really non - existent.,0
trust me watch it!,0
"The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace ; one loses hope for it early on. ). At this point, Matthau was still too young for role, and he over - compensates by slouching and hollering. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. There's not a drop of sunshine in "" The Sunshine Boys "", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon's sole ironic moment.",0
"This film should have a big WARNING label on it. This is the most disturbing film I have ever seen. However, the concluding gang rape scene is the most appalling and violent thing I have ever seen and I really wish I had not seen it. For these reasons I would not recommend anyone seeing it. You've been warned.",0
"If a feeling can be vacuous - this is it. However, the film has a look which can draw you in. I have seen it.",0
< br / > < br / > Don't waste your time. It was awful!,0
"Violence whether real or not always has an impact. But what was the point? The violence looks like a mix of Noë's'Irreversible, and'Kubrick's'Clockwork Orange '... both of which are remarkable films. In this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for. !",0
A comment on the film itself perhaps? This film has a truly dreadful script.,0
"yet he has filmed the most disgusting piece of SIMULATED violence. < br / > < br / > Shame on all involved. All anyone will want to see is the most hideous scene from end of the film and I am sure that will be what sticks with people. Robert falls in with bad lads and starts missing school and taking drugs and before you know it he is a psycho rapist. Thomas Clay has been mixing with the wrong types. That's the trouble with young people these days, they have no respect. Clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our TVs. Is this guy for real?",0
"At least in my opinion. See "" A clockwork orange "" or "" Le pianiste instead.",0
He assumes the audience are ignorant of world atrocities. Appalling. Like the British tabloids this film portrays young people with no aspirations or respect. < br / > < br / > This is Cray's first film. The community is represented as dysfunctional. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is creepy. The female characters in the film offer no relief. There is just one word for this film.,0
"When pushed, Robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside him. This was not an overly'shocking'film.",0
"Scarecrow is stupid. I saw this not too long ago, and I must say : This movie is terrible. That's right, 8 days. I watch crappy movies for fun. Boyfriend chases kid into corn field. Wah. "" Kid was killed under a scarecrow, though.",0
At the end of movie.... it rains. Spoiler alert!,0
"I stayed only because I had another show after it. I think it was a big mistake choosing this style for characters. That was not the case here. Those characters in the movie were made out of "" cloth "", and that just didn't work! It was stiff, boring, almost lacked any imagination or mood. It just had a feeling of a 3D shoot'n'run computer game. Actually the story was the worst thing in that movie.",0
"But, IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was kind of pretty. Time that you will never get back. Jurassic Park 3 was pulled off better than this movie.",0
Horrible. Nazi's???? This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies. < br / > < br / > Just awful.,0
"What?!?? It was one of the shortest movies I've ever seen, and thank god! I admit the movie had it's parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. But a lot of it was clichés one after another. Why are people saying this is "" mind blowing? "" 4 left and the whole world has ended!",0
"I would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good. 9, the film I've been looking forward to for months.... was little more then a disappointment. < br / > < br / > A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth.... Which... is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect.",0
"I had waited 7 months for the movie to come out. I had no idea what was going on, let alone what it was about. I felt heartbroken to even have felt that way. I seriously can't believe Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, two people I LOVE, signed on to produce this crap. I really did. But no, it failed on so many levels. Well, OK, that's what I got from it. I've only seen those three of his, but they prove he's an awesome director. I was so excited to finally have seen it.",0
"type of exit. Evil humans use it as a weapon. It sucked. eh, kinda bland. Science isn't portrayed any better. Plot? However, the scientist realizes that he is also at fault. < br / > < br / > Okay... SPOILERS follow.",0
You can skip this one without missing a thing. Not.,0
"Whats worse is that she had to watch this $ % & @ thing TWICE! HE dint come over, SHE had too. I hope it was because of this film. You might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself.",0
I was very Disappointed. This movie was a real disappointment to me.,0
"If you had never heard of the real story of Gram Parsons then it might seem a reasonably entertaining diversion. Michael Shannon is due credit for pretty much the same reasons, except he's a hippy stoner. First of all, this movie isn't a complete disaster. The character of Robert Forster as Gram's actual father is an invention so disgraceful as to cast a taint over the entire film.",0
"God, it was cringeworthy. What were they thinking? Awful plot contrivances? Check. Stupid hippy? Where to start? Scene with Knoxville.",0
If you're a fan of the late Gram Parsons then this movie is definitely going to divide you!,0
"Wow! That's O. K., no one knows that. But Parsons'was married at the time. Mythology?",0
What could have been clever and moving was campy. I doubt this will ever even be a cult film. There was no background on Gram or the colorful people of that era.,0
"Imagine "" Englebert Sings Hendrix "". I wish I hadn't. If Gram were alive and saw this movie, he would kill himself. I cringed all the way through this movie. < br / > < br / > I cannot say enough bad things about this movie.",0

Either way he's a political coward and party man to the bitter end.,0
The only real question to answer about Scarecrow is whether it's any fun to watch on dumb teen slasher type level? The answer is a resounding no to be honest.,0
Al Gore is a politician. The political appeal is just too great. And a very successful one at that.,0
"He just took a huge career risk in not toeing the line of the Greens and other Kyoto worshippers and told the truth as he researched it. < br / > < br / > So who's a stooge..? Something that really does not go down right with Al Gore ( and his supporters )'s theory is the whole thing about "" concensus "".",0
"Hell, even 50 - 60 years ago? Let's be honest shall we? BUT can they tell you with any degree of certainty WHY? The answer is we don't & Science is NEVER a consensus. Or that man is THE sole cause of it? Thirty years ago, Time Magazine did a cover proclaiming a "" New Ice Age "". What did they have, a June bug in a match box? A second flaw, just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago ( the toilet wasn't even invented yet )? It's a hook! So much for conservation huh, Al?",0
"And to title it as a "" truth "" is just plain crap. It is so uncredible, in fact, that it may be the single biggest hoax in the course of human existence. The reason it is so important for people to educate themselves is the disastrous economic impact that global warming prevention measures would have. There is no in - depth analysis to make, really. Don't drink the cool - aid. Wake up people.",0

"There were two suspenseful scenes in the film, but didn't last long enough to be scary at all. I suggest renting this movie for the death scenes, i wont see it again anytime soon, but i enjoyed the excessive violence. With all the excessive violence in this film, it could've been NC - 17. Also, don't bother with the sequel, i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death, it sounds good but isn't. If gore was actually fun to see, then it would've been nc - 17.

Yeah. Beyond the mood, there's not much anything else here. We gave movies 2 hours running film time for a good reason. I consider the Lynch style of movie making cheating. It is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium.",0
"Obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all. Definitely, The Broken is not one of those movies.

The dialogue is false false false. Perhaps I'm not a sophisticate. And boring.,0
Worse than this there'no fluidity. Drama?,0
this movie is just an excuse for the writer to make a film out of 2 failed scripts. This film had no snakes.,0
This movie stinks!,0

"Utterly pretentious nonsense. It appears that the morose 70 - year old Allen should have knocked off work when the clock rang in a new century. The day turned out pretty well after all, no thanks to Woody.",0
The plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together. Two are play writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers. Than we begin to see the two points of view. There are some nice performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell but they can't fit it together on there own.,0
"However, the film then continues on for a whole other hour. You would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film. Also the main idea I would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together. Then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery. The first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine. They have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind. Yeah OK. With this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again.",0

Definitely a long way from the Allen we know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.",0
"Possible spoilers. Nice cast, but a disappointing film.",0
The outcome was obviously ludicrous. A vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds.,0
"Amanda Peet did well, but again, didn't have the room to move in this otherwise corpse like movie.",0
Woody Allen has lost his ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly distinguishable from each other.,0
I couldn't wait to see this movie. It was so annoying. I think that his writing was just as bad as his direction.,0
"< br / > < br / > "" Really? How would you answer? An art gallery? You be the judge. Or really really poor character writing? who would've thought it? """,0
"Where did your creativity go??? Depressing and same old, same old. Woody, I've seen these characters already, I've seen the storyline from you ten times already. You need to open your eyes and look around you. I am so disappointed.",0
"And how many actors can he get to stand in for his own neurotic, compulsive uber - New Yorker persona? < br / > < br / > This a tired formula, and proof that Allen isn't really a great film artist at all.",0
"Woody is the best at being Woody. This type of thing only pulls the audience out of the story. However, when he's at his worst his movies can stench of pretentiousness. The comedy is the story that has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting. Now that would have been interesting. The two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories that they weave. They are entirely different stories with major plot differences. The set up is one of his more intriguing ideas in a while.",0
"Unfortunately, her role required no. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film.",0
This is a movie with one voice. Again.,0
That's basically all the plot that this movie has.,0

"< br / > < br / > I'll give you £10 if you don't go to see this film. Wow, I knew this film was going to be bad but not this bad. This happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene. Spoilerific comments ensue.",0

What were they thinking?,0
"There is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of movie. Well, it isn't. But even she wasn't that great in this. The bottom line : this movie is not scary. All the actors in this movie are awful, except Faye Dunaway, who is always a joy to watch.",0
Another problem with the movie is the ending. They are seen as property and investment.,0
). I wanted to like it.,0
"I'm not that brave, I know, so it must be the movie itself that is the trouble. ... cause they're both pretty lousy. SPOILER!!! Here's the weird part - - the relative looks like she's just endured her eight hundredth birthday party. There, it's right out in the open. This movie sucks. What's more, Jennifer wasn't scared either. It seems that the family is plagued by an None came. I was suspicious at first, Faye playing a grandmother and all, and I was still suspicious at the end.",0
"Don't bother. Quoth Raven, "" Nevermore. """,0
"But they do. This movie was a littttle confusing at first. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, which she tries. It was about Jennifer Cassi ( Phillips ) who comes to her twin sisters funeral. Love ya.",0
What is his interest & motivation for getting involved? I couldn't see it. Is it an ancient family curse? The character's are all uninteresting & fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do. I mean for this sort of mystery based horror / ghost story it's surprisingly predictable & routine.,0
She also begins to have troublesome recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven.,0

"I don't think the message involved is good for women or gay men. This movie was amusing at times, hell sometimes it was even downright funny. Even if I don't agree with it, they are still entitled to it. Best film ever my foot.",0
"Too bad, this film doesn't contain any of this and every joke misses spot. My expectation were to high apparently. Plot is unimportant.",0
It is not very interesting to me. The film does a complete 360 going from one generation to next.,0
"What is this world coming to. I'm speechless. Well, what can i say about this movie.",0

Gayniggers from Outer Space is pretty much summed up by its name. But its illogical and holds little long - term value. Some parts are hilarious.,0
"< br > < br / > I'm glad its over. The music there was was annoying, and boring. Twenty minuets into a films and I'm praying for an ending.",0
"Not what you expect from seasoned film makers at. However, the animation in this film was about all I enjoyed.",0
"A huge bust. But the Brothers fail miserably to bring it to life. My God, it's awful here.",0
"It's amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. Price is wickedly enjoyable, and Mancini more professional than the material deserves. It starred one of the best film villains of all time, was based on a beloved series of children's books, and was a Disney Studios production. They bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity. As it turns outs, almost everything.",0
The plot is slow and lacking. The Good Earth is perhaps the most boring film I've seen in my life. The only saving grace I found with this film is it's production value. The acting is borderline comical.,0
"However, it has little to say. I have seen about a thousand horror films. Save yourself pain! For me, an idea drives a movie.",0
whoever wrote this script didn't know much about psychology. nothing could be further from the truth. i detest such concepts because they add to public idiocy. i liked the way witch used men ; it was a nice change.,0
"Imagine what this film could have been like with a decent budget! Overall, it strains for champagne tastes on a beer budget.",0
"As she meets other odd characters, she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs. The scenes of early 70's Manhattan look very good, as does the lead actress. The movie seems to be meant as an off - the - wall, irreverent comedy, but adds an avant - garde feel. But this is what filmmakers gave us. I didn't find it to be unique or creative so much as forced and pretentious. It is a very crisp black and white, which could almost make the movie feel undated and fresh.",0
"These three characters were totally unrealistic. No bones, nothing. This movie was horrible. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Thats ridiculous. The setting was unrealistic. This movie was bad.",0
"Instead of watching the light show Regina Belmont ( Catherine Mary Stewart ) decides to spend the night with cinema projectionist Larry Dupree ( Michael Bowen ) in his booth... Night of the Comet starts as the world prepares for a once in a lifetime event, the passing of a 65 million plus year old comet. I'm not having the fact that the two sisters survived independently of each other, I mean what are the odds on that?",0
Suffice to say that I was right first time.,0
I somehow get sucked into really bad movies.,0

"They've both sold themselves out in this one, worse than Pryor's character.",0
No plot!,0
"I feel bad for two actors whose legacy is marred by this disaster that should never have been made. Maybe my sense of humor has become too refined... Not that it was any gem to start with. I'm not so concerned with the racial controversy, as I wouldn't mind seeing a movie take that issue on with a little levity. It has a very few memorable moments, but the well dries up quickly. The comedic might of Pryor and Gleason couldn't save this dog from the tissue - thin plot, weak script, dismal acting, and laughable continuity in editing this mess together.",0
Talent is not a consideration. It ends at the ludicrous. behind this mess.,0
There was nothing original about any of the skits. Yet his role turned out to be so minor that you cannot even notice him on - screen.,0
And nearly all are directed without any artistry.,0
"Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30 sec skit. Wow... < br / > < br / > I'm all for bawdy humor, but this humor wasn't pleasantly vulgar, or ribald... it was just mind - numbing. I could not imagine a more mind - numbing movie.",0
"I chuckled once or twice in the beginning, much to my chagrin.",0
"For what it tries to be, it'not too bad.",0
Pure magic.,0
"Some will love this, others will just find it very, very loud. Ignore the Oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or something - - anything else! So as a result, lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend wasn't reversed until the 1980s. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, it's not a particularly good film for me, either! < br / > < br / > This UPA film is one of the early ones. After all, the films were dirt cheap to make and they'd received several Oscars to "" prove "" that the cartoons were now mainstream.",0
"The ones that give it over one - star must be Buffy fanatics. I just saw this movie yesterday... On every level, this film is terrible. No logic whatsoever in cinematic terms. ( Also, estate of Patsy Cline should sue for defamation! )",0
"). Long on shelf, this "" Soldier "" is best left forgotten.",0
Adam Sussman's screenplay is downright moronic. Its just plain unpleasant. They need immediate medical attention if they do. Its not compelling. Joanna is now on a desperate search for answers. I assume this is why the acting was so awful. At least that's what I'm choosing to believe.,0
Or maybe I'm wrong and that was just a flashback. With this movie it's impossible to tell.,0
I can't believe that any sane human would like it. It was a joke. The theatre I was in maybe had 4 other people. It is all such trash. There was no plot NO PLOT AT ALL. This movie is an absolute mockery to all of mankind.,0
I recommend that all of you just skip the first step and go see good movie instead.,0

I am just forewarning you about possible suffering. so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless. who am i to stand in your way.

I guess Disney can only plagiarize itself!",0
Baby Melody is hideously horrible! But the new characters are just not interesting.,0
"And I don't like her. This isn't the Ariel I know. The Little Mermaid is one of my absolute favorite Disney movies. That was what we loved so much about her. Ursula spoiled us with her believability for badness. This sea witch is a joke. But for me, and for I felt that this plot lacked imagination. I'll admit it has some good points to it. The songs aren't bad, and the animation is clean and clear.",0

Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody who isn't satisfied with life on land. I was horribly disappointed. < br / > < br / > There's also a whole load of other new characters - Tip and Dash being two of them. She wants to become a mermaid.

The sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water. < br / > < br / > The music is more emotionally moving in the first. < br / > < br / > Like the first movie, Melody has a lot of Ariel's problems, except reverse.

"They finally prove themselves. She makes friends with a penguin and a walrus and here is where it is awful. This is where there is similarity. you know why? Meanwhile, Eric, Melody and King Triton look for her. That does not suit the little mermaid. Did Ursula have a sister?! When they take trident, Ariel finds Melody with Morgana. Poor Ariel and Melody are in her custody.",0
"the plot is so predictable. Ariel - Ah, Ariel. Hes really bad too. I'll take you through the horror of it step by step. She has the same voice ursula did. Yawn. Flounder has about 2 lines.",0
It's pathetic and simplistic. And the dialogue is atrocious. Morgana is another Ursula. Do yourself and your Little Mermaid fan a favor. I almost did.,0
"Melody manages to screw things up. Eric is a total wuss. So, now that I'm 16, and feeling masochistic enough, I decided to rent this movie. Ariel sort of does something. The songs bite. Ever.",0
Right?,0
"It was terrible and stupidly predictable. Nice one. And the music, don't even get me started. It was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral.",0
"Okay... so i've seen a lot of really odd / unusual movies in my day. It kind of hurt my brain a bit. Slipstream is what i'll say! And I don't mean "" unusual "" in a good way. Fear and loathing in Las Vegas comes to mind when I think of that.",0
This movie was a complete waste of time. We ended the movie with a rousing chorus of expletives I will not reprint here.,0
"Ultimately I feel cheated. I have to say it felt a LOT longer than its 96 minute runtime, and not in a good way. Or...",0
"< br / > < br / > You see I am a nobody, who hoped for better. So my comments are as'straw in the wind '. Movies need to be moderated to retain a semblance of credibility. To yes, suspend belief for a brief period. It is fraught with danger.",0
I could not have been more disappointed by this move. The actors were very good but it was such a waste of talent.,0
"Some of the dialogue is unbelievably good, and unbelievably bad all at the same time. It fits perfectly. I rented this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. I wrote a scathing review on my movie review blog that essentially gives everything away, and I won't do that here.",0
This movie was a disappointment.,0
5 hours in the film.,0
"Also, shame on Christian Slater! ! Shame on you Mr. Hopkins!",0
< br / > < br / > His quote of stating that he made the film as a joke says it all. What a muddled mess.,0
"Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something? 3 ) The killer is too good, how did he develop all of his skills? WHAT THE HELL?",0
It never happened! The only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice. This movie was awful. That's it. Their performances were excellent! The entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time.,0
"I don't need to watch it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, big time.",0
Schitzoid. ! Sounds like lion a red light with seeing hair.,0
"All of those involved throw themselves into their roles, even if they probably have no idea what they're actually doing. What the punchline to this particular joke is, only Anthony Hopkins will ever know. '. Anthony Hopkins, however, decided to make possibly the strangest movie anyone has ever seen. "" It's a joke on the audience.",0
Hopkins's film is an experiment. < br / > < br / > It could be about a screenwriter intermingle with his own characters. Maybe. Slipstream is the latter. There are no characters.,0
5 hours of my life watching this? Why did I waste 1. Why was this film even made? Why am I even commenting on this film?,0
"Overacting, shouting and threats were delivered in comic book fashion. Well I'm afraid there was nothing to get. A confused mess from start to finish. I think one dimensional was an overstatement.",0
"The result proves that he has by far not enough experience or skill to achieve the desired result. < br / > < br / > Sir Anthony you aimed for the stars, but unfortunately missed by a couple of light years. Please stick to acting, in that department you are a unequaled giant nobody should ask more from you, not even yourself!",0

"Well, very small kids will think this is good. The script is lacking.",0
"Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than watched. < br / > < br / > Rating : "" 4 "" of "" 10. "" It sets tone for his later trials as a commanding officer.",0
A plot that will probably put you off going to see this. It's clear Hollywood Horror is dead.,0
"They did. < br / > < br / > Better by far is Mike Leigh's magnificent "" Secrets and Lies "" ( qv ) which touches on the same subject matter, but with Brenda Blethyn playing far superior part.",0
"You either wished he'd lay off the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers. I won't waste your time with the plot, you may read other reviews. I will say though that Berkowitz's hyper, Woody Allen - style narration was extremely annoying.",0
"If date suggests seeing this film, run. It is neither.",0
Don't think I couldn't like this movie only because of that anyhow.,0
"< br / > < br / > Yes, naive boys and girls, "" 20 Dates "" IS a mockumentary, although I am not absolutely certain that was Myles Berkowitz's intent when he started. Living off his rich parents? No clue! ) As a result, the whole thing has an uneasy, cheap and insincere feeling about it. Even in the world of the movie, his ex - wife divorced him for never being employed. .... ripoff of a dozen better films. ( Is he drug dealer?",0
Jokes wear thin quickly and you find yourself suddenly not caring how this man's dates progress. It first of all presents itself to be the humorous exploits of a real - life divorcee trying to find love in LA.,0
You end up feeling sorry for his dates.,0
The comedy is spotty at best ; the rest is mishap after mishap.,0

"The main reason I did not like this movie is because of the story. This movie is probably good for a few laughs, but not much more. It was on AMC one late night, and I'm glad I saw it for free.",0
The Martian landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing.,0
"After all, those producers had to count on the audience coming back. And it's a bad one - - as rib - thin as the plot. Even Mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a prop. Surely no Saturday morning TV kids'show was ever done this poorly.",0
"But bad acting aside, movie just falls apart when they land on Mars via flashback. It is really fascinating to see how far we have come as a civilization. Whew! These are bad. Watch Tremaine as he utters that scientific nonsense! Most of the stuff they used in the movie is so outdated.",0
The bat / rat / spider is highlight.,0
The movie is pretty slow too. The killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too. Well thats just my opinion. i gave it a 2 / 10. I think it was an overrated PG - 13 crap!,0

"MST3000 made it's living off that. OW "" indeed! All the elements are there : the pseudoscience, occasionally logical, more often hilariously infantile. The comic relief, an overweight astronaut (! ) And of course, the mere fact that alien = dangerously evil. I rated this movie low.",0
"Oddly, while the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the silliest I have seen on film. Plus, he sounds and acts a lot like him, too. For lovers of the genre, it's well worth seeing. What happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member. Plus, in an odd attempt at realism, the production used a process called "" Cinemagic "".",0
I agree with the statement that bad sci - fi is comical. Get comfy and enjoy. Pretty cool.,0
"It would at least be pretty funny, unintentionally, if the story didn't drag. But I don't think it fools anyone over 10 years old. Nice going, lady. Most of the picture is a flashback to what transpired over there.",0

I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan. I decided to watch it myself earlier this week. Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out.,0

The one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. Instead of twisted, hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. The movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt. Justice is mocked. The police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scowling compared to the GQ murderers.",0

Mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. This is not the fun romp The Love Bug was but it is watchable.,0

"It is possible to keep up with what's going on, but only because there's so many other films that follow similar plots to this one. The girls on board complete what is a pretty picture, and what Rollin's film lacks in logic and consistency, it somewhat makes up for in style. There is a twist thrown in at the end also ; but the film would have been better without it. French director Jean Rollin isn't exactly known for great films, and this confusing mess is one of the reasons why. The cinematography is fairly neat, with lots of the plot taking place in suitably Gothic locations. One of the most confusing things about this production is the title.",0
from the future! The eight Jean Rollin film I have watched is also possibly the weirdest ; the intriguing plot ( such as it is ) seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along!,0

And besides, Phantom of the Mall could have used at least a bit of humor!! < br / > < br / > I'll try to finish with a few positive aspects... Like for example, it stars Ken Foree!! Even though his role in this movie is limited and even completely unnecessary... it was good to see him again. There are a few innovative killings but they're not satisfying enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie. On the bright side, Gaston Leroux doesn't has to turn over in his grave just yet. Also, the scriptwriters wanted to give too much draught to the story than necessary.",0
"Still, it seems higher than the movie deserves. I honestly wanted to say I was going to enjoy this one. Then, a killer is on the loose. If not her, than what other reason to watch this.",0
"Otherwise, keep on looking for something else. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule.",0
The acting is spotty at best. The plot really doesn't matter. Most of the movie is a total bore. They'll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways.,0
"To spice things up though, there's a simulated bestiality scene ( I HOPE it's simulated ) with a black goat, sure to be a crowd pleaser. I'm only noting the ones I've seen. Ugh. Not sure if it was good for either of them, at that point.",0
"The perverse nature of the scene is more implied than shown in graphic detail, heightened somewhat by the knowledge that said supplicant is actually the teen - aged daughter of the Satanic priest. No wonder Jose Larraz "" disowned "" it at one point and refuses to discuss it. It's too bad he never made a Western, his vision would have been perfect. All you have to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours, only watch out whom I absolutely despise this movie.",0

Sammy Horn ( Michael Des Barres ) is the head chef and owner of a famous restaurant in California. Lack of chances in better movies due to their ages?",0
"She played that role and as you watched the movie, you start to feel bad for her. Michael Des Barres did a good job considering what all he had to do, which wasn't much. There's something about beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me.",0
No reason to bother renting this flick.,0
"When...? It looks like a Saturday Night Live skit!! < br / > < br / > The directing is equally bad! The forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish.

Wow.,0
"It is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb, slap stick humor. It's hard to hear the same joke twice, but for a whole movie that is just pure torture. There is absolutely no diversity in Kattan's routine. The character of Corky Romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst. Why is this film so bad?",0
There is no'second level'of wit riding over slapstick. What I truly miss here is what always attracted me to the Leslie Neilsen movies.,0
Watch it only if you enjoy Venezuelan soap opera.,0
It's horrible. Let me start with what is actually good about this film. Where the heck did it go? Save the $ 8. I've seen films with budgets of less than $ 2 Million look better. Finance his retirement? Or what? I can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film.,0
"My vote is one ( awful ). The camera, framing, cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality.

"The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark ( especially "" Kids "" and "" Bully "" ), but Clark's films - - though also moralist and sexploitative - - are high - class masterworks compared to this crap. Moral and literal garbage, get it?",0

I'm afraid that I have to disagree with the majority. It just wasn't strong enough in the end. I found Spike Lee's latest a wee bit boring!,0

Horror movies can be a lot of fun with low budgets, bad acting, and a bit of panache. And the anticlimax is one of the unexciting endings to a movie I've ever seen. It spends the better part of an hour setting up faceless and anonymous characters with what seem like endless interpersonal drama.

There is no need to show almost the entire journey! Wow... < br / > < br / > I actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this.",0
"He is terrible in The Wicker Man, but in most wonderful kind of way. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature. See? "" It is a very good looking movie.",0

"It's unfortunate that you can't go any lower than one star. If you really want something along these lines, I heartily recommend M. Night Shyamalan's The Village instead.",0
You could probably for it show up on television. This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb. I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this.,0
"Wow! Willow's a funny name. And she kind of has my hairline. Honey, like bee, get it? < br / > < br / > Crash!",0
Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness. It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found.,0
"No. Some major aspects of the story needed to be reworked for modern USA - communications, paganism, virgins. If Edward Woodward was the the flicks watching this film then that's what he would scream out in horror. We had Get Carter, The Italian Job, Alfie and now this. Cops just don't go missing. The main common ingredient in those originals IS the britishness of the films. They weren't made to impress Hollywood.

Woo hoo! Review over. Everything about it is a mess. The really terribly bad horror film.,0
Seriously what were they thinking? Can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him? Also the overall is just totally different and more'modernized '. This is a very little interesting Columbo entry that also really doesn't know to entertain its viewers in any way. < br / > < br / > 4 / 10 It also makes the movie more and more unwatchable. It's such a stupid written kidnap - thriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely.,0
Directed by Uwe Boll.,0
< br / > < br / > So... about the film itself. The action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow.,0
"This should be my kind of movie. Tara Reid is hot. I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy. Super - natural enemies with quality FX. 4.",0
You guys are on. 50.,0
"Why is this question never answered? Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? Could this be it? Why was the opening text crawl incoherent? hand over 20 orphans to a madman? Why would a nun ( she sure seemed nice! ) Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver?",0

"The bad stuff wiped them out, but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key. There are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films, maybe 25. Some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost American Indian tribe. Well, I loved it. I even gave it a 10 out of 10!",0
"Yet, I understand why it was narrated. Are they good? Tara Reid is horrendous as an actress. One has very similar tastes to me, the other is an action / adventure flick guru. < br / > < br / > I went to see this film with two of my roommates. < br / > < br / > The plot is probably worst thing ever created by man. NO.",0
Lines were delivered as if from a robot. What a waste. The premise is laughable at best.,0
"However this comes from the fact that you can't make heads or tails of this mess. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us! This movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you've seen.",0

Very poor editing. Well where do I begin my story?? Boo.,0
"It gives the basic summary of what is going on. I have never played the video game, but know people who have. Save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters.",0
"Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening, if anything is.",0
I don't know where to begin. Slater sleepwalks through this dreck. < br / > < br / > Hands down worst film I've ever seen.,0
"Predator ( Yes, even that movie surpassed this ). At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball. I'll try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad. True, there are many movies much worse then this movie.",0
Avoid at all costs. The set design and special effects are poor. The main culprit is the director. Don't these guys get it?,0
"What's going on? "" Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. Definite not worth nine bucks though. I had a lot of fun watching it. They were here, now they're there.",0
Gah! I hope his series in future will improve on this one. The deaths of Rodriguez & Watros'characters was the final straw!,0
"This is a badly made, poor remake of Bimalda's classic Parineeta. The song and dance by Rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on. On these counts this movie deserves 3 stars.",0

The good guy ( = prince ) is a musician (! ) And it also refers to coke. < br / > < br / > Technically the movie is close to perfect. < br / > < br / > But : It's not a fairy tale. As I like other films He has problems with his parents. Thus as a spectator I remained untouched.",0

"In real life, the brilliant Levant spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions. ! Also, the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife ( Widmark and Graham ) had a lot of promise. Realistic, this film ain't! Subtle, this film ain't!! My wife and I disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competent. Also, Charles Boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place. In fact, it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of "" General Hospital "".",0
"Widmark and Bacall do have some good chemistry together, but this script gives them nothing to build on. ).",0
"Or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend? I don't understand why. It seems to be such fun that each character of story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another. And boy, does that film need wiseness!",0

This movie is a painful suckfest.,0
"That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class.",0
"This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story. There was not a hint of depth to her character, but then there probably shouldn't have been.",0
I think not. This is because the movie its story is highly unlikely. The movie is filled with moments like these. Everything is so formulaic in this movie. All of the other characters are a disappointment. It was cringing stuff at times.,0
I enjoy laughing at bad movies. I didn't know how bad though. It's bearable.,0
I was in such high hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like the Arabian Nights.,0

Sorry. The original show was so much better.,0

What else can I say about this...?,0
Thrown together plot. Makes no sense. This one is much worse.,0
"And when they do, get this, they're played by real tomatoes. Tomatoes kill people, the government tries to stop it, bad jokes are told. There is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny.

"This one, like moost spoofs, is pretty poor. There are sooooo many things wrong with this film... and so right, it's hard to explain. Many attempts at humor are dismal failures, and will induce much groaning. And dig those 70's clothes, dude!! Large chunks of time spent away from tomatoes are pretty dull.",0
"Yes, it can be done. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six - pack or two.",0
"I have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it. However, just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song don't a good comedy make. Perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a mock trailer, but no they indeed made full movie, and a rather weak one at that.",0
"Equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept. '. For a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once, one gag after the over. Sadly the title is about as funny as it gets. Ultimately, however, you can see why this film is a cult one ; I can't see many people beingdifferent to it. < br / > < br / > The acting is atrocious ; there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy.",0
"One tiny but essential detail, however, is that "" Attack of the Killer Tomatoes "" is deliberately awful. The first half hour of "" Attack of Killer Tomatoes "" is very entertaining.",0
"I don't believe I was induced to laughter, but mostly smiled and scratched my head. Be warned. The easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire. < br / > < br / > The plot is simple enough. I see this movie as a big influence on Tim Burton's Mars Attacks. Did I also forget to mention, lots and lots of tomatoes? They aren't that good and seem to be dubbed.",0
There aren't enough gay - themed movies and there aren't enough ` coming out'movies. A good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience. Every one is a welcome addition to the genre.,0

"The corny conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays a teenager Clark Kent in "" Smallville "". In addition, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is something shamefully ridiculous. My vote is four. The character of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a silly caricature.",0
< br / > < br / > They keep making Superman so small.,0
"Of course dialogs are disgrace. And special effects are not so special by the way. I can't believe somebody took money to write them. No offense. Anyone? In this case there is no quality at all. Kevin Spacey is having fun, but he's the only one. You actually feel, that this movie is way too long. What matters is that "" Superman Returns "" is bad movie. How many times laws of physics will be raped? No spoilers here. How many times we will be fed with villain making speeches? How many times Lois Lane will be fooled by Kent? How many times Hollywood producers will seek for a story in a trashy comic books?",0

The script jumps from place to place without giving much explanation. VERY confusing! Superman himself is weak and in need of Prozac. The beginning doesn't clarify if its a prequel or not. The movie is basically unwatchable.,0
And what about that Lex Luthor? Please!!,0
"I bet Henry Kissinger would have even won this Lois over before Clark Kent. I actually plagiarized their faces.

"So far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way. The acting is overdone and unconvincing, and I felt far more empathy for a cold - blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second. < br / > < br / > If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be sorely let down. I look forward to William H. Macy's installment, and hope he gets decent director and screenwriter for his segment.",0

The average King story takes place in the mind - scape of the characters in the story. The reason is simple. Oh well, better luck next time.",0

The crew is killed not long before a group of soldiers on a training exercise show up to find no one around. This is a movie that was made for the money and nothing else. I'm convinced that this film will only scare those who like the last Mimzy. You can fill in the rest.,0

"I mean, there's a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants. When I watched it on the movies I wanted my money back. < br / > < br / > A mess that let down the fans of the remake like me. Also, the gore is not that abundant and when it happens it's truly bad. You surely expect something different! The situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is truly awful.",0
"Also, Aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his French instant cult classic "" High Tension "", but who is this new director? Aja's "" The Hills Have Eyes "" was an unexpected hit, appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over - enthusiast target groups. The incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script. The remake came out barely one year ago and here's the sequel already?",0
My time would have been better spent watching Aja's remake for 5th time.,0
The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more.,0
"I always let out a groan of disappointment when a sequel replaces civilian characters with the military. He was also ably assisted by some genuinely talented actors. The latter half of the movie becomes just another tedious chased - through - dark - corridors scenario. Jonathan Craven's screenplay could have been written in a weekend, and given the speed with which this movie made it into cinemas, probably was.",0

"And if there is fault to his direction, it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance. The scenery budget could be charged to catering, Mr. Branagh eats so much of it. The brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless. It amazes me how Mr. Branagh "" mouthed "" it, but did not hear it. Shakespeare himself gives instructions to players in the text of "" Hamlet "" itself. Then there's Kenneth Branagh.",0

"The gags are repetitive, childish and déjà - vu. As for story, it's just too much! Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad!",0
This movie has one good part... its END! No attention to camera or shots in mind. Its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it. How this pile got through no one can tell. No script since it was apparently written and added to daily. This film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion.,0

Then it was adapted for a famous Twilight Zone episode featuring Inger Stevens. "" There is also some unintentional humor in this segment. Lois Chiles plays a cheating spouse, who ends up running over a hitch - hiker, or so she thinks. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the elderly store owners.",0
"This sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent! So why did I like them so much? All the stories were great though. It's shown on the Encore cable channel if your dieing ( yuck yuck ) to see it. com, lol.",0
"In end, the second story comes off best, but not by much. However, most of the characters are pretty thin overall. So why is the film a letdown? There are few surprises and no scares.",0
Having only three padded segments made for a boring feast. The two last stories are basically stretched out for too long. I saw CS 2 at the movies and the first segment was a real groaner.,0
"How could Hollywood knock that lock of hair back? The film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by Gornick. These two factors really added to my headache. Though, the direction is handed off to Michael Gornick. What a nice touchy feely time.",0

The choice is up to you. More often than not the director's abhorrence of the Church is clearly visible.,0
Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I don't know.,0
This film really disappointed me. And it's about actors. I liked neither. Unbelievable. The acting is atrocious. The film itself is rather prudish and preachy.,0
A dreadfully predictable ending to boot.,0
How do they manage to get actors to play in those movies??,0
Then it just abruptly ends. At least Dean had charm and Jerry had that animated face. Stick to Martin & Lewis.,0
"It was worse. I remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out. God knows what Noonan thought he was doing, but being funny sure wasn't it. There's barely one weak laugh in this whole incredibly stupid picture.",0

"I don't think so. < br / > < br / > Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom. Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa ( then, again, who is?

The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live. It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching.",0
"While Nora's story is played straight and is sombre in tone, Ismael's is played mainly for laughs, although it's not particularly funny. At other times treatment lapses into kitsch but the use of the anodyne "" Moon River "" as the film's theme tune suggests this is probably deliberate. Rois et Reine "" is a sprawling mess of a movie which will probably irritate as many viewers as it delights. It focuses by turns on ex - lovers Nora ( Emanuelle Devos ) and Ismael ( Mathieu Amalric ) as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives. """,0
And I really wish they'd install seats. The film's message is cliché. WRONG! Skip. The Circle - Vision is disorienting. NOT FUN.,0
The general sentiment of Indian superiority over the English in this film is foul. The character of Anita was drawn so appallingly - - almost the fallen woman trope - - that I finished the film feeling angry.,0

It's all totally mechanical, right up to ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends ( well not all of them, just the ones the movie thinks you care about. )",0
"There's really no "" disaster "" appeal or "" big - star "" draw to the film. What I didn't remember was HOW AWFUL IT WAS!!! ! < br / > < br / > That's basically the movie.

Only you can't really call it horror. It's all pretty ridiculous. Ants in the sink. Ants on the roof. Ants in the bedroom. Ehrr... What more can I say? Now Ants in the kitchen. It was just that Brian Dennehy made an appearance as a chief - fireman.,0
It has to be a mysterious virus. Ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel. This is a movie to avoid.,0
"I think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby, but don't quote me on that. This movie is a kind of combination disaster film / insect attack film with fewer notable stars in it. The plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants.",0

Really quite dreadful.,0
"This guy totally sucks. I swear the only guy that needs to shut f * * k up is Denis Leary. Thank god I didn't have to see him live. Not only was he invariably annoying to listen to, but he had NO jokes.",0
No chemistry. Sabato's character does not.,0
It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.,0
Even though there are a lot worse movies out. interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family. Even though there would be the potential judging by the random Backflashes. This is really a new low in entertainment.,0
"As for the biggest flaw of the movie, it is visual effects. Yes, I like Asian cinema too, but this is fact. It might be. Dramatically powerful critique. Some critics talk about it as if it is a Kurosawa movie.",0
"Let's hope it's the latter. This was a sharp - looking picture and sound was decent with a lot rear - speaker crowd noise. Now its "" environmental issues "" that are the focus. In here, it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this "" monster. "" In a nutshell, we get the familiar government cover - up story. It just drags the film down.

It wasn't funny.,0
"Rent Deep Rising. This movie is none of the above. I'm not kidding. < br / > < br / > Blech. Wildly entertaining. "", "" a seriously scary freakout. This was bad.",0

Hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisis!,0
"So, I really wanted to like The Host, but it wasn't to be. < br / > < br / > And lastly, film is clumsily political.

With in the course of 10 minutes you get the'why ','where,'and'how'of the beast and are ready for action.",0
"They were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic. I really, really didn't expect this type of a film outside of America. Hmm... Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves.",0
"Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? For Daniel Auteuil, ` Queen Margot'was much better. I think this movie was not disturbing, but very disappointing.",0
"The actors are attractive, and reasonably talented. Gimme a break. No other comparison between the two should be construed, however. < br / > < br / > Ah yes, the virus.",0
And we really tried to stick with it. That's the beauty of subjective art form of film.,0
"But the problem is that all of the afore mentioned directors display a level of erudite sensibility that is sorely lacking here. There is nothing new to be seen here. I don't know who this director thinks he is ; maybe he has pretensions of surreal like Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. What's worse is that it's colored like an episode of Miami Vice.",0
"The film failed to conveyed any kind of story or depth to character. - - a story to develop, or just for it to make some kind of sense. Neither occurred.",0
"One would think that a film about a young person's coming to terms with his burgeoning homosexuality would be anything but boring. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Think again.",0
"I HATE those! Then the credits roll! You will be very angry at yourself for paying to see this film, much less ever buying on DVD. Wild Tigers I have Known. "" I was waiting for it to make SENSE! It is one of those films SO artsy, that it makes no sense what so ever, except to the director!",0
"The rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when I was about eight or nine. Personally, I find van Sant's films to be dull, pretentious and facile. The frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid - especially with no father present - seemed real to me.

"What a flop. Whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school. < br / > < br / > Substantively AND stylistically, it all feels like a quirky dream sequence. How could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal?",0
They said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot. But no such luck!,0
"Well, there's surreal, and there's surreal. I don't mind imagery that doesn't mean anything, but these scenes just seemed irrelevant. The voice - over describes the movie as surreal. It didn't even come close.",0

To the end.,0
The world would be a better place without this film. Please! Maybe he got loads of money from the producers. Do not waste any money on this movie.,0
whatever it did have some hilarious moments. it's hard to describe.,0

This movie just has nothing going for it. There's one pretty decent murder somewhere in the middle, but then it's back to even more boredom, and especially more false scares.",0
"As far as the story is concerned, it can easily be explained in a few lines. Does that make it a work of art? The only thread to the killings is that all victims were matriculates of a common high school. Do you guys wanna know a secret?. This movie sucks. A bunch of teenagers go to Florida on vacation.",0

At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! His only funny quality was that he looked goofy - - surely not enough reason to put him on film. At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king.",0
"Worst of all, the conclusion really makes the whole movie pointless. Where are scares?",0
"What's wrong with this film? Many, many things. And did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film? Exactly. 1 / 10 At all? The acting is not even slightly impressive. The characters are poorly written and dull, uninteresting.",0

It's a ghost story. It's just so dull.,0
This flick's a major letdown. It's fairly good gore makeup there. There's nothing here. I can't stand the male leads.,0

If you can even call it that. One of the most boring slashers ever..,0
"The Forest "" is a weird and unusual film, to say the least. The main characters aren't ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards supernaturalism. It's actually a bit of an atypical 80's slasher!",0
"It came across like a'made for TV'drama. I couldn't even look during snogging scene. Sorry, but I didn't buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value. There were actually middle - classes who existed back then - just ordinary working people, with a decent wage and a mortgage. < br / > < br / > I felt that the film was very contrived.",0

"< br / > < br / > Ugh, major disappointment. Apparently VERY difficult for the writers here.",0
"I also thoroughly enjoyed Bad Santa. Not a great flick, and unlikely to become must - viewing for anyone's annual Christmas traditions. So sue me. My wife and I laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was obvious and Vince was just being Vince. There's nothing wrong with that. I like cheesy, schmaltzy movies.",0
Paul Giamatti brings some depth and warmth to the character of Saint Nick himself but he's forced to Vaughn's level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling infighting. You can see in Giamatti face that he's not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film.,0
"< br / > < br / > To put it in a nutshell, a major disappointment. I just saw this film tonight and I have to say that it's a mess. The story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but with North Pole as its setting.",0

Spend a useful 90 min.,0
"You don't get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters. And the plot evolvement is slow, boring and, yah i know what is about to happend in 30mins. Some of the special effects are nice, if it was made in early 90's. If you like Slimy Aliens, chills and thrills, don't whatch this movie.",0
It just does not mesh.,0
"Or maybe not, if you look at his career, for it seems he has invested his talents in more misses than hits. Its little wonder that this thing went straight to DVD. < br / > < br / > Its all been done before and done a whole To make things worse the film's pace is slow, there's almost no subplot, and the few action sequences are stereotypical and not that exciting. Hell, there's even cornfields and Antarctica, just like the recent ` X Files Movie '.",0

Julian Rome, a former SETI - worker, is brought in to decipher the message.",0
""". "" "" Look!",0
"Other acting is fine. It wasn't. Mostly, it bored me.",0
Were there a few pieces left out on purpose? What did they see in this very muddled story? A major misfire by Stanley Kramer.,0
"Vat do you zink? Then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely, so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly. OK, here it is : "" Nazi mountaineer befriends the Dalai Lama. """,0
"i remember the first time i saw it back in 98, i kinda liked it. I'm very disappointed by this "" adaption "" of the famous book. just like the whole story about harrers son, rolf. the young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone and nobody could see him! its about tibet.",0
I am a great admirer < br / > < br / > of the Dalai Lama. The movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth.,0
"But like Abernathy, it doesn't go anywhere. Then you've seen this. Nothing substantially innovative here, but it's okay. The main character is mildly sympathetic.",0
"To bad cause it had the best premise in bunch. Sure it failed miserably, but it tried. I wish I had.",0
"And eventually they have a chance at revenge and take it about as far as they can go. I need one of those things, it apparently gets GREAT mileage. That to those who released this film on an unsuspecting public. Of course the girls are scared to death & don't know what she's talking about. "".",0
"The story is terrible, alright I suspect it's meant to be minimalistic but this minimal? The reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the IMDb ( the amount of 1 Star comments is revealing & they can't all be wrong, right? ) Five Across the Eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew, they stop off at a store & accidentally hit another car & decide to just drive off & leave it.",0
i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone or even consider it.,0
It's a very sunny movie! Even the usually obnoxious Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's sidekick. One oddity however is casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. Kramer's direction is devoid of any style.,0
"< br / > < br / > The filming of the movie is absolutely terrible. That is all I can really say about them, and it did not help that they ALL survived. Whatever. < br / > < br / > The characters don't help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny, stupid bitches. Less than 10 minutes into this film I wanted it to end as it was painful.",0
"You've been warned! Seriously, it's THAT BAD. DO NOT waste your money or time on this piece of trash pretending to be an actual film.",0
Okay it nose dives off a cliff.,0
"Definitely, definitely the worst film I've ever seen, no questions asked! Used cleverly it can be breathtaking, but in this case it's an excuse for inadequate cinematography.",0
The film has no credit at all. Watching this Movie?,0
There is no plot. Don't do it.,0
"How come she didn't tell me ""? < br / > < br / > Okay, so the budget is low.",0
"All in all, one of the worst cheap horror flicks I've ever seen... and I've seen a lot. I'll keep this fast and sweet. < br / > < br / > Alright, they don't.",0
That was just really really stupid to even have that a movie. How much gas can a person siphon to get a van going? It was disgusting. There is also way too much poop and vomit in this movie.,0
There are no redeeming factors to this film : bad < br / > < br / > The camera - work is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable. < br / > < br / > I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality.,0
There are really two sections of this film.,0
"Quite unpleasant details followed too. Yes that's right. Too many cringe - moments arose from it I'm dumbfounded. Scared, they flee and not too long that one - light SUV appears behind them. Keeping it still will help. < br / > < br / > As for being disturbing I guess that depends.",0
The whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is out of the question. MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS... < br / > < br / > Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word.... Amateurish. Do not judge this by the poster.... you'll be very let down.,0
Don't watch it.,0
The sound was so bad that I had to watch the entire film with the subtitles on. This really is taking toilet humour to another level! Lines like :'I don't feel too good...,0
Some of the best horrors have very simple story lines. The characters are undeveloped and viewer is hard - pressed to find anything to sympathize with them. Here it's merely annoying.,0
I can't believe this is on DVD. I find this funny.,0
And that's all they do. It's just plain bad.,0
I mean what was that all about! Urghh....... AVOID AT ALL COST!,0
It is truly atrocious.,0
"First, it takes a full half hour to get Hackman out of jail and to start doing the job. By time the real action gets going, I was so bored that I just wanted the movie to end. Again, another 20 minutes.",0
"and yes, whats with the Blair - Witch effect? I have said my peace. no budget? Do not waste your time watching this!",0
Many times throughout the movie I found myself laughing hysterically. I have to give it credit on its campiness though. < br / > < br / > I agree with other comments that sound is very bad.,0
I just didn't like it.,0
"In lack of anything better to compare it with, "" Blair witch style "".",0
"And I ( usually ) like horror - movies. It's one - and - a - half hour of torment. However all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever. But ( again, this too ) serves no end whatsoever. I've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se. I think this movie was supposed to be shocking.",0
Horror doesn't mean the movie has to be demented. I can't believe anyone liked this movie. There was nothing scary about this movie at all. A complete waste of my time and money.,0
"Ironically, Director Griffith appears as one of the black - faced extras at the "" Black and Tans "" ball. """,0
"If you're looking for a Bridget Jones, Notting Hill kind of experience you won't find it here.",0
"Hiya folks, < br / > < br / > Well, this movie sucks really. THANK YOU! < br / > < br / > Next time. Love is rare in this film. Think "" Love Actually "" in reverse.",0
So everyone in the cast dies and at the end you don't really care.,0
A.,0
And it works for that for that purpose : being a British romantic comedy it is a bit more. Both have ex post facto regrets. Watching TRUTH ABOUT LOVE ( is this a double entendre about the star? ) Sam in fact is spending time with a lover Katya ( Branka Katic ) and is indeed cheating on Alice.,0
"Dougray had a nice boat. < br / > < br / > Bad, Bad, Bad. < br / > < br / > Otherwise, bad. Plot = bad.",0
"In end, the'good guys'win,'bad guys'loose... You get the picture. But then the story line started becoming more and more unrealistic. A WASTE of a potentially interesting movie. Come on.",0
"The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much. I've seen better production quality on YouTube!",0
Not very engaging.,0

Couldn't they fiend a better script?,0
"At least Tom Hanks'character on "" Big "" had a job that made sense to a child. It showed her practicing that dance at the beginning. ). Why the F would we feel for this person? They are almost all movies that my wife made me watch. He / she made the main character unlikable.",0
"Wow, how awesome! This movie is horrible. There is nothing original.",0
Paintings and books are nice but they're a different mediums. Moby Dick is stunningly uninvolving. < br / > < br / > I don't share in the pleasure all these reviewers found. (! ) This esteemed production has it's fans. Starbuck is supposed to be a golden god. It's dramatically inert. A lot of grey hair here. It doesn't build.,0
I hated both.,0

"Writer - director Daniel Lee can't hold a candle to the likes of John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. At the end of "" Dragon Heat, "" all I could think of was why I bothered sitting through the whole thing. < br / > < br / > This has to be one of the most annoyingly - directed films I have ever seen. But was I ever disappointed.",0
"The action is terrible, corny, and sparse? What? Sammo Hung uses a stunt double?",0
"You will have better sexy time! Basically, lets do a kind of Legally Blond film, but do it in New York. This film induces shock. < br / > < br / > I believe some guy in some unnamed marketing department had an idea. Ahh this film had so much potential! One reviewer referred to Guantanamo and i definitely agree with him.",0
"; p I guess people who made this film will never read this comment. - "" Da "" is Russian, not norwegian. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country.",0
"The movie had its moments, but I'm glad I didn't spend $ 9. Unfortunately, a lot of the movie's dialog was very fake sounding and cheesy. 50 to see it in theater. I am a fan of Luke Wilson so I thought it had potential.",0
"Haha! Speaking about movie, I'd say it's dull absolutely boring. It could be better, really. It's shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running! Even if it has Jessica Simpson.",0
"She balances perfectly between vulnerable and whimsy. Misunderstandings with hilarious and sad consequences follow. Kudos to everyone involved in this, especially Jessica Simpson. ). Not this guy! However, this is one blonde who won't take it lying down! Katie then ends up venturing into the adventure that is New York. He really cannot be underestimated.",0
Great actors such as Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could also have managed so much more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing. This just suggests lazy scriptwriting.,0
"These aren't even characters, they're plot functions. Blazing saddles!",0
I would recommend avoiding one. It's one product placement after another.,0
!,0
"So, not horrible, but easy to skip. Your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress by any means, but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying. She is stranded, but has one friend ( Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I wish we saw more often in film ), who lets her stay.",0
"When will we stop seeing singers that obviously can't act keep trying to, I hope ends soon. Please for whatever reason DO NOT WATCH THIS! I see there is a comment that this is so bad it's good, but that frankly is too kind. 1 / 10 because you can't give a zero. Please whatever you do don't waste your time, but if you do, feel sorry for ACTUAL actors involved for wasting their time doing this bomb. He did "" Old School "" for crying out loud! And whoever did this film, I wouldn't put this on your resume.",0
"No. Scott Marshal? It's the Anti - Annie Hall. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? Some guy named John Cohen. Who wrote this? Okay, that's why she got the part. That's really the only reason I can think of. < br / > < br / > And who directed this? No doubt I would've walked out of the theater sooner.",0
"Maybe buy some acting lessons? "" This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. No, I love YOU more. "" < br / > < br / > Poor Luke Wilson.",0
"in this movie he is some soldier junk nothing more, the creators made Quasimodo's love to show around and they even canceled Frollo's love.. but Notre dame was frollo. 3 IMDb point.",0

Great wasted night stuff. ). What a shame that Alan Clarke has to be associated with this tripe.,0

"Let's see. Now "" Newhart "" being all a dream? Very "" creative "". At least as far as reality it portrays on screen. Roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan. Annoying was more like it.",0

"So, no new story lines here.",0
"David and Dana end up retracing their steps over and over again until a less than cathartic finale. It's common practice for a film about repression to be somewhat muted in style and tone. By time the fifth member of the family shows up sweating and sickly, the film has used up all the good graces of Scott's well - measured performance. < br / > < br / > Scott gives a fine performance in the role of David Hurst, a dentist married to another dentist ( Davis ).",0
"). ( One nice touch : we never see the opera - director's face. ) Well, * The Secret Lives of Dentists * will not upset your expectations : it's solidly made but essentially unimaginative, truthful but dull.",0
"You can always read book or make an omelette. Yes, there is. There may something poetically right in seeing dentists suffer.",0
Those hopes were soon dashed. It doesn't work for me at all. I tend to like character - driven films.,0
"What purpose does all kids vomiting serve? The motivations of the characters are missing : Why is she cheating on him? Avoid it. Why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this? The film doesn't say. Who knows. < br / > < br / > The problem is the plot. Who's she doing it with? He's a dentist, decent looking, good father. A root canal is more interesting.",0

"The horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first. The only real "" oy vey!

Who knows.,0
"What will happen? Not even Clay's overprotective mother seems to be able to check on his status. The only one interested in keeping updated is Samantha... Gosh! This is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller I've ever seen. There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled. Believing him to be unconscious, the villains speak freely. Ah... but here's what it's all about... the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money.",0
"So it's a low - budget "" film "" ( I used the quotes because it was shot in Hi - 8 video ). But this collection of video footage can boast of no plot, no real characters, and no momentum. OK.",0
You might want to puke by the end of film.,0
"Furthermore, it was unnecessary and added nothing to film. Yes, the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy. A very important thing to leave out. The 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought. Bob has been following Tim for four years and only now is he confronting him? < br / > < br / > There was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film.",0
"I give this film it's props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted. You have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show. Human nature. What did she THINK was going to happen? Even that was predictable, since she went through with shooting herself to no effect. ) Then what do you do? He isn't going to shoot himself at that point, so it's kind of anti - climatic.",0
"< br / > < br / > Then there's the boxer - stalker theme. Well, he may be correct, I suppose. I saw "" Shiner "" on DVD. These factors probably account for the film being seen at all. There is frontal and full nudity. It simply makes no sense. Thank goodness for that. They are marginally attractive. This is in LA, mind you.",0
"Tim is a boxer with some serious issues. Sadly, those moments are few and far between. When the tables are turned and hunter becomes hunted, the resulting in the film's only genuine emotional catharsis. It would have been better off as such. What an unfortunate mess is "" Shiner. "" Remarkably low self esteem is disguised by an almost cartoon like arrogance that he wears like armour plating. These are the two most poorly written characters offering almost nothing to the story. In particular the story centering on Bob and Tim.",0
"Confusing. Pretty good start as far as I'm concerned. It is admirable. This escalates into violence. As characters, they don't add much to the theme or plot. Most low budget flicks don't aspire to much. It just doesn't work. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. < br / > < br / > The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot.",0
Well thats about it. The guns are more quiet than a mute. This is by far the worst film I have seen in my entire life. I suppose it is because they are the only good parts of film.,0
Klaus is so much better. He is a good character actor but that's about it. His performance is muted and noteworthy.,0
"I didn't get anything! I really hated this movie! There are a lot of parts that are laughably bad, too. Or, the police arriving at scene roughly fifteen times.",0
Then I would pay to see. Not even the guy with the champagne bottle of LSD can save this litany of worthlessness. Maybe they just shouldn't co - star in movies. Awful. How the hell did they get this made?!,0

"This wee tale by the Brothers Crook is like an old record with a skip in it. A trip to Romania would have wiped out the budget for sure. As an American I understand the difficulties Ind film artists have to face. Filmed in Mariette OH. Also, there is an appearance by co - director Jeff as he is in all his films. I finally decided to throw in my no cents worth. After reading all of the rave reviews about this film and a few that give it a so - so. Just like Alfred Hitchcock, eh?",0
Fox were wasted. Too bad this film was a wasted opportunity. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life.,0
"But the rest was crap. He doesn't know what he wants, or what he is. The title should have been the walker.",0
That was only he did walk. I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie. I got worse.,0

Why???!!! !,0
And that about sums up.,0
"All you hear is Julio Chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole film. ), slow to the point of driving you crazy.",0
"This movie is pure trash! The child is also lusted after by other leering men. But if you're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western, forget it. It's revolting.",0
"It just isn't there. Unfortunately, this was their only film together. Too bad, but, given the story, I doubt anything more could be made of this. Couldn t Henry be in EASY RIDER for example?",0
"Peter Fonda is bad because, well, because he's bad. Not that anyone else is good. The editing and direction are worse than pedestrian. But they say them so badly!",0
Action sequences defy belief. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the Grand Canyon. That it manages to do just fine.,0
Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. Man oh man!,0
"A lot of energy and that's all. And, shortly after this, he backs into a post on which the number 5 was just freshly painted.

"David who's a firm believer in gun - control uses knives high explosives and Molotov cocktails, as well as his fists, to take out the entire Tony crew. This CD has given David an edge over the international mobsters who are after him.",0

"Your supposed to be laughing at it!! i mean seriously... what? < br / > < br / > "" But its a comedy "" some of you might be screaming. What ever you do steer clear of little man. Thats true but thats no excuse for such a dumb plot. Probably not.",0

I was surprised by how low the humor was in this film.,0
They see midgets being just like babies. So was the directing. That is its lame excuse for showing something like that. Don't watch this film.,0

"Little Man is so bad that there's a Rob Schneider cameo. First, I'm impressed with the special effects. How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it's not a baby? It's too easy. He's got a full set of teeth!!! Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel.",0
I'm not surprised. It just got tired fast. The story is pretty lame. Say those two lines over and over for 1. I really felt ripped off after seeing this.,0
Or not. Comes this heartwarming tale of hope. Do you like fart jokes? Do you drool? I was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already though. < br / > < br / > The movie summary is pretty basic.,0

"John Carradine in small part mainly lurks about. Even with warnings by the caretaker, the director pays no attention to the supposedly cursed house. Nor is it fun. Just like the inspired opening, the ending is deliciously downbeat. < br / > < br / > Boring, confusing and tacky all rolled up into one, equals this penniless midnight horror production. Performances from a recognizable b - cast is mainly rigid. But laziness did set it early. However I found "" Seven Corpses "" to be inferior.

"This is the type of movie where it actually hurts to acknowledge that it really, really sucks. I normally sanctify stuff like this! The last seven owners were mysteriously murdered here and the credits montage gleefully exhibits their final moments. The film - within - film structure is what mainly causes "" House of Seven Corpses "" to be so boring and uneventful.",0
Faith Domergue is Ireland's aging star and Carole Wells is the young ingenue. I won't waste any more gray matter on it.,0
Ostensibly this is a Z - grade DTV horror film.,0
"We already know that their movie isn't "" real "". Far too much time is spent on the movie within a movie. My two favorite are the beginning and ending. These scares just don't work. Can you say BORING? The acting is atrocious. The score is terrible.",0

( At least there's truth in advertising. ) Schlocky'70s horror films... ya gotta love'em.,0
I am a huge Stooges fan but the one and only redeeming quality this movie has is that Curley is in it.,0
I think not. 00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb. The crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat. Ms. Xavier appears to be a very attractive female. At least all I lost was $ 3.,0

Awful musical numbers don't help any either.,0
"Vernon Dent appears early on in an uncredited role. Having just seen this on TMC, it's fresh in my mind. By the way, this is obviously after Curley's first stroke, and his reduced energy level is clear. It's obvious that while the stooges are featured stars, they don't really run the show.",0
The talking horse is also underutilized.,0
"Spade Cooley has a couple of numbers. If you are a Stooge fan, then stick with shorts.",0
"And so it is here. < br / > < br / > Point two is the cinematic style. That would be the approach of Woody Allen's "" Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex "", and, arguably, this film. You can dumb it down - the film of "" Slaughterhouse Five "" is to my mind an example of that.",0

On another note, it's too bad there isn't anything in here explaining how Tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place. People are surprised when a sequel is actually better. It's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film.",0

"I too had to fast forward through most of this movie. The picture quality is grainy all the way through. And what little plot there is, is just plain stupid.",0
"There was absolutely no depth to her character, nor any of the other female leads. Hudson's Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. This movie is all flash and no soul.",0
We expected something great when we went to see this bomb. A complete waist of time and money. It is basically a Broadway play put on film. The music is plain terrible.,0

"Beyonce Knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well, but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz. There are lots of songs ( perhaps too many? Anika Noni Rose as the third member of the Dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film. First, the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor. For me, Effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie.",0
Yeah. < br / > < br / > Nothing original here. < br / > < br / > Beyonce's involvement makes this hypocritic garbage.,0
"My oh My, what a nightmare. It's at # 58!",0
"A bunch of songs does not movie make. Eddie Murphy looks just ridiculous. Yet, this film is overrated and overblown. I can't even believe that Condon is being set up to be nominated for a Directing Oscar when all he did was put together an album.",0
I waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent. Her performance wasn't strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in film. I was definitely disappointed by the finished product. WRONG! You cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life.,0
Yes there are great performances here. During the first 45 - 60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance. When he started channeling Stevie Wonder I couldn't help laughing out loud.,0
"It really portrayed the black music scene back then. I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while... what with all it's raving reviews, nominations and media attention. The singing just kept coming, one after the other.",0
"Wow. < br / > < br / > All in all, stay away from this film. I won't even explain the ending, because quite frankly I can't make it out myself. That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining. I got it because I love bad movies I love Michael Madsen.",0

"But Hollywood also has its eye toward making money. Hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film.

Sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide. Then it's over. The film changes tone and becomes a crime - drama in its final portions.",0
"Supposedly this is due to his own depression but the script doesn't support that. < br / > < br / > It is typical of Ventura Pons to put forth crass psychologically handicapped characters. However, this faux sociological analysis is a big step down from CARICIAS or Caresses, where the characters maltreat and despise each other for well founded reasons that play out during that film.

Even though I watched the whole thing I wasn't made to care even for a moment about either of them.",0
"The other type of films show the viewer with a lot of gratuitous sex because the'creators'don't have anything interest to say.

When Bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun, pandemonium ensues. < br / > < br / > This is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio.",0
One solid acting turn appears among this slag : Stan Abe as a zealous FBI agent. Direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic post - production editing and sound reproduction. The mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movie's end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario.,0
"Unfortunately, of the post - 1940 films, this might just be one of their better ones.",0
Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop? This movie was long and boring.,0
"Obviously, there was no script to speak off. The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life. She obviously suffers from something, but why do we in the audience have to suffer as well? We barely know anything about her background or her motivations. A perfect cure for insomnia. Normally I try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making.",0

"Instead we get an exploration of the alien's habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag. In addition, the script does not focus on the hero and heroine, and goes off kilter in several places. Slither is a horror comedy that doesn't really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other. In the final analysis this movie's problems are in the script - it isn't that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates.",0

There's no gore. It's all silly and pointless. The alligator is rather silly creation. All the same to me. I suspect it's stock footage.,0
"But remember it may not be engaging at a few points. Acting is below par though, but who was expecting it to be better, eh? It also has lots of good jungle scenery. But natives are believable, if not authentic. And like a lot of creature movies, this one ends with an extremely high body count.",0

"Five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before. I'd give it 1, but the soundtrack is OK so 2 / 10. It is BOILER ROOM. It is THE FIRM.",0
The all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good. I wouldn't be rushing out to employ him in the future. The anticipation on the way home was far better than the film. For a start the direction is appalling. Secondly the lead role is completely miscast as Ryan Phillipe.,0

Also, I would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist would focus himself on lethally punishing the naughty children! THAT would have made "" Christmas Evil "" a classic, whereas now it's just forgettable and pitiable piece of junk.",0

In case you're exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nudity... this is your film. which is pretty pathetic and pointless. Her arch - enemy is played by a seemly fatigue Christopher Lee.

A husband murders his rich wife for her money. Many minutes pass in quietness, no one speaks, and few act. It is a shame the MST3K guys never got hold of this movie.",0
Perhaps the late - night TV telemarketers are missing a major opportunity in nothilling it as such.,0
The acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type ; the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving. i. e. one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years. The dialogue is leaden. Unfortunately this isn't quite accurate. The film plays out rather like a film school graduate's attempt to emulate these masters. Various reviews I have read compared this movie to the likes of those by Wong Kar Wai or Hou Hsiao - hsien.,0
"I see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry. But don't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late'40s.

Extremely overrated.,0

Only Celia Johnson manages to do the character of the Nurse some justice. This Tybalt is so mean - looking that we don't believe the characters'pity after his demise.,0
"And there you have your 120 minutes! It really doesn't stay focused on the New York magic. This was a movie i could not wait to see! I know that it is a remake, but it is not a french style remake!",0

I only wish that i could give this movie a rating of zero. < br / > < br / > Romeo, Romeo, whyfore art thou not dead yet, Romeo? Benvolio was unfeeling and mercilessly choppy with his lines.

"Other than that I'd only recommend it to Hollywood muscial completist. Maybe it wasn't such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left Brigadoon, maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump.

"Why is the movie itself such a stupid bore? < br / > < br / > What happened along the way? Gene Kelly and Vincente Minnelli, the team behind "" An American in Paris "", are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations.

I saw Brigadoon on TV last night ( 12 Sept 2009 ). The accents were shameful.,0
"And who the heck decided to cut all of Meg's songs out of the movie? ! But when I saw this, I was like, what the heck?!

Who decided to do all of that?!",0
Can fake scenery ruin a picture? Part of it also was the dancing. But a lot of that hokey business has to do with action scenes. Musicals did very well in the'50s. No.,0

If it's all the same to you the reader though I feel compelled to point out that with the lone exception of Christopher Walken in a returning role as Gabriel this movie is pathetically HORRID. One gets the feeling we wander aimlessly from scene to scene just to move the film along to Walken's next big line. < br / > < br / > What's wrong with this movie? If you buy it, return it.",0
2! Go see Nr.,0
"The Prophecy II "" is nevertheless the weakest of the three "" Prophecy "" films with Walken. Still, Walken's performance isn't only redeeming quality of the film. The character of Valerie was annoying enough, and Danayel annoyed me even more. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal Angels is brought to earth. I personally liked "" The Prophecy "" of 1995 a lot.",0
Co The purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse Valerie Rosales ( Jennifer Beals ) from getting born. The movie begins with Gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing War of Heaven here on earth.,0

It was a 90 minute Western just like the ABC program was.,0
This movie is lame and not funny at all. The plot doesn't even make sense. I didn't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal. Who are these people what are they doing?,0

"Ray McInally's performance was great, which is one of the few plus points. Conceit 4 : That severing all ties with the US and NATO is a good thing. It needs the viewer to buy into a series of conceits. This is crude, simplistic student politics made into drama. ... thankfully he hasn't, yet!",0

But the script gives her no option but to chew the scenery.,0
Why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths? One is Nat Moyer who is Yiddish communist while the other is Midge Carter a former golden gloves champion who ` s also black. Two old men sitting on a park bench.,0

For me the main problem's the uneven script. Not even'classic'film clips did much.,0
"The casting of Mae West was one of the worst casting choices in movie history. As one reviewer here said, her role had nothing to do with the movie or book. It was an awful movie.",0
An absolute disaster. It's not good at all but I was never bored. gets a sex change from a doctor ( John Carradine - - dead drunk ) and comes out as Myra ( Raquel Welch ). ! Welch is actually not bad as Myra but her lines make no sense so you never know what to make of her. Myron Breckinridge ( Rex Reed!!! ),0
"And, partly because of this, she seems to be in a different movie. Nevertheless, that tagline just about sums it up. THAT'S certainly a strange way to promote a film upon which a great deal rested. John Carradine and Jim Backus, as Doctors, also amble in briefly.",0
Best performance =?.,0
"But romance is amazing, deep, sometimes complex. My dissatisfaction is split : 30 % tone - deafness, 70 % lackluster writing. All characters, white plus a few token minorities, are one - dimensional, cardboard cutouts of people concepts. That's fine. ( I'll indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin. ) < br / > < br / > The 30 % : I agree with the first commenter's synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories. < br / > < br / > The 70 % is why everything falls short.",0
"Breckinridge is a touchstone of another, equally important vein. They weren't inspiration, they were desperation. That's how Michael Sarne, director of this colossal flop, was able to get the job. It was the Sixties, and anyone with long hair and a hip, distant attitude could get money to make a movie.",0
"< br / > < br / > Perhaps Sarne is not the only one to blame, however, as film's screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief. Also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the Fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals. The X - rated movie about sex change operations and Hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of it's release.",0
"Upon seeing it, I think I have my answers. Throw in some old film footage of old stars, and the movie becomes even more disconnected. I don't mean to put this cast down personally ; but in this film, no one comes out looking good. Bravo for debut performances! Rex Reed bounces around as Myron, Myra's alter ego, and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene. But, of course, arguably the most notorious role went to Mae west.",0
"When it was finally released there wasn't the usual three ring circus of publicity. Oops. It's the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed. < br / > < br / > This was one of the "" youth "" pictures that nearly bankrupted Hollywood in the 1970's. That's why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then vanish.",0
My vote is three. However the non - sense story is awful and hard to be described.,0
"Rewrite upon rewrite followed. Everything runs off in multiple directions, nothing connects, and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had. The cast, sensing disaster, became increasingly combative. < br / > < br / > Gore Vidal's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement. < br / > < br / > The accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself.",0
MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is just plain mean. This film was loathed from day one. Its intentions aren't honorable.,0
"Let's hope ten was lucky number and they don't do another one, I'm not sure my ribs could take it. The worst thing about the movie is the actors. He looked more like a public school boy in fact.",0
I still can't believe how bad this movie was.,0
"The dire cut scenes. This movie is as bad as bad films get. the bad script, bad acting, bad effects, bad locations, bad stunts bad everything. The other actors on screen could barely deliver their lines.",0
"Just forget about it! What a disappointing movie! The sound mixing is horrible, because sometimes the voices are disconnected.",0
"She possesses the Eye of Destiny, good in her hands, dangerous if anyone else got it. < br / > < br / > Bureau 17 has caught a Satanist from California, Hyde ( no relation to Dr. Jekyll ). Cinematography isn't great either. < br / > < br / > As usual, there are a number of sex scenes.",0
And Eileen Daly is just a lower rate Elvira. Ed Wood is eclipsed and becomes Orson Welles.,0
"I wouldn't be surprised if the script was off - camera as they were performing. You can take that figuratively or literally. Everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page. Did Merchant Ivory put a hold on their casting calls? This movie has quite a few bad ones. I can't exactly say I was ripped off. 50 ). Usually, I think people are too hard on directors and actors. Not a single effort was put into making this movie - - let's just sum it up like that.",0
"But hey, stunt men deserve their moment of glory always. Albert Rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career.",0
"I saw this movie last year in Media class and I have to say I really hated it. I'm sorry to everyone who loved his work, but I unfortunately did not.",0
The book was great. Wait a second...,0
Well that is all. I think that the shots and lighting were very poor.,0
"The book is fantastic, this film is not.",0
It seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling story.,0
"A few weeks ago, I read the classic George Orwell novel, 1984. So when I rented the DVD, I was intrigued to see how this adaptation measured up. - Brian O. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen.",0

< br / > < br / > I knew about the movie and could not wait to see it. I enjoyed every page. Especially as a book adopter.,0
I am a massive fan of the book and Orwell is certainly my favourite writer ever since studying Animal Farm at GCSE. However this is also where the movie is let down.,0
what does he do? where does he work? The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making. I accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it's very annoying all same.,0
"There was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book, and that is morphing characters. he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances at people without immense fear. In the book Winston knew that this was a huge risk to wander around there and was skeptical and frightened at every trip. The terrifying thing about Big Brother is that, in a way, it has some points behind its philosophy. I think it was the latter.",0
Orwell's dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places our modern world. I strongly recommend that you read the book.,0
"It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes.",0
"A much lesser follow - up. The script is terrible, acting mediocre at best, and the direction unimpressive.",0
"Sure, most of these places are hardly likely to produce a cube like this any time soon, but that's beside the point. Does it get any dumber than this? in anti - military movies? Amazing. But this time the story has been lowered to the level of the dialog, too. The utterly moronic plot so obviously stems from the pen of a frustrated left - winger. The stupidity in this movie would shame even Ed Wood, De Palma, and Woo. Anyone who has any idea at all about human nature will see right through this idiocy.",0
"And later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped. Well I thought wrong. I wasn't really fond of the first "" Cube "" movie. All of which are left entirely to the viewer. With some incredibly corny lines, perhaps screenwriter got bored and didn't care.",0
"This movie is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come.",0
"Granted, these characters are amusing. In short, Cinderella is a very bland character. You go girlfriend! Freedom from her servant role?",0
but cube zero in comparison to it's predecessors really isn't worth sh * t! cube wasn't great but it was original and that made up for some technical flaws! ! oh and i hope this movie crashes and burns!!!!!!,0
"Unless you count "" Manos - Hand of Fate "" one of top ten movies EVER! This movie was yet another waste of time... Why oh why do I keep renting crap like this?... someone please tell me... * sigh * Oh well.",0
"Horrible. The killings in this movie isn't that bad, but for sure the movie is.",0
"I also fell pretty confident in saying that there's no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the foreseeable future. They have brought back the traps from Cube 1, though, ( by that I mean that they're almost the same ones, which is a bit of a shame ). This one is a bit different though.",0
"The story hardly gets a chance to develop because of superfluous dialogue and suffers from that. < br / > < br / > If this was a stand - alone b - movie, I'd probably give it about a four.",0
"< br / > < br / > What works? The acting is purely amateur hour, the pacing is slow ( how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen? film in the Cube series is part retread ( most of the booby traps are sadly recycled ), part aberration. And it stands perfectly well, on its own, without a stupid sequel like "" Cube Zero. "" Basically nothing.",0
First one was great.,0
"The acting is so - so. Nevertheless there isn't a single original thing in this movie. Things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something gruesome to happen. This script is sooo pointless. Duh. First of all, what about if you haven't seen the first one, this doesn't make any sense you nitwit director.",0
"Really there is nothing much else to say about it. The plot doesn't offer any new excitements, it even starts the same as cube I.",0
Shocking! This film is awful.,0
"Some of the ideas were kind of cool, but in the context of the original movie, both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. Still, for being fairly entertaining, I rated it a 5 out of 10. The first Cube movie was an art movie. That's just flippin'stupid.",0
"The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original, attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing. It's not that the story does not have potential ; it's simply that the first Cube film never needed to be expanded on. It was also nicely self - contained.",0

The script was really bad. The scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by Macarthur's words and gives him a smart salute.

This film was terrible.,0
To bad the plot was atrocious. Ritter wasn't bad either.,0
The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in Clockwork! This movie was terrible. Trust me. A blind director.,0
And did I mention the singing? This is only the second time I stopped a video / DVD part way through. I don't recommend it to anyone.,0
Bless. Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance. Everyone else is okay.,0
"I got lured by the title... Just like initial attempt happened rather out of the blue. And the laughingly bad attempt at giving some sort of poetic edge to a lower - class man makes things even worse. The leading character doesn't evolve at all, and the feeble attempt of changing fails without a good explanation.",0
Maybe Jobbo felt that the basic story needed a lit bit of support.,0
Either she was poorly served by cinema or she had no talent at all. What was she really like. She was being paid $ 500000 for this! So i have only two conclusion.,0
and ONE MAN ALONE ). Even her dancing is cloutish.,0
Please write in English only. < br / > < br / > Don't waist your time into this movie.,0
Who is who? Otherwise the film is very accurate in costume and scenery.,0
"He lives his first 20 years in a Christian village. < br / > < br / > Why do I write that? No one of the other male main characters, which are Christians, seems to breed a child. This film is probably pro - Muslimization. The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother.",0
"He'll survive. < br / > < br / > From the first, BU is just a chase film. He punches. Yawn. It doesn't have any emotional resonance when it comes. Oh, dear, the more I think about this film the more I hate it! He runs. He jumps. So what?",0
Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. < br / > < br / > Another film that makes no sense. But it was not for education and health. Everything else is very bad.,0
I think the SCI - FI channel could of done better than this piece of crap. it was not scary at all! One out of 10 max.,0
The answer was clearly NO! The plot sounded like it had promise.,0
"And to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient?! Didn't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or CGI?!? Especially this last bit is ridiculous. ! And why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans, and make the victim look like a freak? ( a volunteering soldier maybe?? It doesn't really matter, either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts.",0
"The script can't make Brilliant, right? Well, no not really since Aaron starts to go mad as he sees random images of Wolves & starts to develop a lust for blood. I mean Aaron is given back the gift of sight yet Hewitt is the villain?",0
Talk about a sour cow!,0
"< br / > < br / > Here's two ridiculous scenes. Way too long even at 90 minutes, boring, and devoid of ideas. ). RUN OUT OF THE DAMN LAB! They make love while music heavy on drums and Indian chanting is heard - crazy, man! A grouchy "" medicine man "" who spouts platitudes seems to do little, except for adding atmosphere. Crazy. The love making takes place immediately after a gruesome murder - who edited this turkey?!",0
"But as it turns out during a plot twist it ` s the mother who ` s the dummy. Is this character development or poor scripting? If only our own childhoods were so innocent, ah well as Orwell said "" Ignorance is strength "". I know what one my money ` s on.",0
"The plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very clever. Although i had heard this film was a little dry, I watch whatever Scott Bakula is in.",0
? 3!!!!!!???? Why is it that this movie is getting an 8. What performance? I don't understand people. What suspense?? < br / > < br / > This movie has no plot.,0
"Like another commenter on the film, I saw this in childhood. See it if you have the opportunity.",0
"Bafflingly, although The Creeper is fully aware of how Grey looks ( thanks to her aforementioned haunting of Kosleck ' who, conveniently enough, is engaged to a rival art critic ( Virginia Grey ) of Napier's! What we have here, in fact, is a penniless sculptor ( Martin Kosleck ) whom we even see sharing his measly plate of cheese with his pet cat! so as to gauge how violent his reaction is going to be!",0
Somehow our hero's work is reviewed side by side with the villan's absurdist sculpture. Overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements.,0
"< br / > < br / > The story line is nothing to write home about, and many scenes are dull. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as the Creeper. It's worth seeing once, anyway, for those who enjoy Forties horror movies.",0
The film is at its most feeble when showing ayurvedic practice America.,0
but this American version should be renamed and never be shown again. burn the movie and save the kids.,0
"Tami Erin is cute, but overacts.",0
"It does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but it NEVER captures the magic that is Astrid Lindgren's creation.",0
"5 ) Directing? This was not a good movie, it was a dreadful movie. - What plot? 1 ) Plot? That's the plot. - Hmmm. 4 ) Editing?",0
"Like the vagabond, the film wanders aimlessly and rather pointlessly.",0
She's just useless.,0
VERY BAD MOVIE........ and I mean VERY BAD...,0
But don't be fooled. She will not be remembered for this weird little story about a a hood's girl who finds that her past will always be with her.,0
"A similar theme would be far more effectively handled two years later in Altman's The Long Goodbye. But "" 1940s detective as fish - out - of - water in 1970s L. A. "" If you haven't seen those, don't waste your time with this! That oughta tell you enough right there.",0
"'Of course, his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in'The Wild Bunch '. I first saw Mr. Oates back in the 1960's television series called Stoney Burke.",0
"The sense of suspense is entirely absent. The cinematography is pedestrian. I saw this film when it was first released. But the death of this film is attributable to its terrible screenplay. The main characters settle on playing dry, emotionless types in a fashion that inspires no empathy whatsoever.",0
"Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold, nice location shooting, but it fails to come to any kind of a boil.",0
"According to IMDb, as well as to every other website that holds a review ; this "" thing "" doesn't have a director. Really, a LOT of dildo - action. The friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but she has her throat slit even the same night.",0
"It's night but light is streaming through the windows. That doesn't seem like a thing the Winchester boys would do. This one dropped a second body. Flashlights go out in an unlighted asylum, at night, and we can still see everything. A ghost that died in 1960's is making cell phones calls? Come on! Always stay together and watch each others backs!",0
"As a curiosity item, just fair.",0
Plot? He's the only one.,0
"I mean, most of it is stock footage! What were they smoking? See Captain Marvel instead. ). This dull thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoyed Annie Wilkes ( from Misery ). Prepare to see sunniest Moon ever! Oh, man, how low serials had fallen as by 1952!",0
"Something made in 1952, this bad, deserves a 2. It's basically Cody ( the lone world's salvation?",0
The acting is only so - so.,0
except for the guy who plays the ruler of the Moon Men. He is incredibly miscast. They don't even have locks on the front doors. Time has not been kind to it. < br / > < br / > What really irritates me is writing and the plotting.,0
"The rest is padding. World War I breaks out, the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle, yet enlist in the navy anyways. ... at least during its first half. She has an important role, but it's a small one. Also, don't watch this film just because Ginger Rogers is in it.",0
"With the outbreak of World War I, the threesome enlist and pursue Ginger from afar. For fans of stars only.",0
I'd like more background. And really corny. I would rather of just seen the ex - stars do commentary. But they tried to do too much. < br / > < br / > Very disappointing. The batmobile side story was stupid. That was it on those 2.,0
"< br / > < br / > As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. And there was a lot of that, believe me. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. A woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town, and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo, both zombie related. Jerky camera - work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date!",0
"I guess they ran out of time, or videope.",0
That's it's only selling point! Complete and utter rubbish in every considerable way. They're stalked by a serial killer who was burned years before.,0
"Anyone interested in Australian cinema, please, for the love of God, pretend this film was NEVER made. It often looks as though it is a home movie, but even home movie has'realism '. Why was this film made?",0
It is a complete waste of your time.,0
"Lead role Alan Dale used to star in television soap opera Neighbours, but ended up in The X Files - how did THAT happen?",0
"As for the plot, well, thats even MORE stupid! Some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Houseboat Horror is a great title for this film. '), while the actual song to It's worth watching * because * it's bloody awful. < br / > < br / > But in the end, this only makes what you do get so ridiculous and amusing.",0
"4 out of 10. At least it's better than Swedish "" The Bleeder "".",0
"Ever hear Mel Blanc's son? Okay, so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted backrounds. < br / > < br / > The animation is clunky. Dr. Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi.",0
He was terrible! I liked this show! Spider Wars 3.,0
"< br / > < br / > TIDBIT yes, it's THAT Savannah. < br / > < br / > "" C'mon, "" I can hear you say - "" this is just girls gettin'naked! ). Who needs a story??! """,0
"So maybe it is a question of fashion. No matter what? Germans are they "" in "" again?",0
"The film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark. No, that made it all seem invisible. That will make it all seem intimate! "" In contrast with them, I had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. Yeah, we get it, the life of the lonely old man was boring - - but we figured that one out at the very beginning. I can assure you that this film won't win anything in the festival where I saw it. The actors in this film, though, had only one facial expression each. But when film shuddered on, instead, there were moans coming from the audience.",0
Stillness is good. What was the point of it all? But this film though was just plain slow.,0
I wholeheartedly disagree with the other viewers of this wretched film. Alice Faye comes off quite hollow. Ditto for J. Carrol Naish who actually appears uncomfortable in his role. < br / > < br / > This is a chica chica boom bomb of film. The beginning and end are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancing.,0
"Warnicki is a sympathetic, if flawed, man. By contrast, Sgt. There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous.",0
That would certainly get my suspicions aroused. Guggenheim did mostly documentaries and Stix didn't do much of anything. < br / > < br / > This film may go down as the worst ever done by Steve McQueen. Steve McQueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there.,0
"One of the sisters finds that out the hard way. So we KNOW he's in the house. Margot Kidder as the annoying, overtly aggressive alcoholic Barb. And it's a total snore. Then one day, out of the blue, it finally arrives!...",0
It doesn't work at all. You almost get impression Connery plays three roles rather than one. This is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re - naming. You can also see that in the very unsteady character development. Firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong.,0
"It makes Never say Never again look like genius. Connery's presence drove me to buy it, and it's not good. funny.",0
This movie is just plain bad.,0
"Stella Stevens plays the villainess this time ; she's good, but can't match Shelley Winters in predecessor.",0
I first thought my DVD players was messed up. It wasn't.,0
Amazing that this film was even released!,0
"Sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from Giant Country, and fears that he will eat her. Sophie and the BFG become great friends, and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants.",0
This was not enjoyable to watch. And sad.,0
Did anyone edit this film? < br / > < br / > I'd recommend avoiding this movie.,0
The twist ending silly and predictable.,0
"This gets very annoying as the movie progresses. When I rented "" Unhinged "", I was expecting a gore movie. The others acting is bad, but not nearly as bad as hers. Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique. Many shots are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling.",0
"I normally don't take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies few will see. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. What happens? I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. Save your money and your time. The grand total of three times that this occurs is off - screen.",0
"Where the movie really falters in entertaining is the writing, lighting, and the editing. They provide a horribly tacky cheap entertainment. The reason I didn't see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense. Then cuts back in. I'll start by saying I'm a huge fan of cheesy horror flicks. moments. This is the plus side to the movie. Then it got boring.",0
"I like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy - - more than the next guy, actually - - but this was way beyond cheesy and more into rancid. Saw this late one night on cable.",0
It's a great laugh. Though it was inexpensive ( $ 6.,0
YAWN. YAWN < br / > < br / > The ending... dude!,0
"The mother and daughter are better, but not much. The killings are gruesome, but nothing we haven't seen before.",0
"For some reason, though, this house has no roads going to it. We wish that someone would kill us just to end our suffering. I'm not sure where that came from ). If you want to see all the good parts of the movie just look on the back of the box. I bought Unhinged because I got suckered by the gory picture on the cover.",0
"But be warnedit is really, really bad. One by one they fall victim to an unseen assailant. Banned as a'Video Nasty'in the UK, Unhinged has naturally gained quite a bit of notoriety. Only a couple of bloody scenes towards end and a bit of gratuitous nudity save Unhinged from getting the lowest possible score.",0
"Soon, one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again ; another, still bed - ridden, is quickly disposed of ( after being forgotten for most of the duration ). The film turned out be a dull, amateurish and ugly - looking ride ; the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible half of the time, whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept!",0
"I felt sorry for it. Eighties eyeshadow assaults the viewer. Some of the most awkward, badly lit, overlong scenes are played out with the gusto of a Valium overdose. Pretty Young Girls In Peril. Otherwise pass. The scenes shift suddenly with long black - outs you could drive a Mack truck through.",0
"They are never ending! It's almost like having your teeth pulled, only not as much fun.",0
Ever watched a movie that lost the plot? Slide down and run like the rest of us? < br / > < br / > Where to begin? What do they do? Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe.,0
"Did he have a one seater? It's actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations. How come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay, rarely even checking up on each other? Then we've got twists like this film has. A two hour or less walk will kill them. < br / > < br / > Plot holes are abundant here. Maybe the answers are in the boring script. Why didn't they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town?",0
"Nope! Sounds like a resurrection of classic B - movies from the 50s, right? It's not an example of high camp fun, which is way, WAY off the mark. 44 % more in the first place.",0
"It must have left many wondering what the fuss was all about. It would have made a much better 30 minute - 1 hour TV episode on say, Tales from the Darkside. < br / > < br / > And then there's the twist ending. One of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs. By today's standard, Unhinged is a tame little fairy tale. Smart move.",0
but banned? this movie was banned in england?,0
"I tried to like this slasher, like I try to enjoy all slasher films. But Unhinged I think is an example of that formula going wrong. There's a fair amount of potential, but film delivers too little to be worthwhile.",0
"There's unnecessary shower scenes and exploitative gore. ). Anyway, it starts with a group of three attractive co - eds crashing their car on the way to a concert. How I came to viewing this then is simple : it promised gore and it was only $ 6. After hanging with Marion for awhile, Terry ( our "" hero "" ) and Nancy decide they must contact their parents.",0
Who cares it sucked anyway.,0
"This movie is NOT worth a "" free "" ticket viewing. ! < br / > < br / > Stick with the book. < br / > < br / > What a pity. < br / > < br / > Do NOT take kids to see this movie.",0
I know small kids who hated this movie. I HATED IT! See GOOD movie!,0
I couldn't enjoy the film at all.,0
"What is with that stupid fish! Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! The film sure does look tacky! Myers proves he can't act in this film. And another thing, fish.",0
"This is cheese filmmaking in every respect, but it does have its moments. Boring fodder.",0
So I finished it alone. AVOID THIS MOVIE.,0
< br / > < br / > I shudder I've seen some bad things in my time.,0
I hope this one does Dr Seuss some justice. But it turned out to be the the biggest let down. A far cry from the whimsical world of Dr Seuss.,0
"Holy cow, what a piece of sh * t this movie is. I guess they didn't know either!",0
"When my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, I know it is bad. < br / > < br / > I wanted to claw my eyes out.",0
"It was a complete piece Hollywood trash. F -, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1 - 10. For the MONEY! Well I should have went with my instincts. It's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. Was the Cat intended to be a middle aged Jewish woman?",0
"< br / > < br / > This film, in short is atrocious. The Cat came to try to let kids have some fun. Possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist.",0
"His Cat is painfully unfunny. He tries way to hard. Take Mike Myers, for example.",0
"But unfortunately they cant save this film. Was one written? Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying. The plot was messy, messy, messy! < br / > < br / > Poor Dr Seuss - the man was a genius!",0
A lame plot with dirty jokes. Bad.,0
"The script by Rifkin, sorry Coogan & Tony Markes is awful. As for the horror aspect that too is lame.",0
When I think of Cat in the hat. This movie has made me upset! I think short this means adult humor.,0
The acting and the story was just terrible. Bo Welch should be fired or writer should.,0
Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable. The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces. Whale Rider gets a PG - 13 but this movie gets a PG? Please.,0
The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor.,0
Essentially what happens here is a total twisting of Dr. Seuss's classic. It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money. Take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie.,0
( unless its directors family ) How on earth this movie got > 400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me. These guys should stick to making MTV videos. Greed greed and more greed.,0
"This movie is OVERBLOWN and way, way too long. How could Mike Myers need money?",0
"Not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now.",0
Go with the Grinch. I saw it for free at college.,0
Thank you.,0
"? And now he's making movies? Why is this show so popular? Why am I not laughing? The plots are dull. Oh, save us all!",0
"Film critics of the world, I apologize. With movies like "" Elf Period. Then the cat showed up. Not that the writers helped him out any. How wrong I was.",0
"The Cat in The Hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me. As I began watching I noticed something, this film was terrible. < br / > < br / > Avoid this like a leprous prostitute.",0
"Cat was... well, just awful. < br / > < br / > Call the SPCA. Why a New York Accent? Please, please, no sequel. So, what was the studio thinking? Can we talk? < br / > < br / > Why, why, why Mike Myers??",0
But not this.,0
But perhaps these days being ordinary is unconventional.,0
"< br / > < br / > I don't know, though. No major effort on the part of viewer required. And the "" emotion - light bulb connection "" seems gimmicky, too.",0
Her Father? His Butler? Who cares?,0
But I found that this Wrestlemania left a lot to be desired.,0
"Well, this could be the scenario if the world was inversed, but it's not. < br / > < br / > Yes it could. If there was some weird inversed Oscar Academy awards festival this flick would win it all. Whenever I saw that red - black so called monster on screen I couldn't hold my laugh back.",0
"I think "" Hellbored "" would have been a better title for this.",0
Actual kids in that era did not act or behave anything close to as bright - eyed and normal as these kids did.,0
In one word : sucky!,0
This horror movie becomes very funny considering the absurd of the plot. My vote is three.,0
"So, you - all take heart! Don't even waste your time, let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck! How it got made is beyond me.",0
"< br / > < br / > The main character, James is very believable - the story about an eager student starting to work is good in this setting. < br / > < br / > The film sets an unpleasant scene, this is also done fairly well. * The sound is at times very cheap. Also when the break comes, James is in a way hunted by the evil, and you feel some suspense until "" the fight "" is over. There are mysteries that are unveiled - in an acceptable way.",0
"< br / > < br / > Bottom line : See The Wicker Man instead. There may be spoilers here ; I don't care enough to filter them out. As - is, it merely seems amateurish. < br / > < br / > - Plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable. What's the background? What's supposed to make us care about anyone in this? Why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies?",0
"Depending on who you I wouldn't say there's anything scary here. It's one of those films which I would like to recommend but in all honesty I can't. I'm not sure if Hellborn was shot in a real insane asylum but if it wasn't they did a great job on the sets & the film looks pretty good overall. < br / > < br / > Director Jones does a good job, this is actually well lit & quite atmospheric film.",0
It makes me laugh that the DVD cover claims very proudly'from the special effects creator of Jeepers Creepers '.,0
"Cute huh? You'll be drunk 15 minutes into movie. I gave this 2 stars for only TWO reason. Turns out that there's a demon on the basement that's harvesting people's souls. There was still an hour to go. At this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid, I was begging for it to be over.",0
"On another hands the film probably could had been a fine or even classic B - movie, but here it is just a bad attempt at film - making. Matt Stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances. In an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every cliché of the genre. In theory, films should be a form of entertainment.",0
Burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me. You know those movies that are so bad they are funny? Not even.,0
It's exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures.,0
"One star for the acting. Watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about the three "" first times "" for a girl.",0
A corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film. I couldn't help but laugh throughout the film. Avoid this if you can.,0
The story just didn't ring true.,0
"This is a terrible film, and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion. Youth culture was never that desperate. Kay Lenz was 20 and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive. < br / > < br / > Ugh.",0
"Dated, blurry - romantic, and mostly unmemorable.",0
"Pleasingly spacey... Who was this chick? you have a strong stomach. Okay, try triple grandpa!",0
This could have been people discussing my grannys'diary. < br / > < br / > I love science & documentaries.,0
"I thought the movie was a poor documentary. Playing "" humble scientist "", are we? "" Nothing of substance was discussed. Politics of science were barely touched.",0
The 3 - D format is utterly wasted here. THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES < br / > < br / > Aspect ratio : 1.,0
The acting is plain awful except Michael Ironside. I don't get the story. This movie is really bad. She is awful. He said his lines like it too.,0
"Otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague. When "" Lisa & the Devil "" was shown at film festivals in the early 70's, it was a critical success. Leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes, while keeping some semblance of a story intact. He was right, and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down toilet. Audiences responded well to that gorgeous, Gothic horror film. Subtle, huh? No distributor would buy it. Worth seeing only for curiosity sake. He failed miserably.",0
I really love the opening stuff with Lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city.,0
"There are "" extras "" after the end credits ; deleted sex < br / > < br / > and gore scenes.",0
I guess that's where some of the cuts were made. There were no gorillas at all in the movie. < br / > < br / > Historicaly interesting.,0
He's the man in that lion cage. No wonder the thing got wrecked. But that's OK. I'm not going to criticize the movie. There's even a dirigible.,0
There is no plot. Beat that guy at end and win!,0
The plot was also pretty weak. It was very unrealistic. I was also really disappointed with ending.,0
"I can't say I've ever disliked an Asian film, quite the contrary. It was neither refreshing, nor breath of comedy. I caught this film on AZN on cable. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things.",0
Worse than Troma film.,0
I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7 : 40. They exaggerated the way love works in reality. The boyfriend was too stupid for his own age. All of the girls were stereo types. The beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches.,0
The night I rented it. Not even one. Oh boy!,0
I'd rather watch a traffic light change. Priceless even. It's a surreal moment.,0
"Going from one scene to next. OK, I have watched the original French version. This might be due to the uninspired dialog they were given. < br / > < br / > A perfect example of what I call an anti - movie. But I can't imagine this being better with subtitles. Not in an overacting obvious kind of way. None of which I could identify with or care for. The acting was pretty bad. There are almost no redeeming qualities to this film.",0
* * from * * * *,0
But what a disappointment. I awaited this movie with great interest.,0
The music in that sequence also is poor. MacLaine is the only real asset. Annoying talky with no real plot.,0
"Sinatra plays his "" cool "" shtick much too often in his movies, and it is rarely credible. Clichés. In real life, someone like Sinatra ( without the fame ) wouldn't get within 100 m of someone as beautiful as MacLaine. Even his pretty niece wants a piece of him! And, like Stacey Keach, Frankie - boy is anything but a good - looking woman's wet dream.",0
No yelling. Better to watch GREENCARD which has a similar plot and has charm and energy. The result : complete and total boredom. No vigor. * * * May contain spoilers.,0
"Also, the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really explored or explained. We don't feel these are real people, but cardboard cutouts acting in a marionette play. But on the whole I find the movie's interest to be purely that of a period piece of Hollywood history. What a major disappointment. The whole thing was phony with a capital'P '.",0
"Oh yeah, plot - - who cares? Yum!",0
"? And... ahh forget it, this film was stupid and made 1989! In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. Which is odd, in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant. So the seniors go about doing this. Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, this is just bad.",0
"Cloud. Its an interesting historical piece for us locals. The reason I like it is because I am from the area where this was filmed. I didn't know director was from St. The plot of this film is not strong at all, lots of holes.",0
"It's plain awful. Now, I know that the UK in recent years has put out incredible junk, but this is ridiculous ; the music makes Oasis seem like The Beatles. Whoever financed this £1000 joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners. It often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs. Ecclestone's I. Q. also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense.",0

"Probably dumbest ending of all time, but still... memorable. Also, if I recall, there's some pretty interesting pseudo - lesbian moments. It made quite an impression! I think I first saw parts of this film when I was about 10 years old when it was running on cable.",0
"From then on its a just - for - kicks assault on him. Oh, well. What appeals does it have except for sadism. Another hour and a half of my life. It's about a good person who makes a bad decision. That's all this movie is.",0

The film really doesn't have much plot, but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman, who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf. Werewolf Woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a'so bad it's good'film, but I completely disagree. Overall, I wouldn't even recommend this film to big exploitation fans.",0
Daniella has some issues brewing under her attractive exterior. She goes a bit feral when she beads horny men and slashes out their throats.,0
"Ms. Borel is, unfortunately, not a werewolf ; she is merely a very strong lunatic. But, as far as 1970s skin and blood flicks go, this one is hard to beat. The hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her legs.",0

Silly, simplistic, and short, GUN CRAZY ( VOLUME 1 : A WOMAN FROM NOWHERE ) goes nowhere. Confessing her true self as a bounty hunter, Saki takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of Johnny To and John Woo.",0

He is very dependent on the comedy going on around him. Stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent. Ben Stiller doesn't so much act as react. You don't root for the characters. And he does it very well.,0

Just terrible and mad shocking waste. The result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief. This astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians. Not even fun.,0
"The only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of stars. In fact, the whole film is just a talk fest, with much of the talk making no sense. Boy, this was one lousy movie!",0

"Wait, there's more! But director Vipul Shah and his writers are in no mood to do us any favours. It's the kind of film whose central conflict could be instantly resolved if the characters concerned simply sat down and had a chat.

Arjun decides to sabotage Manu when the latter's popularity threatens to outshine his own.",0

"Let's not even talk about most self - conscious actress on screen today, Asin. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief because I felt that the casting of Salman and Ajay was just ill - conceived. And to top all of that, the film just boringly dragged on. Who were they kidding with this? There's nothing special about it at all, trust me you will predict every clichéd thing that is going to happen in it.",0

Ajay Devgan as a Rock Star.. that is a dream in itself. It seems all the good directors are falling prey to the Box Office mania.. that the Mumbai Media Morons have created. He is good to the Indian Cinema as Titanic was to the Winter Cruise Business. Salman Khan's over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch. The story is a crap. I remember seeing some good movies from this Producer Vipul Shah but this is not one of them.,0

Later, after Mabel comes in the house, Mabel's father has a huge outburst at Nick, screaming at the top of his lungs about not wanting to eat spaghetti.",0
"Her parents don'thing in her life for her. He is always yelling at her when he is home telling her how to live her life and to stop acting like an imbecile. In A Woman Under the Influence Mabel goes crazy, but I can see why she does go crazy. Nick's mom is adamant about having Mabel committed.",0
"The acting is horrible, dull long - winded dribble. Pathetic. This movie offers NOTHING to anyone.",0
"< br / > < br / > The movie should be 1 / 3 the time, they just dragged the time to make a mini series.",0
Pity some of it didn't wash off on the others.,0
"Julius Caesar. "" Billy Zane is a laughably dense Marc Antony.",0
"Far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script. Then again, that might also be the reason why I disliked this film. There isn't an ounce of dignity in her. Why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and Octavia is never even seen?",0
"The slave chose to kill himself instead. He cried out for Cleopatra and was taken to her, bleeding. If you want history don't watch this movie. Mark Anthony never died of injuries obtained in battle as depicted.",0
"Hence, it's hard for me to review in depth this movie because because i didn't understand what was said. So, i found the second episode dull and their tragic fate isn't told powerfully. She is strong - willed but also a very supportive, tender soul mate. So, it is not really a documentary, nor a peplum but a great love story. They are so poor ( blue screens, ships, Sphinx ) that it'funny. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles.",0
They tried to make her appear a saint for God's sake! She gave birth while feeding her people!?!? The portrayal of Cleopatra reminded me a cheap soap opera.,0
turns away from him after seeing his wooden leg.,0
"His brother Derek is a rival for Ms. Bennett's affections. Necessarily ridiculous film version the literary classic "" Moby Dick "".",0
Thats where it got disturbing. Before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it. But if you choose to watch it just don't be unsuprised. Got past the rape scene and i couldn't figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie. Oh and as a note Rosario Dawson still did great job. There was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing!,0
Ben Draper are in for n big surprise. what a pathetic movie. He are completely unharmed. just for the supposed to be drunk man but all is not what it seems. < br / > < br / > But Sgt.,0
"Starbuck and Stubbs might as well be Smith and Jones. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a pure coincidence. Still I'm sure 1930 audiences shuddered. < br / > < br / > I'd see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else. That brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. < br / > < br / > John Barrymore is Ahab in an over the top performance. Of course this was all before the Code.",0
The value of this film is only collection and no artistic. In a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors. I rated it 4 / 10. The movie'Gung Ho!,0
Almost. The cast was better than this material. In the withdrawal several of Carlson's Marines ended up on another island and were abandoned! So was the audience.,0
There was school. Even the girls got into it. None for kids. There were toy guns. Here goes. Hooray! It had a purpose originally of being propaganda. Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz. How utterly boring. But quickly came to be kids movies.,0
"What makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring DVD has become the equivalent of the old late night double - bill circuit, the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like The Border. Unfortunately, he never really gets his hands dirty, barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface.",0
< br / > < br / > Neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner.,0
This was a waste of film.,0
"Almost. And really not a good one. so, we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn't be that bad. Don't waste your money. I honestly feel emotionally scarred. And don't let your kids watch it.",0
Terrible direction. One of the worst films ever. Sub - par with bad TV movies.,0
"My neighbor's vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie. If you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script, check out "" The Crew "".",0
I guess that would be funny in two of three instances.,0
But the story just seems to beggar belief.,0
"At one point the Mom is told her son died at a Clinic in Mexico. The Mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local Children's Play at a community theater. ). She gets caught, and then realizes it is not her child. Of course, she cannot swim and sinks like a rock. The lawyer saves her, but they miss a chance to run after the Dad. That alone would have gotten most people put into the Mental Ward or a few months in jail waiting for trial. On and on it goes, and where it stops nobody knows!",0
"Sadly, this isn't one of them. As the truth begins to unravel, Justin uncovers an unexpected secret. < br / > < br / > I have nothing against low - budget films. The horror! It would have been the film's potential saving grace. I just finished "" Dark Chamber "" aka "" Under Surveillance "" and I'm stunned.",0
"And where are these humorous laugh - out - loud moments? Clever, compelling, original, intense, clever, genius????!!? I witnessed none of those things.",0
I was so ready to enjoy this movie but I was ultimately disappointed. ).,0
Ealing made many great movies. This clearly is not one of them. Another British cinema flag waver.,0
And therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie.,0
Spoiler : Rosario Dawson turns the tables on her assailant. Is victim any better that theccuser? She in essence nullifies the judicial system. !,0
I went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that.,0
They should have been interviewed on their own. A Joe Strummer doc deserves better.,0
"First off, without titles, its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are. The movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour. Joe Strummer : The Future Is Unwritten is for diehards only.",0
"As I write this review in 2008, we are mired in a remake culture.",0
I don't know. It just doesn't work. al. I'm sure the man is turning in his grave.,0
"Did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot? Flat out, they didn't care. My gawd, who would find this funny.",0
"The TV Pilot for Black Bart stunk. : ) The plot was non - existent and the acting was not good. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces!!!",0
"Imagine the movie without the satire, humor, or writing skills.",0
"That show's called a'pilot '. Some don't, become nothing.",0
I'm not sure what they were thinking.,0
This movie was disgusting. What is garbage? Talia you are a sick demented loser.,0
"I love film noirs, but this one was a real disappointment. Peter Lorre has one thankless role as a suspect.",0
"Based on a Cornell Woolrich novel, and passable for single viewing.",0
"Frewer on the other hand is painful to watch. Wishbone would have made this movie a lot better. But sadly, there is no dog in this movie except for Frewer. After he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum, he thenneers as if that were some kind of British trait.",0
"Not so, as this film is very'of its age ', in the 1960's.",0
"Brilliant, Jean - Luc! It utterly defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an'intellectual'polemicist. Incidentally, Godard didn't choose the Stones'track of Sympathy With the Devil. Ironic that Godard's one - time great friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made best film about film - making ever, and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris! It just happened to be the track they were working on when the'film'started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios. It's hard to credit that Godard actually believed all that Marxist and Maoist kant.",0
"Good song, but it has now been played to death by this DVD.",0
"Firstly, this is a very dated film, non - focused in its exposition of the left wing political revolution. < br / > < br / > No wonder, the DVD came free with The Sunday Times!",0
Jean Luc Godard's Marxist polemic is as close to unwatchable a film as you're likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker. I finally gave up and just chapter - skipped my way to the Stones segments.,0
"< br / > < br / > It almost sounds intriguing? Well, it's not. Yeah.",0
"< br / > < br / > Let's reprise the story. There was so much potential here. So you are warned, if you haven't seen the movie yet. After rape no. But he makes an impression on her. I beg to differ. < br / > < br / > Rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before.",0
My vote is three.,0
I mean really.,0
So you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can. This is absolutely not a girls film.,0
The martial arts scenes are brief unimaginative. Is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey? ( Hardly. ),0
"The guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no - one else. Yes, you heard right, he PLUGGED his new FILM. SPOILERS HEREIN < br / > < br / > My High School did all they could to try and motivate us for exams. < br / > < br / > I'll admit, I was actually pumped to see this.",0
I didn't see a scope on that thing. This movie was horrible. What reflected the light?? he coulda been long gone. Ice - T was annoying as hell. It wouldn't blow up and kill him.,0
It ended up being 43 minutes long. This movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite.,0
This movie sucked plain and simple.,0
"Master shot, close up, close up. Had the original casting idea been kept ( hunting Rutger, not Ice - T ), this movie might have worked. This was only the start of the downward spiral of this film. Sadly, racism had to come into the picture ( literally ) and mess it up. Gads,'Who's Line Is It Anyway'even uses more creative camera work.",0
"Minus the fangs, of course. They're both terrible, nasty people. That's more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it.",0
"Ditto for "" In the Warzone. "" < br / > < br / > The viewer encounters pretentious references to Ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations. Is it the acting, or the script that is bad, or both? It is trite, overwrought and tedious. < br / > < br / > There are some very fine English films available with content similar to this film. "" Nil by Mouth "" is an excellent, far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu. Just emailed a friend who's in film school about this flick.",0
I can hardly believe it. He's perfectly awful. Sydney Pollack directed this film?,0
"But, even such accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey.",0
The score is servicable. And the non - plot developed!,0
). I made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the outcome.,0
"One of the most peculiar oft - used romance movie plots is this one : A seriously messed - up man falls in love with a terminally ill woman, who turns his life around before dying. Instead, they got the expressionless face and heavy German accent of Ms. Keller, who comes across as more of a scary Teutonic stereotype ( "" You VILL eat ze omelet! "" He plays a control - freak, emotionally constipated race - car driver, and plays an unlikeable character lifelessly. than anything like lovable.",0
This film has no heart. Yawneroony!,0
"Rosario Dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge. Forgive me I simply couldn't find her. For Rosario Dawson fans only, though be warned there's several real reasons why is NC17.",0

"What deep dark secret was he hiding behind that forehead? I love Alec Guinness. Was he in love with the father's mistress? Actually, he is not bad in it. THAT would have been a great story!",0
"As to what Odile Vernois thought of her co - star, no record is available. The film has no other reason for existence. I'm sure Guinness did the film to get a free trip to Paris out of it. < br / > < br / > At least Alec got a trip to Paris out of deal. But I wouldn't wait through the film for it. Unfortunately it goes downhill from there.",0
"Teachers "" get an F. SMALL PLOT DETAILS REVEALED! One can just imagine the filmmakers saying, "" We need JoBeth to shed her top... hmmm... WARNING! However, the execution is dreadful. < br / > < br / > I can find virtually nothing positive to say about this film.",0
"Maybe, but everything is portrayed too far - fetched. But, this movie was horrible and there is no way around it. I did not laugh once throughout this entire movie. Whoever wrote the script was all over the place.",0
"I must confess to cringing through many scenes -'though I continued to watch to the end. ! I wonder why? < br / > < br / > As to young Mr Macchio, does he speak that way in * every * movie?",0
The characters were all one - dimensional. I wasn't drawn in for even a second.,0
"Revenge is one of my favorite themes in film. Thumbs down. Character's are thin, dialog is monotonous, etc. Do we rejoice in Dawson's revenge?",0
"There used to be a time when < br / > < br / > And what is the film's message?

"Amen to that! I don't remember who I went with, which theater I was in, or even which city. Maybe they think they can reform him, or something. That was hands - down THE most terrifying moment ever recorded on film. Forget Damian, forget Rosemary's Baby. John Ritter had a quote in TV Guide about the time that Problem Child 3, which he was not in, came out. This kid takes the cake. The only difference is, we are supposed to feel sorry for him because he's a "" problem child. "" I really don't know.",0
He can put a room on fire! A sequel is an even worse fate. Rent CHICKEN RUN instead.,0
I know I'm being too kind to it.,0
Not hardly.,0
"For this movie, that's witty. The first scene in'Problem Child'has a baby peeing into a nun's face. But never mind all that.",0
"No, he is not so much a brat, as he is a kid with severe emotional problems. Add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort.",0
It didn't. My girlfriend and I were stunned by how bad this film was.,0
"But "" Descent, "" though making some important points, never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning. What I wanted to see * was * the "" descent "" or degeneration of Dawson's character.

It fails badly at both.,0
Oscar for this guy!,0
Even when it has already been written for them!,0
They said it was a comedy!,0
I am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this. Have I ever seen a film more shockingly inept?,0
"Tell them to sit through'Head Above Water '. Does anyone know what it means? "" Why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course.",0
Avoid!,0
Horror movie? Don't you even think about renting this unless you want to mock at producers.,0
"And Rosario Dawson? The Adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist. I can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free. Wrong. It's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself. As for the Maya character, she didn't seem like a real person. Anyway I'm ashamed for Hollywood that this movie was even made.",0
"Or as my friend reading over my shoulder says : "" It's the best movie I have ever seen. """,0
"Well, it Do ya hear me? I haven't decided which. First off, I'm not here to dog this movie. He's missed his bear. Poor Yeti! You can't help but feel sorry for it.",0
Fire seemed to be a predominate theme throughout. I mean these guys were frozen well maybe not. Gimme a break.,0

"NBC used to air what appeared to be the "" director's cut "", with at least an hour of extra footage - - mostly flashbacks - - injected into the proceedings with all the subtlety of a "" Gilligan's Island "" episode. Still, the personality conflicts and excruciating military detail eventually tear at one's patience.",0
Karen Wallace ( Grant ) is the hysterical b! Capt.,0
I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers. The movie was filled with well known faces. Everything was taken too seriously. My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about.,0
"Oh, not "" Airport "" the original. < br / > < br / > "" We're on our own! He's in all these disaster movies. Except for George Kennedy. "", says pilot Jack Lemon. He is so right.",0

"This is one of the dumbest films, I've ever seen. It rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all.",0
