What a pity that it isn't!,1
His character is more malevolent than usual. Three funny words. The take on lawyers is also superb.,1
< br / > < br / > It rates a 7.,1
The direction is good.,1
It's overkill. She is that good.,1
< br / > < br / > What is it about celebrities and fans?,1
"< br / > < br / > This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend. Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like "" Little Miss Sunshine "".",1
< br / > < br / > S ~ PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE!,1
"It is here, a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help. Instead, this may prove to be one of William's more serious performances.",1
It is not a Hitchcockian thriller. Everyone is very believable.,1
This is no americanized movie. Neither is it a predictable movie.,1
"Also, it needed a little more suspense. Not cheap, just hokey.",1
8 / 10 Recommended. Toni Collette also stars.,1
That's good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear. It's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn't sew - up any of plot openings or back - story.,1
The book is probably better.,1
Thank Heaven. This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying.,1
Oh Yes. Great plot?,1
A real campy hoot.,1
He dies early in the film ( or does he? ),1
< br / > < br / > Recommended.,1
The one we are witness of - the movie.,1
The acting was wonderful.,1
Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. Out of a possible 100 % I give this film a mere 71 %.,1
You won't regret it.,1
Titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st Century. There is nothing wrong with this movie.,1
SEVEN years apart? More a case of intrigue! $ 10.,1
It's a damn good movie. What's inexplicable? Is a single one of them bad? Not that Titanic has none of that.,1
"Everyone has, and is entitled to, his / her own taste. 0 rating by imdb. 2 % 10 ratings and 9. 0.",1
Guaranteed! It will be almost impossible. Why so criticised? The acting was the real effect. Could it get better? A landmark.,1
"Overall, I give Titanic 8. 5 / 10. Bethany Cox.",1
We get a love story on a sinking boat. The story is simple and it works. com / ojhoyn ). Oh yes!,1
They make for a good on - screen couple.,1
"! It was a good risk. Good story, good flow, good actors!!",1
"The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. It has its problems ( what movies don't ) but still, it's enjoyable. Titanic has to be one of my all - time favorite movies.",1
They trusted each other. Titanic is a great film down to it's very core. Titanic is a classic.,1
My heart won't go on from this one. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. No exceptions. The music has become iconic and legendary.,1
"101 - year - old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re - watch the film. Was that Leonardo's real nose? Was it worth the hype?",1
She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.,1
"PEOPLE make the film a huge success. ha! < br / > < br / > Personally, I LOVE this film. With Titanic, everyone was in awe.",1
"Nonsense, "" I thought. I loved it! Then - the details. First - the directing.",1
How lame is that? I will gladly side with the majority this time around. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted.,1
"I was utterly transfixed. How anyone can say effects were bad is beyond me. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, "" flying "". "" Iceberg, right ahead! "" I cried again.... in all the same places. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation.",1
"I am not a parent, neither am I a male. He should be offered more serious roles.",1
But Morphe It just may be haunted. The tracking and the cuts need to be slow.,1
"Warning, get the Kleenex ready. Movie's. Yes it touched my heart.",1
A must see for those who care about their families.,1
"Steamy ""? I was prepared for disappointment. < br / > < br / > Boy, was I wrong! It's 1968.",1
A romantic. Excellent!!! Fine acting and directing.,1
This is a movie I will show to my children.,1
She was such a great actor for being so little. lol.,1
"Even after he reluctantly takes her back, he's not too upset when she's kidnapped. < br / > < br / > The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context. What held my attention in The King of Masks was the grimness of the setting : small - town China in the 1930's.",1
The acting is inspired.,1
Very impressive. Actors are brilliant. The whole film is in loops. Watch it 9 / 10.,1
Casting is great.,1
The story is absorbing.,1
< br / > < br / > Maybe I'm reading too much into this film ; but I don't think so! < br / > < br / > But don't get me started on that...,1
King of Masks ( Bian Lian in China ) is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film. Wang Bianlian's story goes on from there.,1
"If you can find this series, give it a look. Heinlein's political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is present. ), but it's far superior to the film. But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. And I think they did pretty well with this.",1
Highly recommended : - ) 9 / 10 stars.,1
"Farewell, my Concubine, The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples. Fans of Farewell My Concubine should look carefully at Master Liang's portrayal of a male playing female role in Chinese Opera. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader. But the son eventually is found out to be a girl. All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art.",1
"Kudos all around. """,1
"It was weak, cliche and about as subtle as aledgehammer. What a shame. Despite the times and the influences, the man is kind and good.",1
The story is simple.,1
"I find that great. OK, let's get this clear. A round device that creates a wormhole.",1
"There is also humour, sometimes quite subtle, at appropriate points. < br / > < br / > The story is fun, emotional, and complex.",1
"This deserves a lot better treatment. Until it comes out on widescreen, rent it.",1
It may just change you forever once you have seen it.,1
< br / > < br / > Cheers.,1
In color too!,1
10-Oct,1
"All the supporting players round it out, and I do wonder who trained all those elephants. Her shape and way she moves is distinct from Taylor's.",1
"The real star is the bungalow, one of most beautiful interior sets in movie history.",1
To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film : the hubris of man.,1
I have never forgotten it.,1
"Most, if not all, of these cops are borderline (? ) Highly recommended.",1
Buaku rules. I do have some complaints though.,1
Oh the insanity! the Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence.,1
Fact : Stargate SG - 1 is a cheesy sci - fi TV series. Or couch for that matter either. < br / > < br / > There's no escaping facts.,1
"Scott Bartlett's'OffOn'is nine minutes of pure craziness. < br / > < br / > There appears to be some confusion about the film's release date. In a sense, the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology.",1
This was'nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned. It shocked me. It amazed me.,1
Kay Kyser's mysteries would be a good example.,1
The dialogues by Vijay Tendulkar is also great. You cannot not be impressed by this movie.,1
A man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father. My God what a natural expressions she carried!!!,1
He played as an inspector - turned - alcoholic character. Each one played their part par excellence.,1
"Ardh Satya "" is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema. < br / > < br / > The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly. At many scenes, the film has Hair - raising moments. Finally he gets suspended.",1
Words fall short for this great work. ! An absolute classic! This movie has stood the test of times.,1
This is a very good and a classic film.,1
I love this show! Its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other. < br / > < br / > I say though that it turned out just fine. Maybe even better.,1
"Is the needle on the center a half - truth? "" Any story comprises a premise, characters and conflict. "".",1
Do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker? Still it's of interest if you're a Wood fan.,1
"Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr. fan, I prefer to appreciate his "" boundless enthusiasm "" and acknowledge his shortcomings. The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background. His movies are fun, but his personal story is one racked with pain.",1
"< br / > < br / > Sharply acted, with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads. The cast also contains Bruno Lawrence, who is probably best remembered by American audiences from the film "" Smash Palace "".",1
! Never before seen such a sick and twisted thing. The Story is good and the actors do their thing very well.,1
"And this isn't that nice cool, clean violence so beloved of US cinema - this stuff is nasty, painful and HURTS!",1
! He is just hilarious!,1
"Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, later moved back into Japan, and alienated for it.",1
"< br / > < br / > 7 or 8 out of 10. If thats not your cup of tea, proceed with caution.",1
One of the problems is the cultural / language one.,1
< br / > < br / > Should you see this film? Why?,1
"The movie takes place in a very harsh environment, and is therefore pretty violent and tough. If you've only seen Miikes far - out movies ( Ichi the killer, Fudoh etc. )",1
"I don't want to give away too much. < br / > < br / > I cannot sing Shinjuku's praises enough. But, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. Shinjuku is however, one of Miike's most perfectly formed films.",1
"This was the beginning of it all! ! Keep watching, first season is a blast!",1
"but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons, but he isn't confident. < br / > < br / > The Episode is better than most people give credit for, like any new sitcom the first episode isn't always fantastic. he cannot speak normally! I hope we see the Friends reunite!",1
ENJOY FRIENDS! And that's how the greatest comedy of TV started!,1
"This, in turn means even more on - world episodes, which is perfectly understandable. But still, top notch science fiction! Stargate SG - 1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie "" Stargate. "" I am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject. Any Gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a "" System Lord. "" < br / > < br / > My rating : 8.",1
< br / > < br / > Bravo. The pilot is extremely well done.,1
"= ) But in reality, he was just deceiving her. < br / > < br / > Ps : I just loooove Joey's and Chandler's haircuts in this first season!",1
Why did it sound like the husband kept calling her Appy? It ruined a great episode and so I can only give it a 6.,1
< br / > < br / > End of Spoiler.,1
It's violent and gory with a sick & twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences.,1
At the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation. Well its about time.,1
"Great acting, great plot, great dialogue, great suspense. A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident.",1
"Throughout the first eight seasons, the Goa'uld are the primary antagonists. In ninth season a new villain emerges, the Ori. Stargate SG - 1 follows and expands upon the Egyptian mythologies presented in Stargate.",1
"In the case of RIGHT TO DIE, he takes the latter approach, and it definitely works. Fans of the HBO series "" Tales From the Crypt "" are going to love this MOH episode.",1
< br / > < br / > Really good effort.,1
This piece brings it and doesn't appologize. I liked this one a lot. Do NOT watch whilst eating pudding.,1
"What more could you ask for, you might ask? His airbag worked, her's didn't.",1
But the fun is in the journey.,1
"The rest of the cast is fun. He was in Rounders, too.",1
"It's a postcard of NY. It's a simple hook, but it works.",1
Great love story for the soul! Thanks! This was a great movie.,1
"Most on this channel, whether "" set "" there, in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, L. A. I'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made.",1
"SG1 also excels in humour, from O'Neill's wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd! < br / > < br / > The top - notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life.",1
"I think you'll like it. To be entertained. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure the women love him.",1
It never did.,1
"< br / > < br / > God Bless her, her family and future endeavors.",1
Fresher. Well acted.,1
"However, i enjoyed this movie.",1
"If you are already happy, then you will be euphoric. and Vartan holds his own. I just can't understand the negative comments about this film.",1
Why not! Thanks Fox for producing it.,1

The Gospel road was one of them.,1

"All said and done this is one good Movie. Faster this changes better for "" Bollywood "". This is as authentic scene you can get in rural India.",1

"A story about a woman's fight against harsh injustice. And that's when the problems start. Their family is complete when Nandini has a boy, Raja ( Master Jai Gidwani ).",1
"This picture has everything any movie could ever have. Yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance. It's all in there, adding up to a myth.",1
Then things go terribly wrong.,1

"When she wants to leave, Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India. < br / > < br / > The film's biggest strength is the performances.",1
Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role. And boy Aish is mad hot. Nana Patekar was excellent as her father - in - law. The movie was disturbing at moments.,1
His throw - away comic - book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film's primary gripping drama. Uneven Bollywood drama.,1
"Try the concert out, it really is amazing.",1
This show was one year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 1960's ; Woodstock. This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle. < br / > < br / > The Original Drum and Bass.,1
"It's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to love it as much as I do.",1
"Also performing well was young actress Rebecca Lusterio. She did a great job portraying Bikay, the younger sister of Duroy. His great vision and creativity really helped this film.",1
"Beating up all the bad guys and the end - of - level boss is much fun. This is especially infuriating with the Level 5 boss. As a kid, I loved this game.",1
"And sometimes not even then. < br / > < br / > As with all long - running series, they were numerous cast changes.",1
I hope for a sequel very soon. No pun intended.,1

It is at the same time a very brave ending. ).,1
"The ending to this movie is top notch. In fact, as Irene, her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first.",1
"He was right. We had Blackboard Jungle, On the Waterfront and so on. The acting is so bad it's hard to believe. A little subtle masochism. I don't. Sexual tension between the sisters.",1
"Whew! Teenage sister Vicki is quite a piece of work as well, reminiscent of Carmen Sternwood in THE BIG SLEEP.",1
"- - bare - chested. I truly don't know where it was shown. Boy, are they bad, too!",1

! This great film has both!,1
An unusual film from Ringo Lam and one that's strangely under - appreciated. Blood is everywhere. Several horses get chopped up. It's very unexpected.,1
"( If you want to know how, see the film! ) Burning Paradise "" put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance.",1
"It's sweet, funny and warms your heart.",1
But over the years they've turned into a family ). From episode one I was hooked. I will sadly miss it. Robert wrote something that felt close to reality. I never want show to die.,1
"? Overall, I like this film lot!",1
"had me in stitches. All in all, this is a good movie. I don't get the rating, honestly I don't. But the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation. 7.",1
"I think I'll give it a pass on those factors too, and just enjoy the story. Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr. Screweyes. I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie, so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.",1
"I wouldn't call "" We're Back! True, it's escapism, but the perceptive kind. Worth seeing.",1
all who go against this movie are killing their inner child!,1
Have you seen the hills have eyes 2? There still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing.,1
"The Japanese people (? ) Like I said pure underground. It don't sound that bad at all, but it CAN make you go nuts ).",1
The worst is the eye scene.,1
Wrong. So I popped this sucker in and sat down. The film fails to shock.,1
"The Jaffa would die. I haven't always been a fan, but the show grew on me.",1
There are really only 3 scene's that could be considered gore.,1
'.,1
! It scared me.,1
Take your chance to watch it!,1
This review is for the Devils Experiment. We all want blood and gore. Wonderful. Why do I watch horror films? Why do people bash it.,1
A lot of people unfairly sh! Some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest. These two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings. 8. t on this series but several of the Guinea Pig videos are fairly entertaining. Her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling.,1
"< br / > < br / > The episodes are light ( innocent and easy to watch ) and very creative. They are simply fun to watch. Their tone is serious, but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor. The characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature. What happens next was always unpredictable.",1
"The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film. I had my doubts, mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year. This was one of the smartest, most well - written movies I had ever seen. "" It is truly a must - see. Boy, was I in for a surprise.",1
You're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie. Watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way.,1
Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying show. I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. The villains ( Wraiths ) are so improbable as to be ludicrous. Yet'O'Neill's'tactical instincts always seem sound.,1
Ask yourself where she got the gun?,1
"She may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act. All in all, House of Games is a truly first rate thrill ride.",1
But who is conning who here? When does the hunter turn into the prey?,1
Get ready for it : This is one of my favourite films of all time.,1
It is wonderful.,1
"House Of Games "" does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do. < br / > < br / > It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it.",1
Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna.,1
Not a big deal. I loved them all. It is a great loss. It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series.,1
Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. From the opening scene this movie just gets you. House of Games is spell binding.,1
Everything flowed. The camera is very cinematic.,1
I'll say no more ).,1
House of Games sticks to its business. At this level it does succeed admirably. It is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller. It should be a natural for film festivals. What tripe.,1
"House of Games can also be viewed as a ` class - war'division movie. Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order. < br / > < br / > The gambler Mike ( played excellently by Joe Mantegna ) turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty.",1
"By this time, not only Margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked. And nothing is what it seems.",1
Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life. This movie is amazing!,1
What better comic genius to remind us of that than Jim Carry. box office disappointments. !,1
Jennifer Aniston had some good moments.,1
pittiful'as Bruce's girlfriend. It will surpass ` Titanic'as the highest grossing film of all time! ` Bruce Almighty'will sweep the Academy Awards with a record 14 Oscar wins! Almighty then!,1
Eight out of ten stars.,1
Thats all from BigV over and out! Well not actually. In fact all the characters are great.,1
< br / > < br / > A funny film.,1
I am a VERY big Jim Carrey fan.,1
He was both funny and sad. I rate this film 9 / 10.,1
God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways.,1
"Bruce Almighty "" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers.",1
! Hallelujah!,1
"It's just God. < br / > < br / > OK, that was kinda long. And it's really funny. But as a plot, it works well.",1
"In this way, I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power.",1
"< Jim Carrey playing God? Confused? Nothing is sacred anymore. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running.",1
"Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.",1
"I only enjoyed the fighting scenes, everything else is rubbish. He's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help. < br / > < br / > Recommended.",1
his parents ask Dickie whether he'd prefer to watch TV all night. I found it to be better than the short story it was based on.,1
A corker of a concluding scene!,1
To see their heroes in action one more time. Why? That's the way I feel about Doc Savage.,1
"Obviously, the Newspaper Comic Strip was one parent, providing the visual / narrative method of story telling. There were mediums that were ancestral to them. A temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is Baseball.",1
< br / > < br / > Best scene? Priceless!,1
"Where did the Goa'uld ( Ra's race ) come from? < br / > < br / > That was only the beginning of the adventure. It explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention. Such as, how was the Stargate activated without a human computer?",1
I give it 7 out of 10. Ron Ely is just right as Doc. ).,1
But they are very close to the feel of the pulps. I think the problem is the movie's schizophrenic.,1
"This is a VERY entertaining movie. The fight sequences are lively, brisk and, above all, not gratuitous. Ron Ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play Doc. This is NOT one of those martial arts films. Another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the "" bad guy "" ( Seas ) is dealt with.",1
"A prime candidate for DVD release, it is certainly overdue.",1
Ron Ely is a God.,1
B. ) Not to mention kung - fu.,1
< br / > < br / > Observation.,1
"etc. ) Outstanding cast, top to bottom.",1
So what does he do?,1
I won't describe the way Max rises to the occasion. Soon he has a whole chain of stores.,1
"A horrible person, yes, but never a paper hanger!",1
The cattle cars are shown in this picture with Jewish people heading to the Nazi gas chambers.,1
"I still can't get over it. He betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse. Maybe not Oscar worthy, but the best of her career.",1
This one is tough to watch - - as an earlier reviewer says. Knox as the Nazi is brilliant.,1
Miss Dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience.,1
"Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. The phone conversation across the border is really memorable. Not too deep. Check out lines about curtains, etc. Enjoy the movie!",1
"I'll kill him. """,1
I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler. One beauty of this film is that it is not pro - American.,1
The movie had me laughing from start to finish. ).,1
Just as it should be.,1
"Director Alexander Hall made mostly comedies, was reportedly engaged to Lucy at some point. Don't want to give away any spoilers, so you'll have to catch it on Turner Classic Movies.",1
Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are on hand for excellent support. < br / > < br / > Entertaining if a little on the long side.,1
( Maltin's movie book does not contain it. ) There are a lot of laughs in the process. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are hilarious.,1
"'< br / > < br / > The crime - solving here is standard fare, although a fine cast of character actors helps bring material to life. You look like my Aunt Nellie! And the effervescent Joan Blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb : "" Good grief! Ludicrously frocked, Melvyn Douglas delivers some of the best lines : "" I'd walk down Main Street in a Turkish towel before I'd let any woman control my life! """,1
"It sounded more like anti - Fascism speeches than the voices of real children. While this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today. The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman.",1
But still having to deal with the rumours. They family went through hell.,1
8 out of 10.,1
< br / > < br / > See it!,1
"So although cleared by an initial inquest, they were later prosecuted and convicted. The story suggesting her innocence was unlikely ( a dingo was alleged to have taken it ), but those implying her guilt even more so, and there was no solid evidence against her. This review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based. Judge not lest ye be judged "" is one of them.",1
"The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured. But at the same, the media / public opinion is understandable. If you ask me, this is an under - appreciatted classic. < br / > < br / has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable.",1
"She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is highly suspicious. A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical.",1
"Even her accent is almost, but not quite, spot on. No - one believed them. How could we as a nation even sit in judgement?",1
I found it hard to like anyone in this film. Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are.,1
The cast just makes it that much more appealing.,1
A bit different. A pretty good film.,1
They are going by train to Davis's relatives house.,1
< br / > < br / > ( Spoiler warning! ) It captured the themes of the story brilliantly. It's an issue that has to be constantly addressed.,1
The performances are excellent.,1
Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news - media. < br / > < br / > Lindy Chamberlain was this woman.,1
"I've always liked Sam, who I could identify with completely, and Meryl was perfect as always. all quite convincingly. The author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did. I think it's not only a very good, but a very important, movie. Beautiful photography, haunting music. It was also highly technical evidence, difficult for a layman to understand.",1
"The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo. How could this happen? Suddenly, she hears Azaria crying.",1
""". Only after years in jail was he exonerated.",1
"But when I saw it, I was shocked at what it portrayed. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi'best movies ever.",1
"5, and a perfect 10 for Streep.",1
"Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy, as she always does.",1
The Aussie accents get a bit thick at times but notcomprehensible. Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them.,1
< br / > < br / > 3.,1
"Needless to say, Mat gets dragged into George's world. Well, that was the plan anyway.",1
And then things go wrong.,1
Good Fun.,1
": ) The penalty however, I was disappointed in. I loved the character of Matt, and also Tiny.",1
"Equally significantly, it reminds us that World War II had a purpose. Maybe.",1
i'll keep checking in.,1
The previous reviewer has said it exactly.,1
You can find it at : http : / / www. johntopping.,1
"org. It's September of 2004, and I keep hoping - - deep sigh.",1
!,1
"Of course the film isn't a masterpiece, i don't think it was aiming to be. People, enjoy it for what it is.",1
The real star is of course the General Lee. < br / > < br / > Back to the movie. REALITY CHECK : The original series wasn't that good.,1
It's just a great dumb movie! It was the perfect Dukes plot. I'm a huge fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show.,1
It blew me away.,1
Loved the movie. The possible exception is Now Voyager.,1
"Again, A MUST SEE!",1
A fantastic Arabian adventure. There's hardly a down moment here. 8 / 10. Jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse. And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful.,1
And look out for the moment where he's tricked back into his bottle! Also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet.,1
He certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the UK. Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this film. This was Veidt's career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser.,1
"It doesn't kill the film, but it does weaken it.",1
"Just watch, you'll see.",1
"Naziism had to be stopped, and anything that helped do it was good. < br / > < br / > All the other actors did ).",1
"Every frame has its own magical charm. < br / > < br / > Rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film. Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief. "" Georges Perinal's photography is some of the best use of Technicolor. Here is a film that will never grow old.",1
An amazing work.,1
They arrive Basora where Ahamad and the princess ( gorgeous June Duprez ) fall in love.,1
"One only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides. Great film and although an'oldie ', definitely a goldie '. In my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. Who then watches effects? I hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on DVD someday.",1
< br / > < br / > The rest of the cast do fine work. Here is a villain worth watching. Aged Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of Legend.,1
Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden. He does awaken her.,1
From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter. The production designs are just stunning in this movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > Encounting treachery around them, Lukas successfully deals with situation. He knows he must return to Europe on a clandestine mission and return he does.",1
He set the bar very high. The casting couldn't have been better.,1
"Conrad Veidt played baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever, this and Casablanca, and then died. and Love not only conquers but annihilates everything.",1
I recommend it. Yet they fit into the story well. The effects fit with the script.,1
Sabu is the Thief. Whoa there!,1
Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films. ! NOW comes the M - G - M DVD ( 3 Dec 2002 ) issue.,1
"For a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind. Those effects still work their charm. Still, I don't think anyone under eight ought to see "" Thief of Bagdad. "" The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram. ( Howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film.",1
Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was. Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work. They're made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.,1
This is a most handsome film.,1
What killed him? Also it's highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia ; the role lay too high for him.,1
"For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on the earth. He's shown in a recording studio once late in his life. It's why both became the legends that they are.",1
The result was a wonderful movie. 00 or less.,1
I am on journey too. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable.,1
Will soften even hardiest heart. < br / > < br / > I am now restless waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel.,1
Stunning. Even the little moments just melt your heart.,1
"Highly recommended. The monologue he has about the need to kill is gut - wrenching, just to mention one scene.",1
"I saw the elements more clearly : Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything. I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago. etc.. But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel that's more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before.",1
"Still, I watched it!",1
On the train he met a French girl Celine. Then the romantic story unfolded. Love needs mutual understanding.,1
!,1
They meet on the Budapest - Vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together.,1
"This is a slow moving story. I really mean that. The story builds gently, systematically and substantive. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but I may be underestimating their intelligence. The dialog is fascinating. < br / > < br / > BOTTOM LINE : The movie's flow is slow. It's truly fantastic. No action. Still it did not ruin the movie.",1
"Ethan Hawke as "" Jessie "" comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a Maynard G. Krebs of the nineties. Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots. < br / > < br / > If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. The primary reason to see "" Before Sunrise, "" is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines.",1
"But it certainly spoke to me. This disgusts me. They have a great chemistry in their roles. I, on the other hand, felt completely the opposite. ! It's very intimate.",1
!,1
The actors play absolutely brilliantly. This movie is intelligent.,1
"No one does, at least that's deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the'town ', in Vienna, until his plane the next morning.",1
"< br / > < br / > This is "" love "" in the real world. Wonderful acting, excellent script, and beautiful locations. It's so real, so engaging and funny. Young love, at it's best. And this is what makes "" Before Sunrise "" so good. < br / > < br / > Once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books. It's PERFECT.",1
"That's it, that's the movie. They talk and fall in love.",1
< br / > < br / > See it and it may change your way of life.,1
i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie. i watched this movie 10 years ago. it also made me want to ride the train around Europe!,1
"I didn't know what to expect from it, but nor did the young couple. We are too afraid to check that out.",1
SEE IT!,1
Few can claim that. It does not strike me as totally wrong.,1
But that's not the point. Dialog and acting are great.,1
I want to see them as soon as possible again. They are both masterpieces. I want to go to Vienna.,1
"Yesterday I have probably watched this movie for third or fourth time, and I still love it. My vote is ten.",1
Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation.,1
What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. This movie is mostly all dialogue - based.,1
There is the love in a marriage. ! One cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie. There is the divine love of God that is beautifully portrayed.,1
< br / > < br / > Definitely worth seeing... buy DVD.,1
"< br / > < br / > The film offers excellent acting all around. They are crossing the border to the United States from Mexico. Watch on the Rhine "" must have come as a result of those years.",1
What about all people of all cultural backgrounds?,1
What for is there faith?,1
"Exactly : We've seen this before. It's about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies. A nice touch! 7 / 10 This fact is the main problem I have with the film, cause it's not really about the robbers at all.",1
"Dana's role is accessible, natural, and entertaining. The title cards are also incredibly clever.",1
"Until then "" thats Great Television ""!",1
"< br / > < br / > Canadian cinema suffers from several problems. Snotty of me, isn't it? < br / > < br / > Desmond Howl had it all.",1
I enjoyed this film yet hated it because I wanted to help this guy! A MUST SEE!,1
I don't know why.,1
Yet he has musical genius. She learns to trust him over a period of time.,1
An amazing read!,1
"Still, the melodramatic touch is present. It will be so much more fun! The bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt.",1
Watch this movie if you ever get a chance. Even the characters name ( Bodo ) is funny.,1
8 / 10.,1
I love this film.,1
"But then it doesn't try to be anything it is not. Well worth seeing. The band's performance was on the spot, each one playing their role in a deft, comical manner.",1
< br / > < br / > The acting is top - notch. Not so here. It's all about the charm.,1
"I saw it last night on TV, and was quite delighted.",1
The premise alone is appealing.,1
"Overall, this is a terrific little film, and much more fun to watch than you might imagine.",1
Since then it's become one of my favorites!,1
You will love.,1
< br > < br / > 7 / 10.,1
That's about it. The sounds are magnificant.,1
The controls are great.,1
one of the funnest mario's i've ever played. good for playing in short bursts of time.,1
"But of course, you have beat Bowser. The characters are really great. Especially for it's time. Each had about five or six challnges to get the stars. And I LOVED IT!",1
"Yes, that's right, it is.",1
Nintendo is best!,1
"No time limits. Mario must save the day again. If you have an N64, buy this game. You enter the world by going through a painting. It's great.",1
There is brief language in this.,1
England has never been like this. < br / > < br / > My biggest criticism is scenery. It is far too lush.,1
"I thought you overqualified. "" Lucky us! I wish she had read a little more. I liked Emma and also recommend it.",1
"No doubt, however, there will be more to come in the near future. This scheme goes disastrously wrong, however, as Elton has no interest in Harriet, but has fallen in love with Emma herself. < br / > < br / > The main character is Emma Woodhouse, a young lady from an aristocratic family in Regency England. Instead, her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends. Then there are all those Austen sequels churned out by modern writers ).",1
He is certainly well - matched to Gwyneth Paltrow. Mr. Knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films.,1
"This is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the Cameroon. It will leave you, as it left me, with many questions about exactly how this change occurred. They made the movie two years ago, not yesterday.",1
"And then, the breathtaking English countryside, where every situation gets such a magic and dream - like dimension... a really enjoyable and deserving movie. The movie respected this subtle irony, not disregarding the comic element ( Miss Bates above all ). And how I envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear!",1
"< < < sigh > > > Sophie Thompson's turn as Ms Bates is virtuoso acting of the finest ( oh, napkins, sorry! ) and it would have been much more in keeping with rest of the movie.",1
"Good, but not brilliant.",1
a good cast.,1
).,1
"The world goes round and love abounds, but Emma is about to miss the boat. Now, if she can but stop long enough to realize it.",1
"The story is often amusing, endearing, and at times, quite touching. ).",1
"Highly recommended. There could not be more perfect casting, IMO.",1
( In broken English with English subtitles ).,1
Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. One of the most endearing characters I have come across in ages. < br / > < br / > I ADORED it!,1
2 thumbs up.,1
Make the World go away.,1
they really work well together! but each to their own!,1
"I'm going with the 1 - 0 on this and here's why. Yes... Looked interesting, wasn't expecting much though. I was wrong.",1
).,1
Enjoy movie.,1
"Now they've turned their attention to the court system in Cameroon, Africa. With these 2 behind the bench. And who said that justice isn't served anymore? Not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment. The judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury. Ya! They often carry out maximum penalties!",1
"Give it a try, you may just feel same way about it as i do. This should become a cult favorite. The two leads are great and really carry the film.",1
That would have been great! The theme song is sweet!,1
"Tweaked a little bit,'Nothing'could be a children's film. All that's left is what they don't hate, and a big empty white space.",1
"I was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing. Oh well, poor marketing I guess. Instead, we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream. If you have big screen though, you might want to wear shades.",1
"They had just one scenery, a bunch of actors and a plot.",1
"It seemed so simple! There's nothing there, but also'something'there.",1
It was unlike any movie we'd ever seen before. The plain white cover and title intrigued me.,1
And it does.,1
However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try.,1
There's nothing but white space! Could the 2 actors make this work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes?,1
5million! ). What has happened?,1
"( And keep watching past the credits for the final scene... just don't ask me to explain it. ) NOTHING ( 3 + outta 5 stars ) Another weird premise from the director of the movie "" Cube "". There is literally NOTHING outside of their small two - story house. The actors are fine when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick.",1
We've all heard or read about it in some kind of con - text. What would you do if you were all alone in the world?,1
When looking up this movie I found one particular review which urged people NOT to see this film. See NOTHING!,1
"In this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business, he was a broadway producer before he started this. The story never really got lost in this frantic pace. In this way "" Sitting On A Backyard Fence "" was much more appropriate to the story. < br / > < br / > All in all a great film with a sour ending. These sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well. < br / > < br / > The only problem I had with the film were the enormous productions at the end.",1
"< br / > < br / > The ice cream cone is invented in New York. < br / > < br / > DOUG : Six movies in three months. 089 : Footlight Parade ( 1933 ) - released 9 / 30 / 1933, viewed 5 / 5 / 07. He was 5'7 "", square - headed, and talked with an odd New York accent. The funny thing about Cagney was that he didn't really look like a leading man in the traditional sense. Joan Blondell is also excellent as the acid - tongued secretary - turned - love interest. The Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable. < br / > < br / > KEVIN : After a long and busy break, we hit another Busby Berkeley musical from Warner Bros. Got to be a new record.",1
The numbers are flawless! It's completely crazy! And you know what? There mustn't be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking.,1
"< br / > < br / > Of course Cagney alone does not make Footlight the classic that it is. Gentility and morality made sure of it. He is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend.",1
Enjoy. Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows. This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs.,1
A wonder.,1
It sounds it to me.,1
< br / > < br / > And what's the story line?,1
He plays the role with a lot of confidence. Once again the musical numbers also feature a young Billy Barty. < br / > < br / > A recommendable early genre movie. His musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really.,1
But we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles. And you can see the mutual adoration in every scene. ).,1
"! Quite a contrast from his "" Public Enemy "" 2 years earlier.",1
Sit back and enjoy ride! Cagney is always terrific.,1
After a while it gets a bit too much. < br / > < br / > But this is a pretty strange movie. I've got a great idea for a prologue!,1
But who cares?,1
"Besides those already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is at his flustered best here. But it's all in fun. """,1
"< br / > < br / > The rest of the cast gives their best, as well. ).",1
"Wrong. Shorts, news reels, serials, and cartoons would later serve the purpose. Could it be that Cagney's character is patterned after Berkeley?",1
It has drama. He's fast with his feet!,1
One of Blondell's best screen roles. He wished he'd done a few more musicals in his career and I wish he had.,1
"Footlight Parade "" is fascinating on so many levels. < br / > < br / > The Pre - Code stuff is fun. "" It's a catalog of'30s Warner Bros. sensibilities.",1
"The overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing. A thoroughly enjoyable Depression era romp. And Ruby Keeler is adorable, as always.",1
"But as it is we have the Gershuni - directed film. The atmosphere is a lot grimmer, though, and some comparisons to Nicholas Roeg's and Donald Cammell's PERFORMANCE come to mind.",1
"This sub - plot, though amusing, looks like it belongs in another movie altogether. I am the proud owner of an original one - sheet poster - - lucky me!",1
Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.,1
The producers must have got something right.,1
< br / > < br / > Eventually the border is closed altogether starting a Passport to Pimlico is a real treat for all fans of British cinema.,1
"It can, however, be applied to most of the other films in the series, especially "" Passport to Pimlico "".",1
I commend pictures that try something different.,1
"With films like "" Passport to Pimlico "" it's not difficult to see why.",1
You gotta. Moncia Dean?,1
( It was never acknowledged by the Western Australian or Australian Governments ).,1
< br / > < br / > Welcome to Burgundy! Dame Margaret Rutherford is a delight as the history professor who sides with Pimlico. Merry mayhem is what would happen.,1
My finger stopped channel surfing the moment I heard Harvey's voice. It all seems to be the same old tired cartoons rehashed over and over again. My girls already accept others as they are and don't pick on others for being different. ).,1
Very moving story and worth a look.,1
Rent it for a good laugh.,1
"Jennifer is fighting with her ( ex? ) Vickie stays behind, feeling ill, as the other 2 are off to film their story. This film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time.",1
"One underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing ( as in : vintage shock - material ), and this is basically what the film thrives on.",1
His persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed. The casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre.,1
The final shot is especially sad.,1
"She brings along a camerawoman, who happens to be her sister, and another associate. The gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go. Anyway Bach's disgruntled beau follows her to Solvang, as he's not done arguing with her. ). Get this film if at all possible.",1
One is the art direction. The other thing is the comic timing.,1
A real sleeper.,1
"The story is slow and weak, but entertaining. There was no sex scenes.",1
"Also, the ending is very abrupt. It's fun. < br / > < br / > "" Hatred "" is very nice visually. Kill em'all! """,1
"< br < br / > < br / > If you expect smut, or an Evil Dead ripoff, stay away from this film. So what constitutes a real independent film? But if you dig the finer points of the horror / suspense genres, check this film out.",1
"Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, a toaster, and a frying pan...",1
We are still gay. End of story.,1
Some people need to lighten up!!! Bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community. And this is the film you should do it with!,1
"What she finds will leave the viewer stunned. This is a great film, very original.",1
Possibly the cuts and subtitles didn't help.,1
< br / > < br / > As for the cast. Dolph Lundgren is back! This however has problems.,1
The Acting is fantastic!. There is a bit of blood and violence. ! ( Lundgren Rules!!!!,1
P. S. Now u r a DEAD beat cop. I enjoyed it.,1
"< br / > < br / > Rarely has something free been so worth invaluable. Yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars. I chose Goodtimes DVD's four DVD collection of the series.",1
"It was led by German American taking his cue directly from the homeland. In 1939, Hitler took all of Czechoslovakia. He would deal with her later. It didn't turn out that way. The venue - Madison Square Garden!",1
History has been repeating itself over and over again!,1
Blair Witch and The Mummy. It was truly a lot of fun.,1
Delicious!,1
This is one of them.,1
I hardly ever agree with them anyway. ; )... Liam was great as always. I needn't have bothered! I don't know why the critics trashed this movie.,1
I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie. It was even more scary. The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963. I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time.,1
"Overall, I enjoyed it. I just wish it scared me more.",1
It seems to be a perfect day for swimming.,1
"But what a star, of course.",1
"He was in his way as good an actor as either of them, but he lacked charisma.",1
"when he's especially pleased with his misdeeds. His character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying "" Pretty neat, huh? "" Mom tries to trick convict into helping while Dad waits and hangs on for dear life. The plot is about as simple as it gets. She fires back "" Where would I go? "" A. Leonard Maltin must've been watching some other movie. The friction between them is a hoot.",1

I LOVE it!,1
"I think her'Let me dance for you scene'is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5 - 6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week.",1
I love the movie. I love the Broadway musical.,1
"I have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film. Douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part. Frankly, their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this. * * * of 4 stars. As many reviewers here have noted, the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story.",1
That is an incorrect view. < br / > < br / > This is a great movie.,1
"( He had a very different role in another Stanley Baker film "" Hell Drivers "" ). Ann Heywood was also very good as the cynical Cathie. The estate looked like an old prison. His portrayal of Johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening. He finds he is the butt of many jokes.",1
The tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive. Tsai Chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest Nicole Kidman film'The Interpretor '. Time has helped heal those wounds.,1
"This hard - boiled character is a role typical of Baker. < br / > < br / > The elder brother of the Murphy family, Johnny, is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums.",1
A man and two women. One of THE comedies of the 1970's. Richard O'Sullivan is besotted with Paula Wilcox.,1
What a pity modern comedy can't reach that high standard. The obvious ends up happening as he moves in.,1
"Perhaps they get filled in with later episodes, but that's beside the point.",1
- the 70s were the real golden age.,1
"In fact the second run of'In Charge'overlapped with the first of'House '. But there must be no naughty business. He was born to play the sex - mad Robin. "".",1

Ebert didn't even post a review for this. ).,1
"Mathieu Kassovitz is OK here, but didn't have much to do. ( Kidman Rules!!!! ). The Acting is wonderful!. The ending was very cute, and it's unpredictable throughout!, plus this movie is quite underrated as well!.",1
"The Russian woman that Nicole Kidman plays is a lot like the Julia and Katya in my photojournals. They are very cunning, ruthless, and greedy, as well as highly unfair. So check it out. com / Photojournals. That's how it works in real life. from website.",1
"Modern, original, romantic story.",1
"Funny, isn't it?",1
"< br / > < br / > I really marveled at Kidman'ability to physically appear Russian. Maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing. Instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances. I don't how or who was able to restrain her, but apparently it worked. < br / > < br / > Here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job. In effect, they teach him to be compete.

"The mountain scenery is breathtaking, and it's a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken. An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather. It's all filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty.",1
Warning stories. The Scots excel at storytelling. Where does fiction end? Magic and mystery. Archetypes. He burns with frustration.,1
It is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well. The supporting case seems quite good too.,1
"7 of 10. One thing I just thought of though. It's all made at the height of summer, LOL!",1
Excellent show.,1
Spacecamp is my favorite movie.,1
We have the power to change the future with Faster Than Light comms. Julia has been growing up fast. She already said that she doesn't like bullies.,1
Very good drama in season two. since Jessica Alba's carrier sky rocketed after the show.,1
Hurrah!,1

"It was never meant to be'real'or serious. Enjoy! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she, too, loved it.",1

It does not look unreal.,1
i would like to comment the series as a great effort.,1

"It was just like revisiting my childhood. That little robot "" Jinx "" ( friends for ever! ).",1
< br / > < br / > WOW!,1
As the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident. He rides with the firemen to the WTC and goes inside the building.,1
"But, once we got with the gist of the series, we were very quickly hooked.",1
"Watch if you can, this is the best documentary I have personally ever seen.",1
"We don't sum up facts like : Birth, Childhood, High School etc. But I don't think narration is unnecessary. So that's the purpose of adding a story in documentary. I've read most of the comments here. How many movies about the World war 2 have we seen? But what if there will be a movie in about 5 years? I agree it is wrong trying to make a lot of money out of 9 / 11. We create a story about our live.",1
< br / > < br / > Jules asked the captain to follow him into the Towers.,1
I was sick of hearing about it.,1
"My heart goes out to survivors and families of victims of 9 / 11! I liked the way it was told as a "" documentary. "" This movie had nobody known. Very well done indeed!",1
dark angel rocks!,1
"Tony is a "" White Cloud. "" The story was thought up by two French brothers living in New York. To sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible. Firefighters have a superstition about "" Probies. """,1
The feelings are so incredibly visual. It's all there.,1
You can keep your kung - fu junk. Romance is cute. This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day. < br / > < br / > IMDB asks us to rate this movie. This is why the art of filming was created! It is art without question or questions. It didn't have a sneak - peek.,1
"Life and death hang in the balance. The brothers appear to realistically portray process of becoming a NYC firefighter. < br / > < br / > In a filmmaking sense, "" 9 / 11 "" is textbook. < br / > < br / > Bottom Line : The best documentary I've ever seen. < br / > < br / > Then of course, all hell breaks loose. Nonpareil * * Warning! Seeing not only the attacks, but also the first - hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion.",1
"Tony looks proud. From the lobby, it looks, feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firemen look so utterly bewildered and frightened. There is also the eery, haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the portico outside.",1
"Few minutes later, he told me there was another, and that the WTC was under attack.",1
"Someone came into the locker room shouting "" Some building just got bombed in New York! But I don't think we thought about what they were really going though. "". My roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her.",1
"Quite simply, the footage deserves to be preserved for all time. What must the cameraman have been thinking at this time? How wrong I was.",1
I was wrong.,1
!,1
A thin story with many fine shots.,1
You can see his humor in all his movies. So Rodolfo Sonego did.,1
"Something rang a bell and I clicked on it, and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories.",1
Delightful ensemble cast. Just a nice pick me up for a dreary day.,1
"Yet, oddly, the film appears to have no comedic high - point. That's a real movie triumph for any era. At the time, RKO was turning out classic noirs by the dozens.",1
Enjoy The Movie.,1
"Thanks, Luciano!",1
But he succeeds in making a good product.,1
"One of happiness and excitement, sadness and grief.",1
"Unfortunately, it is very hard to find. A classic cartoon, always enjoyable and funny.",1
The show was hilarious to say the least.,1
"The "" story "" comes off as more of an afterthought.",1
Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant.,1
!,1
Big rock candy mountain is amazing. ( senior in high school ). bye. little bunny foo foo is the man. i recommend that people of all ages watch this movie.,1
"Some parts I found quite entertaining. I really liked it, and I watched it over and over again. I would recommend this.",1
"< br / > < br / > With his double takes and flawless line delivery, Grant "". However, the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one.",1
"If not, then don't waste your time. That's all it was meant to do and it does so.",1
"Eric Norris, son of Chuck is the director. The old master teachs to young aspirant.",1
A GREAT!,1
!,1
I gave film 7 / 10.,1
My personal opinion.,1
Recommended viewing for Sarno fans.,1
"This film is Sarno classic. Her presence in this film is hard to avoid, and spices up every scene she's involved in.",1
"She's way sexier. Another classic film only on Drive - In Classics, the best $ 2. Ah, the 1970's. < br / > < br / > I also digged Chris Jordan's Anna. 50 CAN a month you can spend. It's not real but it feels real.",1
"< br / > < br / > Definite Saturday afternoon fare, heavy on popcorn.",1
How's that?,1
Suicide.,1
I urge you to see it if you can find it.,1
I'm on the opposite end of the previous comment.,1
Only of themselves.,1
303 Brownings in dorsal turret.,1
"Russell, my fav, is gorgeous in this film.",1
Very nicely done movie.,1
"She has a gorgeous, but lethal vagina! This film is totally fantastic!! The school is lead by incredibly funny looking ( just look at the costume! ) Yes, you read right.",1
Everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it.,1
It is really well done and very entertaining. For entertainment value I found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant. He is told'Why some day you could be President '. It clearly marks a moment time for our collective consciousness.,1
very good for a laugh.,1
The bad dialogue? Why does this have such a low rating? Period.,1
"its plot, its view. is real. its meaning.",1
"How mistaken can one be! So, the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture - stream, but the main story! The girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat. This is THE spoiler. We don't see that she is alone.",1
"If this is an answer to'High Noon,'then it's an apt and apposite response.",1
Conrad plays a terrific part in this film.,1
Kirk follows him. They humiliate Sinatra and run him out of town.,1
"That's all that matters. "" You CARE about the people in "" Still Crazy "".",1
"< br / > < br / > Still Crazy, fortunately, is a solid success.",1
Loy is adorable as his pre - NOW wife. Art Direction and Editing are way above par.,1
I watch at least 3 - 4 movies a week. This movie maked me cry at the end!,1
"< br / > < br / > 7. This film is partially that, but so much more.",1
!,1
It was hilarious. I know I don't.,1
Helena was a lovely girlfriend. It's trippy. Bruce Robinson was awesome. They ought to! The scenes between Aubrey & Robinson killed me!,1
"< br / > < br / > Every performance is absolutely perfect. It's a gem. I know I didn't. I was dancing in the living room to "" All Over the World. "" But all the actors are equally brilliant. I spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it.",1
"There are couple of plot points which don't work, but overall this is quite enjoyable.",1
So I rented it.,1
They launch a comeback / reunion tour. But he wants them to start touring again first.,1
50usd.,1
"Sad for them. Ten Inch NAILS anyone? < br / > < br / > A small delight, and thanks for the memory.",1
< br / > < br / > It's a hidden diamond.,1
"YANK'EM OUT! """,1
"What a good movie! Like anyone of us. Because in Still Crazy, people are mature. Have you ever danced on Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock? Why? Far much better than Spinal Tap for instance.",1
He invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time. It was interesting to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer. Why mess with original?,1
Or don't. It contains some of the best actors possible. Tim Spall. It was just another movie I watched partly on TV.,1
< br / > < br / > The soundtrack is unbelievable.,1
"Then there were the decors, shop fronts, cars.",1
"Butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type. My mother, on other hand, adored this show.",1
< br / > < br / > Election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third. You know. There can be no denying that Hak Se Wui ( Election in English ) is a well made and well thought out film.,1
).,1
"< br / > < br / > Much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the Baton. Both films are gangster epics that are similar in form. The current Chairman, Whistle ( Chung Wang ) has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland China and the race is on to see who can recover it first.",1
This is dark and grim. The pacing is relatively slow and deliberate. Fans of gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect.,1
"Very good! So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun.",1
Another good watch would be Dragon Squad.,1
Lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years. It's the battle of the wits that makes Election stands out of the rest.,1
This film really deserves more recognition than its getting.,1
Go see it! I am certain this was intended as humour.... hoping this was intended as humour.,1
And a stab. Australia's first mainstream slasher film hits the screen with a bang.,1
! MAJOR SPOILERS!!,1
"Scary Movie?? ! Well this is Aussie, and original!!",1
I enjoyed it.,1
But the best performance is Grant's.,1
None of these comments are relevant. < br / > < br / > Cut has atmosphere. A fun somewhere.,1
"It also has appropriate low budget look, including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate. Good soundtrack, too. Cut "" is a full - tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do. Probably a bit of both. "" The rest of the cast fit their roles well, especially the lovely Jessica Napier, who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her. This also neatly - okay, messily - disposes of Kylie Minogue in the first reel.",1
This is not a bad movie.,1
"This is surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable and well made, with some decent gore!. The acting is solid!. Overall well worth watch!. Kimble Rendall does a good!",1
"however there are some good positives in this film. i enjoyed it and had some fun. if you not, than it just might grate on you. there are a few concerns about this movie.",1
"End of spoilers. Now, Cut is not the best slasher flick ever, and nor does it try to be. The killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer! Well, they're about to find out that some curses are real.",1
"Really bad slasher flicks. To quote the tagline, will they finish the film before it finishes them? ).",1
No one is great but no one is terrible either. The students ignore that. It's about a masked killer. I give it a 7. Guess what happens next?,1
There really IS something for everyone. OK?,1
What's with all the negative comments?,1
0,1
Come on people. And it was funny.,1
I like Ben Afleck.,1
Only if.,1
I rate it right up there with Christmas vacation.,1
Sure you can see where this movie is going but you don't care.,1
Great! < br / > < br / > This film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies I have seen.,1
This movie isn't as bad as I heard. I enjoyed it.,1
Gandolfini gives his typical A performance. Go see it and have a good laugh!,1
Great cast. A true classic.,1
A must see documentary!,1
you are truly blessed.,1
You deserve!,1
I truly felt for him. Could you imagine doing that?,1
God Bless. I have enough trouble with my son '.,1
He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. I highly recommend this.,1
"Or simply, something that will make you think.",1
"As a result, the acting is understated and implicit, as opposed to overt and explicit. Angelopoulos'genius through Arvanitis'camera is on display throughout the film.",1
The problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand. Truth be told he's kind of sweet on Myrna and Cary knows it.,1
"( Hence the spoiler. ) Due to the overall photographic style, large screen viewing is recommended.",1
"However, I'd be hard - pressed to name a better substitute than Jean Arthur. Of course, let's not lie.",1
"It seems that Powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed. It still works well, and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own. I suspect the writer had something else in mind - say, the wacky side of Carole Lombard. And this isn't the first time she's done that!",1
Jean Arthur SHINES when she looks at Powell. There seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks! My friends thought the same.,1
This is after he comes to Bill Powell for help. They succeeded to some degree.,1
Eric Blore also has some comic turns as Powell's butler.,1
Good but not great. < br / > < br / > I give this movie a B +.,1
!,1
Meng Lo plays yet another bad ass.,1
I was really bummed.,1
"But the plot I heard was so great, was so predictable. In short, not much happens. Wrong.",1
Then the movie began.,1
It lost NONE of it's original kung fu coolness! ! < br / > < br / > Watch it soon!,1
< br / > < br / > The story is very interesting. It doesn't get any better than this. I really like this movie.,1
"See this one at all costs. Heck, my wife even enjoyed it. The story is well told, and complete.",1
This film is breath of fresh air in comparison.,1
< br / > < br / > Around 7 out of 10. We're given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is. < br / > < br / > Classic martial arts film has title that even many non - fans know.,1
"), this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work. As for television : forget it. $. In its own right as fascinating as any other genre - based whodunit ( western, cop show, etc.",1
"With television looming on the horizon, Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time. But, Blandings asks himself every few minutes, how long is long? < br / > < br / > This movie is a delight. You decide.",1
"So what makes this movie so special? The formula proved so popular The twist is that since the clan always wears masks, not all of them known who the others are. ).",1
< br / > < br / > One movie you must watch if you are a kung - fu movie fan. It's known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story.,1
While most martial arts films deal with revenge Chang did not use that as a central theme.,1
"Each character has different traits, characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. It's worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that'going on. Once you get yer mitts on it, it'll change the way you look at kung - fu flicks. One is the Centipede, two is the Snake, three is the Scorpion, four is the Lizard, and five is the Toad. We learn along with him.",1
!,1
"But stick with it, and you won't be disappointed! Well, I must say that this was one hell of a fun movie.",1
"8 out of 10 on the scale. This movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into vibe. It somehow leaves you wanting something, you want more.",1
< br / > < br / > Poison Clan rocks!,1
We actually care when people are killed in this film.,1
"However, the rest of cast is extremely sub - par in comparison.",1
So disgusting.,1
The Sarah Silverman program.,1
Best show since Seinfeld.,1
"Give it a shot. Personally I love the program, but there are some huge faults with it. it is nothing like those shows.",1
Every time she speaks it's like a self - contained 5 second skit.,1
"I got it, but wasn't laughing very much. When I first saw this show, I thought it looked interesting. Then I got to see her movie, Jesus is Magic.",1
The best kind of comedy around.,1
Who plays Sarah's sister? The cast is awesome.,1
I'm a happy guy. Completely outrageous.,1
"< br / > < br / > Then, came the second season. I shall explain. Sarah can come at you from odd angles. - That is funny stuff in my book. he asks. """,1
< br / > < br / > What I also love is that not everything is a punchline. You just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it.,1
This show probably won't appeal to everyone. com.,1
This show is finally something new and interesting and ( most importantly ) funny! I can't say that about many TV shows... can you?,1
At least we have Grey Gardens to remember them!,1
This film was done after that rescue. It is certainly a strange one - like rubbernecking at a highway accident. How can you improve on this?,1
The outfits Edie comes up with a very clever and creative. DVD and VHS. Hmmm... Then I got to looking at their body of work. Grey Gardens sounded very interesting. Worrying too much about things. It is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out.,1
).,1
"They cannot help being one singer, the other the dancer.",1
"Even though their house was filthy, this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness. Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for. Let me take care of you! """,1
Grey Gardens is a world unto itself.,1
Two thumbs way up!,1
The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre.,1
"It did, but it also prompted me to rent the movie.",1
< br / > < br / > Love it.,1
Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. The content is pretty much made up of two things. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.,1
It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. Unforgettable.,1
See this one.,1
"Remember me? """,1
I saw this film in the 1980's on British television. This is why i so love this website!,1
(! ),1
"It is rare experience that you must see for yourself. And their lives an example of drive, determination and free - will.",1
"And of course there are numerous cats running around. The older Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the younger is her first cousin. Her mother seems more resigned to her fate, to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions. < br / > < br / > At its heart, this documentary is incredibly sad.",1
"But other than that, the movie's a hoot. The builders, contractors, and others also provide their fair share of laughs.",1
"I saw this film a couple of weeks ago, and it's been stuck in my head ever since. The sound, even on the Criterion re - release is poor and difficult to follow. They were living in dangerous, unhealthy, unsafe conditions. It's shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire Bouvier family.",1
< br / > < br / > What a strange film. It won ' and who knows what else.,1
Little Edie is even more interesting.,1
The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle. < br / > < br / > The answer is : Probably not. Ice cream spread on crackers.,1
This is also no B movie.,1
"Don't read anything about this movie ( especially nothing that could contain any spoilers ). Sorry, can't tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience. Just give it a chance.",1
"I was also very impressed with Jeremy Northam. Cypher "" is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in America in the not too distant future. Lucy Liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak - and - dagger tone.",1
"Or was it? In real life, too, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, a Democrat, and a feminist. Jason Robards,r., has a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable. Politics in the movie?",1
"Cypher is a clever, effective and eerie film that delivers.",1
"< br / > < br / > Take it from there. It's sedate because that's what the Main Character is. But they all fit, and they entertain.",1
This is my first comment! How wrong.,1
I don't recommend that to anyone. And Jeremy Northam.,1
Walt D in LV WOW.,1
"Jeremy Even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60's film, with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless. Sunways, on the other hand, constantly tries to unmask the Digisoft - rats and recruit them again as double - spies. Cypher "" is a pretty inventive Sci - Fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright & claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible.",1
The twist is so much fun! Wow! How will Morgan get himself out of this? Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster ( played by Lucy Liu )? What a nifty movie!,1
"00 a year, which was like making $ 90, 000. - he feels they should seek something better. The latter was about building your dream house - in the late 1980s.",1
This is pure psychology.,1
"It is so refreshing in this day and age to see a SF film that has more than one idea in it's head. And I'm not saying anything more about the plot. Cypher is such a film. Covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese. To his bewilderment, they are unbelievably boring.",1
"Morgan, along with his fellow conference attendees, is being brainwashed. Morgan plays along, and applies for a job at rival business Sunways.",1
"Nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction. Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made. The future is now. Cypher is not, I repeat not, a B movie. Naturally, I won't give anything away. I cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is. Don't listen to the haters. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Hands down and hats off. This is not a spoiler.",1
"The conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies. It also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife. The film is superbly shot, I love the cinematography in this, it feels fresh and original. he takes an instant attraction to.",1
"The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and appropriately driving at times. No matter the brainwashing, love has a way of persevering.",1
"I think she's pretty underrated as a serious talent. He's suave and cultured. However, as he changes throughout the film, it's like night and day. Still, it did.",1
He's hoping to find the simple life. Loy is a always a joy to watch. The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are near perfect. Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role. He is so good at playing the put upon husband.,1
< br / > < br > Highly recommended. But to say Cypher is a clone would be to its discredit.,1
"O'Brien's methods prove sound during a bombing raid over Tokyo. O'Brien and Scott argue over teaching methods, while their students vie for the affections of Anne Shirley. < br / > < br / > Anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film, please contact me at : iamaseal2 @ yahoo.",1
< br / > < br / > Admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. I guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three.,1
"That it, perhaps, except for the very end - - where the film is a bit over - the - top but also VERY satisfying.",1
Action is good! Music the film is spectacular.,1
"Good action show, but nothing new.",1
Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes. Sill a good movie though........ I know this was not Stallone's fault.,1
"They dig down hundreds of feet, but never find water. So don't watch this movie through the social lens of 2003, and you'll enjoy it all more. ).",1
1 Surround Sound. Walker must outwit Quaien for survival. ( * * * * / * * * * * ). This is one of Harlin'best film.,1
All in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. Stallone even managed to get out - acted by a horse!,1
But to compare Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a far - fetched notion.,1
For the sake of the film though I willing to suspend my disbelief. The deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable. The pacing of the movie was a little slow but good outweighs the bad in this one. If you're a big fan of Harlins or Stallone's than chances are you'll enjoy this one too.,1
"A video - game? Nothing. Even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb ( "" tango - tango "" ). After landing, our master - criminals seek for a guide and end up with Stallone and Rooker. This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell. Oh, yes : and the unintentional humour. A film that entertains through some suspense, good action - sequences, and a nice snowy mountainous setting. The entire action is one big absurdity, but it's mindless fun at its best.",1
"And it'particularly good in this movie. THis guy knows about action. The more I see it, the more I like it. Big Mistake! Die Hard 2, The long kiss good bye, etc.",1
"At least, that's what the rangers believe. 5 / 10.",1
"In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very funny movie visibly inspired this delightful classic, "" The Money Pit "". 00 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to the lack of space. Jim works in an advertising agency raising US $ 15, 000. < br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) : "" Lar, Meu Tormento "" ( "" Home, My Torment "" ) My vote is eight.",1
"So far as I know, no one was killed in the making of this movie ( a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts ), so obviously a dummy was used for the shot. Cliffhanger is "" Die Hard on a mountain, "" and pretty good, for what it is.",1
A showcase of great scenes and stunts.,1
Is this journal the secret to their escape? Quite a bit of respect earned back by Valette. 5 / 10.,1
A prison cell. 9 out of 10.,1
The horror you create in your own mind. What would my personal horror be? I was hooked from beginning to end. It's the opposite.,1
Achieving true comedic dialog is an art.,1
"Carrère loves his child, and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail.",1
My vote is seven.,1
Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint. I just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale.,1
"We're inside a ramshackle French prison cell with four occupants. Good horror movies from France are quite rare, and it's fairly easy to see why! The film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters.",1
"After a short while in the cell together, they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal. French horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as Inside and Switchblade Romance bursting on to the scene.",1
It has a real life ring to it.,1
"More than anything, this is a film about being trapped, either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding. """,1
an ad for a house.,1
"Despite its obvious lack of budget, he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original, fresh and very attractive.",1
"Remember, Zone 1 or 4 are OK with my TV set!",1
They all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine. I was hooked. ).,1
But wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it. We absolutely adored it.,1
Just like Richard Barrat.,1
"What if Tremayne had learned of the Champions'powers? We never found out, alas.",1
By far it was my favorite.,1
"( And who better to play the psycho than Ally Sheedy? ) To what end, we are not aware... except for maybe the fact that she is psycho.",1
"When he sees an ad for Connecticut living, he decides to take a look. The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but doesn't have much to do. The worst one is the lack of closet space!",1
AND 2.,1
"Needless to say, I'm a big fan and Revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why. Twice.",1
2,1
THE VERY BEST EVER.,1
"it's all very simple. 10 / 10, no doubt.",1
I absolutely loved this film and i can't wait to see it again.,1
Maybe they found Ray Liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary?,1
"However, this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time. I think it's fantastic, and that Guy Ritchie is a director on top of his game.",1
"The fact is it wasn't what anyone was expecting, especially from Guy Ritchie. etc, but this is far more mature than his previous works.",1
"That was cool. The script was extremely well done, and the soundtrack, as with most Guy Ritchie films, was great.",1
A superb movie!,1
And that'my 2 cents. First time.,1
This is Altman at his classic best.,1
They don't expect him to explore new frontiers. So this movie toys with your head. It's very cleverly written.,1
< br / > < br / > Take scene where Jason Statham's character runs afoul of a car.,1
and shown regularly.,1
No luck.,1
"It was a good movie... Oh man. It follows a cute little fox family around. I saw this movie when I was little - It was called "" Glacier Fox "".",1
"He fights off this invading male, to win her love. She unknowingly walks into a foot trap. I was moved to tears.",1
Maybe it's me. But pretty inimitable.,1
"As an added bonus, both Vanity and Preston take their clothes off. The tight'n'twisty plot keeps viewers on their toes throughout.",1
There's always got to be more though hasn't there? ).,1
A guilty pleasure to say the least.,1
"You will enjoy it, that's promise. Recommended A +. Don't look at the rate of this film.",1
"Spoilers! character Leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme. Then there's Robert Trebor's ( nice name, by the way! )",1
Brendan Filone is best.,1
Whatever. Run - don't walk - and get it.,1
"There is real skill here. Why is that? Honestly, I had no real problems with this film.",1
Boca : 4.,1
Acting - Nothing short of superb. There is no department that this show doesn't excel in. Let me tell u something. Then we have The Sopranos.,1
"Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles. "" Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks.",1
"If you followed the whole thing, you know how it ends.",1
"< br / > < br / > Colorful characters dominate this series, which doesn't hold back on the sex and graphic violence. Tony's sister Janice, meanwhile, is searching for money in her mother's house with a stethoscope and a Geiger counter. The church frowns on divorce, "" she tells one woman contemplating a split. "" Yeah, it sounds like his mother. Let the Pope live with him, "" is the response.",1
"< br / > < br / > Edie Falco matches the power of Gandolfini's performance as Tony's wife Carmela. < br / > < br / > James Gandolfini domineers the show as Tony, one of the most groundbreaking characters on TV ever.",1
"), Joe Pantoliano ( great! When The Sopranos hits the mark, it really hits the mark.",1
< br / > < br / > Every character represents a facet of American industry.,1
Just my opinion.,1
"Most of the writers and actors are Italian - American, would they attack themselves? In both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes ).",1
It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems. 3.,1
"A sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles. She is simply put, his savior.",1
Brendan Filone is # 1 for me.,1
"The first two seasons were extraordinary. And it's not just him. """,1
"All things considered I could make an elaborate statement on the series, but I won't.",1
"Every little detail builds the perfect TV series. All acting is powerful and characters complex, but the two who stand out the most are ; James Gandolfini who'is'Tony Soprano. Also Michael Imperioli who plays Christopher, representing the younger ( 20 - 30 ) generation in crime.",1
Wow. A tip of the pork pie to Mr. Chase. Anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know Tony. The best TV ever.,1
These guys were definitely best of their generations and even more.,1
That's why I watch.,1
It's perfect!,1
< br / > < br / > Simply exceptional. Yes.,1
"This show is also very versatile. Right here. For me, it's a show about family.",1
The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history. The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous. Forget Family Redifined.,1
"Of course, at that time X meant Maturity. < br / > < br / > I want to make some comments about the movie itself. Once again, Joe is conned and before long is homeless.",1
It is like a trip through humanity.,1
"< br / > < br / > Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, called "" Ratso "" by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time. I didn't at all think of it this way, but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title "" Midnight Cowboy "" was a gay porno. You don't have to steal it. """,1
"BUT SO WHAT! No, it is not high art by any means. ). This is a great example of a good, dumb movie. < br / > < br / > What can you say about Jon De Bello?",1
< br / > < br / > Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself.,1
"Otherwise he may have been typecast after the Graduate. I think Voight captured the naivete and the viciousness - when - provoked. Anyway, this considered an all - time great for a reason.",1
"Instead, it shows you the rough side of lifestyle of hustling. However, the film doesn't try to guilt trip you. They become thieves. Their story is devastating to watch, but is ultimately important for people to see. Joe is shook up by a haunting childhood. This is one of the greatest films ever made.",1
I'm all for that! Who is to judge? I didn't : that's because it's so real to me.,1
Check it out.,1
The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece.,1
"As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines.",1
Midnight Cowboy is not for everybody.,1
"< br / > < br / > But even in this final quest, two are losers.",1
"Though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent, Ratso is just as naïve as Joe.",1
< br / > < br / > The film became famous and infamous almost overnight.,1
Just kidding.,1
Must have been'70 when I saw it.,1
"His subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out. He is singing a cowboy song, the very thing he strives to be.",1
"WestSide Story had dealt with Racism by a love feast in an artistic view. Thence, "" Midnight "" gives the factual sight. Besides Ratso helps Joe to find his way to do whatever he can. They begin sharing everything in life.",1
"The two become dependent on one another, and Rizzo begins to manage Joe.",1
The editing in this movie is great.,1
We know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this.,1
Nina Simone comes to mind. ( Hi Skip. At the time I recall being quite startled and amused by this movie.,1
"I sort of feel this way about "" Easy Rider. "" that aren't important. < br / > < br / > Other than that, "" Midnight ( Although it, too, is one of my favorites. )",1
At the time ( And even now ) it was definitely not a typical movie ( quite art - house ). Surprisingly it was only rated M15 + ( the uncut version ). At a time when the cinema What makes the film interesting is two characters are so different.,1
I recommend this film to everyone.,1
I'm giving it a 10. < br / > < br / > A great film - - - but very dark.,1
"But this one I can live with. when other comics clearly should've beaten them out. Then one will be determined as "" Last Comic Standing. """,1
This is where imagination wins out over fact. Horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn't always win out over imagination.,1
The great John Cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town.,1
Perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline.,1
This is a very funny movie!,1
It all creates a very vivid picture of a life that's long gone.,1
"A minor but admirable little film. Exploding cigars provide a running gag. """,1
Brodie's legendary ( did he do it? - it's still a cause of argument!,1
The very first shot might be startling.,1
it still in a general area wasn't that good. don't expect something from a movie that it isn't.,1
"Like I said, sometimes dead is better!",1
! The acting is also great and i love the cast.,1
"This one, has a lot of them.",1
"Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. Non Horror fans will want to avoid this. Soon enough, Ellie Creed's cat, Church, is found dead.",1
( out of 10 ) Fred Gwynne is WONDERFUL.,1
Nowadays I´m kind of hooked to this film. It´s like an appetizer for a good party!,1
"And the results are horrifying. Despite warning, or even past history. < br / > < br / > Maybe. Maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath? I disagree.",1
7,1
"First, it's a scary Horror movie. But that's just my opinion. Second, it's an emotional, clever movie overall. Could Pascow prevent this tragedy? "" You won't regret.",1
"Patti Smith is missing in action, but not Sandra.",1
"Pet Sematary "" is an adaptation from the Stephen King novel of the same title. There are a few plot holes here and there, nothing major though.",1
"Many strange things starts to happen and Church, Ellie's cat, dies while walking on the highway. Soon, they met their new neighbor, and old man named Judd Crandall.",1
!,1
And applause goes to whomever did the make - up on Andrew Hubatsek.,1
It goes along with movie wonderfully.,1
"That burial ground is pure evil. That character is "" Zelda. "" 10 out of 10.",1
What's not to like? < br / > < br / > A couple of the scenes are funny. Give Pia a break. But its a trashy movie.,1
What more could you ask for?,1
"Bob is persuaded to go "" one round "" with Jack. < br / > < br / > The film is loaded with symbolism.",1
"Tune in and see. Later, Jack improves so much that he, too, becomes a legitimate boxer. Is he good enough?",1
But can boxers have such dimples?,1
Nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols.,1
The scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone. Sandra tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of American pop culture to an audience that doesn't completely see it.,1
< br / > < br / > This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest.,1
"The final match, as a result, ends up being somewhat anticlimactic. Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock.",1
"At first glance, it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity - themed morality comedies of Cecil B. De Mille, but more than that it is the first really competent Hitchcock picture. < br / > < br / > Let's make a few honourable mentions for aforementioned actors.",1
Wonderful.,1
< br / > < br / > That was fifty years ago.,1
Not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994. But this Shallow Grave is a worthy addition to the 80's backwoods slasher.,1
"They dressed in clothes and had many amenities. One day, she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control?",1
Rene Russo plays her role wonderfully feminine.,1
"Now, how is he going to get out of it? And that is what happens.",1
Courageous? I thought so - to a point where it sent shivers up my spine.,1
My heart goes out to them. I am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain.,1
< br / > < br / > The ending COULD have been fantastic. I actually found it to be somewhat decent. The story is extremely unique.,1
"I doubt that scene was meant to be funny, but cracked me up.",1
This anime is a must - see for fans of Evangelion.,1
"A couple more characters are introduced, and parts of Noriko's past are dragged up again. In short, time moves slower for those who travel at speed of light.",1
Here's a real weirdo for you.,1
"However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. It is because of her father's death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. Aim For The Top! I totally loved this series, and to this day, it remains my favorite anime.",1
"! Adds conviction, I'll say that. He makes love, convincingly as well. Great actor, just coming into his own.",1
"We watch, we return, and we thank them. Yes, some of the dialogue is hokey. Why? The graphics are first rate.",1
"Hidden Frontier has gone where few tread to go in the world of science fiction, and thrived once they got there. The large ensemble cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. I highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch.",1
This is short and to the point.,1
I recommend any Trek fan to check out Countermeasures and you will be hooked!,1
"< br / > < br / > The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved. It portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way, dealing with them subtly and smoothly. The cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on - screen. HF will live for a long time after it ends, as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place.",1
Do not read if you have not watched series up to this point!,1
"Cole ) < br / > < br / > The gay material is layed on too thick ( Graham Norton'd be embarrassed ). Fab to see James Cawley in the latest episode "" Vigil "" Check it out! ( Well, I'm guessing Rene hails from the Czech Rep. ) < br / > < br / > It gets my vote, and the CGI is kewl. ENOUGH already! Trek doesn't pay that much attention to hetero couples so why signpost gays with all the snogging? < br / > < br / > Really glad I found it!",1
"For the record, I am not affiliated with the production in any way. Over 7 seasons ( this is the last ) they have produced some 50 or so episodes.",1
This doesn't take away from the overall experience however.,1
"Hidden Frontier is a fan made show, in the world of Star Trek. All in all I enjoyed watching it.",1
One of Hidden Frontier's greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced.,1
"One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three stay by the car. I really enjoyed this one, and although the ending made me angry, I still give it 10 out of 10.",1
xx It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. This rates second best to Quadrophenia ( which also starred Phil Daniels ). God Bless you all.,1
Please if you get the chance watch this movie you won't be sorry!,1
!,1
"< br / > < br / > If you get a chance to, see it.",1
Very well done though. Peter Egan as the lead Magnus Pym is excellent. He has no real love or loyalty in him.,1
"In later years it is his son who has to bail him out, again and again. Everyone's happy, as long as the flow of faked information continues!",1
< br / > < br / > Surronding Egan is a fantastic supporting cast.,1
"Violence, torture, cruelty are always just beneath the surface. < br / > < br / > Another theme is that of malignancy. and never, "" Do you love me? "" I like it still. Throughout the story he betrays and is betrayed.",1
So much so that I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming. < br / > < br / > Jane Booker is annoying as Mary Pym.,1
love.,1
"Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed to perfection.",1
"Spoilers! Whenever she was on screen, I became transfixed.",1
"Iphigenia, however, is a highlight. Strongly recommended for fans of international cinema.",1
"7 / 10 Worth a look to exploit fans - others may find it a little too dull for their liking. Some pretty hot women in this one, would have benefited from some more explicit sex, but I guess ya can't have it all.",1
But after seeing it I realized what a funny man he is.,1
"Was it a documentary, was it a comedy routine..... Well, it was BOTH. But it quickly sucked me in.",1
Just look at Jane's nude swim.,1
"What a wonderful, wonderful story.",1
This is a great film.,1
Well. Forever. Stupid? She could be smart. Jane dominates. A punishment for being vane perhaps? Some cheap drama.,1
Just wow. Bonnie & Clyde kill two highway patrolman in Texas. She's totally got him trained. I got a huge kick out of this movie.,1
"Of course, Tarzan isn't deadonly wounded ; after being nursed back to health by Cheetah (! ).",1
Its an amazing thing.,1
"Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy. Nope. Once it's explained, he's cool. She and Tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter. So they've not only been having sex, they've been having kinky sex! She stretches sensuously, and with a coquettish look she says "" Tarzan, you've been a bad boy! """,1
WELL worth seeing but not for kids!,1
What camera! It is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant. He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her.,1
"The effect of the lighting, the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual. Tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals, in scenes that look like a humanized King King. This is an outdoor adventure filmed on the MGM back - lot which really works. But they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions.",1
"The crisp display of later Tarzan films is lacking here. Later she admits to Tarzan that she was wrong. Compare, for example, in Tarzan Finds a Son!",1
"The movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him. The characters dare to ask questions like : What if something happened to Tarzan? Tarzan still speaks very broken English, but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate.",1
When I was a kid it was Lex Barker's time as Tarzan. < br / > < br / > Good for Jane and her mate!,1
"Like Tarzan the Ape Man ( 1932 ), only more so. No wonder they're happy.",1
And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality. < br / > < br / > The skin show in this film is off the charts.,1
"With her pair of "" lungs, "" that was no problem. Up to finale, it was not overdone, either.",1
"She did do The release of TARZAN THE APE MAN, in 1932, caused a sensation.",1
Thank you.,1
The waiting for word.,1
I hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy. My memory of it was correct : it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch.,1
"Our food was also first rate = prime rib at lunch, etc. for one or two weeks.",1
"They are a very, very far cry from Lana Turner and John Garfield in the Hollywood version. This is pretty silly and totally unrealistic. This movie is a ripoff of James Cain's novel, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE. Despite this, the movie isn't really just an Italian version of the Hollywood movie.",1
This is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization. It does not have low - key lighting and unconventional camera angles. < br / > < br / > Ossessione is not as noirish as The Postman Always Rings Twice. Its also a lot more sexual than the Lana Turner version.,1
"Still, it makes for an He wants the pair of them to run away together, but she's not so keen on the idea.",1
< br / > < br / > The film was shot on location at Aulis. Kazakos and Papas embody the sublimity of the classical Greece tragedy. The harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters.,1
Four stars ( highest rating ).,1
It relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light. To say the least it was probably a bit alarming.,1
"It's simply a greatly made one, based on some equally great and strong source material. < br / > < br / > Nevertheless, I don't really have much else negative to say about this movie. Oh, those sneaky Italians. The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.",1
Can one build love upon murder?,1
"< br / > < br / > But in contrast to Giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level. The very taking over of Bragana's place, which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man, causes a deep loathing of himself. Being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold - blooded killer. In her hands Gino degenerates into a self - sacrificing tool.",1
"Highly recommended. Excellent direction, script, acting, and cinematography.",1
Cacoyannis achieved the impossible. !,1
"Neo - realism, by the way, could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather ( along with De Sica's The Children Are Watching Us ), which that would take shape after the war. I didn't know what to expect Visconti to do in his approach to the material, after seeing La Terra Trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit. I think I've just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along, even as I was in fear of the futures of the two leads.",1
After this rest is manual labor and we don't anticipate finishing before early spring.,1
My vote is ten. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way.,1
"Yes, i'm being superlative, but Ossessione was just that terrific. Wow! The most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema!",1
Luchino Visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries. < br / > < br / > The film has been well preserved in the DVD format we watched recently.,1
"They immediately start a heated, passionate, yet volatile love affair.",1
Their relationship quickly crumbles. Gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea.,1
!,1
Don't expect Oscar quality.,1
""".",1
It was fantastic.,1
"The pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on. Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by a h - game. I was at a lost for words "".",1
I have to agree with everyone else that has posted.,1
"I had to see this show, and that is what I really did. He does have cool character.",1
< br / > < br / > I give this series a 10 / 10.,1

!,1
"Footsteps. He has to make things right. His "" look "" changes as his obsession grows. A good Indie ending.",1
"The filmmakers undoubtedly had little money, but this constraint is used to the film's advantage. If you are more concerned with plot, this film and its ending may frustrate you.",1
I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies. Also - a really cool zombie twist which I thought was VERY ORIGINAL.,1
"Anyway, what can I say, I love this film.",1
I highly recommend catching this film.,1
This is NOT a horror flick.,1
Or could the creature be real?,1
"You like me! """,1
Jake is so convinced that one is out to get him and his family he begins to hatch a plan of action to protect them before it's too late.,1

It was on right after Bay City Rollers. But kids love this stuff.,1
"cherryred. "".",1
Let's all go to Living Island where there is friendship and fun! This movie is not limited to children either. The music in this movie suited Jack Wild and Mama Cass beautifully.,1
It wasn't weird to me. I can still remember characters vividly. Pufnstuf rocks!!!! I cried every time I watched it. I loved Jack Wilde. ).,1
Otherwise it would be a perfect 10.,1
This is a fascinating account of the hunt for the Soviet Union's first known serial killer.,1
"Why did two kids, who knew better, stone to death a toddler they kidnapped? < br / > < br / > CitizenX may also argue against (! )",1

"The locations and sets are perfect recreations of latter day Soviet life. < br / > < br / > The cast is outstanding. He is driven to find and stop the killer. "" His only tools are his dedication, skill and honesty.",1
Jeffrey DeMunn as the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo.,1
His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable.,1
A masterpiece of genre.,1
The devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by Rea. Rent or buy this movie today!,1
"You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who labored in that system. Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn, and von Sydow ( in a small role ) are all brilliant in their performances.",1
"Yes, shoddy lab - work set him free to continue killing for years. It is easy to follow and has just enough truth behind its version of events to make for compelling viewing. < br / > < br / > It doesn't hurt that director and co - writer Chris Gerolmo has a pitch perfect cast.",1
"However, they have a common cause to catch the serial killer. Excellent script.",1
"Rea does so much with his face, his eyes, he doesn't need to overact. He followed case to its conclusion, 3 years later. Upon seeing it again, I'm always reminded of how good it is.",1
It is in my Top 10 Must see list.,1
It's obvious within the first 10 minutes of CITIZEN X whodunnit.,1
"I spent a large part of my working life in cinema, without being an actor. But hardly anyone has done it so well.",1
< br / > < br / > This is a quality film. Brilliant.,1
This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work.,1
There are only two short action scenes but they are horrific. Jeffrey DeMunn is downright scary as the killer.,1
"He is the objective. Well, too bad.",1
Not overly done either.,1
"HBO has hit the jackpot here. He is tortured, ashamed, but vicious as well.",1
"He is tortured, ashamed, as well as extremely vicious.",1
"Wow! Why wasn't it released to a wider audience? There is no way to spoil the ending ; who the killer is is never kept from the audience. What a brilliant film. By committing these horrendous acts, he gets to feel strong, powerful. This was fascinating, albeit morbid, reading.",1
"Of course, no one wants to go near the castle. Baron Dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay.",1
TV Soap Actors. Those eyes! Great.,1
Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take or leave.,1
"It wasn't because Hollywood was against art or creativity. < br / > < br / > And what better director for this project than Minnelli, himself a painter and a pianist? What makes for Best Picture material? The words don't fit the plot, but the routines fit the show.",1
< br / > < br / > A 7.,1
"Not that it makes the movie drag in any parts, it just makes it a bit overlong.",1
"When she got the call to audition, she said, "" Who's Gene Kelly? "" The film was inspired by the 1928 orchestral composition by George Gershwin.",1
Very good!,1
"A talented dancer, she was never a real beauty. < br / > < br / > I also found Nina Foch's character Milo to be rather irritating.",1
"I'm sorry, Leslie Caron bothers me. Musn't forget the beiges as well. The story and music ( George Gershwin! )",1
"He is definately one of the all time greats. Some purely majestic, others pure corn. Ingenious!",1
Uggh!,1
"Meanwhile Gene Kelly falls for lovely damsel, Leslie Caron. 8 / 10 Famous French singer Georges Guietary sings, too.",1
A must see!,1
He is so talented. It is enchanting. I enjoyed this film.,1
"Worth the watch! And Leslie Caron can't really, um, you know... act. It's stunningly filmed, and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully.",1
"And it has quite a bit of satire there to. This is soooo funny!! ). Sadly Elisabeth Shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part. Sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top, but 90 % of the time she is a riot!",1
""". You want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies.",1
The two films are actually closely linked.,1
But see!,1
Caron also has musical comedy star Georges Guetary interested in here. < br / > < br / > Two women are interested in him.,1
"Indeed, the singing is grand and compelling. Parsifal journeys into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film. Kundry is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt Mary Magdalene or Eve from Genesis ( played by Edith Clever but beautifully sung by mezzo - soprano Yvonne Minton ). The tempting Flower Maidens are in the nude. Syberberg is known for controversial films.",1
"( See footnote with spoiler at the end of this review. ) This very peculiar setting of Wagner's last opera definitely grew on me. < br / > < br / > Personally, I never really understood the role of Kundry until I saw how Edith Clever portrayed her.",1
"Hermann Levi, who was his favorite conductor! For example : notorious dual Parsifals ( of each gender! ( Go figure! ) naturally entrusted the premiere to an unconverted ( not for want of RW's trying! ) < br / > < br / > Syberberg, too, seems politically ambiguous from what I've read.",1
"Used car salesmen and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious targets! While the mystery itself is rarely that terrific, because of the breezy writing and acting, the films really satisfy. ! Etienne Girardot is just a character actor - - the sort of person people almost never would know by name. I've already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air.",1
Sally Field and Kevin Kline are beyond fabulous. I have been a fan of this movie for years and years.,1
< br / > < br / > Nicely done and passes time in an entertaining manner. Must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film.,1
< br / > < br / > I will say this though. S. S. Van Dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.,1
"Never mind, each of them are good in their own way. A warm family film to enjoy.",1
Bravo.,1

"The struggles are mental, emotional and subtle.",1

"I'm biased, I'm in love with her.",1
It is a beautifully filmed human story. That is all.,1
The final few scenes are powerful but depressing.,1
"None of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place. It was, if nothing else, not a predictable film.",1
There are no words needed. < br / > < br / > I think I would like to visit this Africa.,1
Because there is no real story here.,1
!,1
I was also struck with the love / hate relationship between him and Aimee. It is this cynical side of the story that ties it to Coup de Torchon. In reflecting on this movie I can think of two others to help put it in perspective. He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother.,1
"It does bear a superficial similarity to OUT OF Africa, but without all the romantic fluff. This is an amazing film to watch or show young people. < br / > < ). The Whites are all the bosses and they expect Black servitude without question.",1
"Quotes like "" Sudden speech! So 10 it is. ( which I really like, BTW ).",1
The film is told from the perspective of an adult returning to her childhood home in a foreign country. < br / > < br / > The household is divided into public and private spaces.,1

this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect. it has no boundaries as far as age goes.,1

"Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works don't really last, except as photos or films of what they were.",1
"Working with his teeth and bare hands, Goldsworthy crafts a beautiful, ephemeral work.",1
The music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating.,1
He makes art from objects he finds in nature. But do go if you have the opportunity.,1
"Indeed, time and change is what his work is fundamentally about.",1
"< br / > < br / > At another point he remarks on "" What is here to stay... and what isn't. "" That is his theme. < br / > < br / > Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy's work is in this sort of expression.",1
I beg to differ. It is his lifeforce.,1
"The process of creation and destruction. < br / > < br / > And that's precisely what he's all about : Time. Of emergence and disappearing. There's a shamanic quality about him, verging on madness.",1
This is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change.,1
I can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie. I can still take it how I want to even if I know what it was meant to do.,1

It's not like they want to kill people for attention. You get to know these two shooters, unlike "" Elephant. """,1

This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines.,1
I like the end a lot. And of course it is all about the Magician theme. This movie is awesome for three main reasons. Sometimes they fall into clichés but this one does not.,1
Quite a visual. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs. Carter.,1
What an actor!,1

"Highly recommended. There's enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans, and enough T & A from couple of the girls to please T & A fans.",1
i'll give it 7 / 10.,1
Well what did you expect? Before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve. Looking through the credits I noticed numerous'Crains'listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature.,1
"It's a place where men can be boys. < br / > < br / > Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy in comparison to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? But there's a lot to be said for the source.

"Here, all she has to do is scream "" I HATE YOU I HATE YOU YOU CREEP! "" This has to be, hands down, hats off, one of the most uproarious comedies ever made. Now THAT is only in the first few minutes. Yes, Cathy Moriarty is a very gifted actress, and one hell of a comedienne.",1
"5 STARS! These men have great jobs though. Well, what can you say?",1
"The first time I saw this, I didn't laugh too much. 7 out of 10.",1
This film really works. It is hard to imagine Simon ever topping this. This had been done in some forms previously.,1
"On the other Madison figures the best way to help Ungar is to let him move in with him until his suicidal tendencies wear off. Are they comedies with dramatic undertones, or dramas with a lot of humor? < br / > < br / > Unfortunately for Madison, he doesn't know what he's getting himself into.",1
"Jack makes a very, very, honest effort at the role. What's the brown? "" The original movie, The Odd Couple, has some wonderful comic one - liners.",1
"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedic performances. Now 40 years old, it has lost none of it's power.",1

"Still, there are many worse ways to kill a couple hours.",1
"Funny, funny, funny.",1
"Matthau is in especially good form as Oscar, the slob. The script is good... definitely Neil Simon's best. Lots of fun and some great one - liner.",1
"Here's another film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation. It's Neil Simon's humorous material that's key, and where the laughs really originate from.",1
"Great stuff. And all in one scene. The girls love his sensitivity, his ability to cry in front of them. Think again. You get a real sense of the "" Goodbye, "" he answers back. He's blowing it, right? He's in like Flynn, right?",1
"< br / > < br / > Calling to mind Billy Wilder's screenplay for'The Apartment ( 1960 ),'this Neil Simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise. ).",1

So there you have it.,1
"He could be the healthiest one in the room! "".",1

< br / > < br / > It's a excellent thriller.,1
It was incredible. I won't give anything away. Then we move on to where Jack is chasing Lisa in the airport. Wes Craven is definitely The Master of Suspense.,1
That says a lot.,1

"Most of the film takes place on a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces.",1

Wes Craven did well with this film. and they sort of become friends.,1

There are things worse than Vikings out there. Aidan has special plans for Brendan. This is one of them.,1
"THE SECRET OF KELLS is an astonishing first animated feature which will dazzle your eye and move your heart. The characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original Book of Kells. The Abbot disregards the value of Brendan's art in his quest for security. Of course, historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor This is the movie's outer conflict. Historically this was in the late 8th century, when the centers of Irish learning were over - run by the Vikings.",1
"The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting. < br / > < br / > Try to catch this quiet gem of a film. OK, the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting. I would have liked to know more about the Book that Brendan and Aiden was working on. One day, Aiden, the renowned illustrator from Iona, sought refuge with them.",1
The groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal.,1
"The cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as I'd feared. May there be many more. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well realised, a mix of fact and fantasy.",1

"The photography and the compositions are excellent. Tessari does not waste a second in this 90 - minute shoot'em up. Ostensibly, "" Big Guns "" is a rather bloodless outing, but it does have a high body count for a 1973 mobster melodrama.",1

Don't read plot! Go see it because it is a good movie!,1
"Needless to mention that these two films, Tony Arzenta ( 1973 ) and Zorro, are very unlike. It comes from Delon's rather short flirting with the Italian B cinema of the'70s.",1

Of course non believers will say its only a sci - fi movie. ! That means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it.,1
Only this time... with the homeless.,1

"It was so real... so, so, real. I saw myself acting out just like her. That is not the issue here. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie.",1
"I always thought she was great and always will. But, in her case, what she did was remarkable. She has been through a lot and has faced it.",1

"The film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously. Villains like The Stooge, Shoulders, Lips, The Brow, Mumbles, the Blank, Pruneface, Spud. The Tim Burton Batmans had it, as did ( in an even more grotesque manner ) Sin City.",1
"Just picked this up on DVD and watched it again. All in all, a fun few hours. "".",1
"Good cinematography, great direction, and superbly acted.",1
"The surreal feeling really got me. 9, will you call me crazy? And many thanks to make - ups.",1
"Gleanne Headly is Tracy's tough - talking, fiercely independent long - time girlfrined. Mandy Patinkin is 88 Keys, piano player for Breathless's show. William Forsythe and Ed O'Ross are Big Boy's enforcers, Flattop and Itchy. Charles Durning is the chief of police.",1
"Madonna fans would love it! I must admit to those that haven't seen it. Creatively, this movie is amazing!",1
"Odd for a comic strip film, but hey, it works. It's a wonder to behold. < br / > < br / > Ten stars. Great Scott! ).",1
7 out of 10.,1
The list is far too long. !,1
Just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking. 7 / 10 average on IMDb. 4.,1
Check the full credits on main page and you'll amazed.,1
I did.,1
"I can't believe no better could have been done - - I refuse to. I thought I was back in junior high school. Every time one of the lame songs came on, I was turned off. The whole score was terrible...",1
Simple formula.,1
Very pretty visuals though.,1
This animated movie is a masterpiece!,1
"I thoroughly recommend it. Spirit "" was great breath of fresh air. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong. I had the same feeling.",1
The result is truly stunning.,1
"I recently watched Spirit and enjoyed it very much, I've seen it about 4 times now on HBO and will buy the DVD. This isn't prevalent through the entire movie though, and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappy. Doing so would take away from the story's power. All one has to do is look around at the dwindling open areas around us to see that. In a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the rapids and the heat from a forest fire.",1
I think you will too. The music was also fantastic.,1
"Overall, I rate it a 10 / 10 - a must watch. Spirit : Stallion of the Cimarron is an overall wonderful movie. Sometimes back then ; they did treat mustangs very poorly. < br / > < br / > The drawn animation is a special thing about many animations.",1
This is what makes the movie so goo.,1
).,1
huh? The horse is indeed a fine animal.,1
"Second the simple story, and the drama of Spirit gets your attention. I don't know, making animals talk is just so... lame.",1
8 of 10.,1
"The father figure is Charlie, a violent man with a short fuse. As one might expect, this movie suffers by comparison.",1
Not one to be missed.,1
"The acting is rather amateurish, at best.",1
"I agree with "" Jerry. """,1
The opening commercial is a very nice touch. Wow. Something of a surprise.,1
PHENOMENAL.,1
This movie has it all.,1
This is still a superb film. The chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere.,1
"Robert Loggia as Tony's patron, Frank Lopez is wonderful. Mel, without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of drug industry.",1
"Still, he won't stop at murder.",1
Crime does not pay for long! Is that powerful enough for you? Pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation.,1
The supporting cast served its job very well. Robert Loggia I have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell. < br / > < br / > The writing was great it was just pure Oliver Stone. That is a testament to him though. Scarface should be liked and loved but not in the way it has been or is.,1
"< br / > < br / > Lopez The result was ` Scarface,'starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles. And they, too, saw America as a land of opportunity, even as Al Capone had considered Chicago some fifty years earlier. But not all.",1
Arguebly Al Pacino's best role.,1
"Also, about the violence. Ya don't.",1
This is masterpiece and i recommend that you see this. 9 / 10 You will not be disappointed.,1
It is not a'gangster film '. And that is why the film works so well. 'When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons.,1
This is one of my all time favorites.,1
The laugh here is that Bronson used to play Indians. < br / > < br / > Why did Mom fail to censor these films? The Last Hunt is the forgotten Hollywood classic western.,1
He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. The soundtrack is all 80s!,1
"The darker side of the fabled "" American Dream "". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. Every great gangster movie has under - currents of human drama.",1
"< br / > < br / > Although the person who has aids is Leo the scenario wraps around the way in which Marcel ( the youngest brother of Leo ) coupes with the sickness of his relative. There is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together you can see them being real friends, concern about each other. This movie was for a while in my collection, but it wasn't before a friend of mine reminded me about it until I decided that I should watch it.",1
I was very moved by this movie.,1
"It is projected that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS. Beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about. Leo tells him that he is ill and Marcel is sad but accepting.",1
"I assume he loves her. Jules et Jim, this is not.",1
"< br / > < br / > The casting is impressive. Here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy ex - con. Pialat films people in extreme emotional situations, usually with several violent scenes.",1
"< br / > < br / > A lot of things don't make sense to me. ! Witty, clever with superb writing it was promising.",1
She wants her freedom but it comes at a cost.,1
"Except for the king, I suppose.",1
"There are only two false steps in this 1993 film. to Drosselmeyer, etc. < br / > < br / > This is deliberately a stagebound film ; in a way, it resembles Laurence Olivier's "" Othello "". The "" heavy "" dancing is left to the adults in the story. ).",1
"Nolan steals every scene he's in with the cast. By the time of the period The Last Hunt is set in, the buffalo had been all but wiped out. It's the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt. In The Last Hunt, he's racist here. He kills both buffalo and Indians for pure pleasure.",1
"He can confirm that Uncle Kessler was a war criminal, though it is all completely baffling to Leo.",1
A must see for Castle fans and horror movie fans. That aside this is just great.,1
"It also paints Castle as a larger than life character, who was very well - liked and had a smile on his face. A must see for classic horror andci - fi fans. I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. < br / > < br / > Unlike most film documentaries that mostly show testaments from film historians, SPINE TINGLER!",1
It took the audience about TEN MINUTES to calm down.,1
"This was to be his crowning achievement, though sadly the film is more often ( Joe Dante and Stuart Gordon also have sizable roles. ) His gimmicks, his cost - cutting techniques and his unique vision are legendary. Who better to control the purse of wild artist Polanski than a penny - pinching Castle? I knew nothing about her personal life, his goals and ambitions. Hoping to direct, he is sidelined to producer in order to make way for new director Roman Polanski. Such is "" Spine Tingler : The William Castle Story "".",1
( We never find out what became of the other Castle offspring. ),1
They should have stayed put.,1
Seek it out if you can find it.,1
).,1
"The real winner here, though, is god.",1
"O Sanders ) how did he to that. But how can you stand to mange a baseball team that can't win. That night Roger makes a prayer, for the angles win the championship. His mom is dead!",1
It was a miracle indeed! ! My work was good!!!!!,1
Sidekick Milton Davis Jr. delivers a tear - jerking performance as the longtime friend who never knew his parents. The quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time.,1
"In this remake they "" haunt "" the California Angels.",1
"His hair color may not convince but his performance does, a shallow and violent man so consumed with hate that he doesn't wear a gun, the gun wears him. For anyone else this is one of the best of the adult Westerns of the 50s, and years ahead of its time in its attitude to the environment.",1
I guarantee.,1
I give it a 10 / 10!,1
"Also, my 7 - year - old daughter liked the angel effects!",1
It is also hilarious. A must see.,1
"There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Its an energetic movie. < br / > < br / > Therein lies my gripe. It's interesting, really.",1
The baseball scenes are all realistic!,1
My vote is eight. But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment.,1
< br / > < br / > Allen is Allen... In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion. He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. She adds appropriate body language for comic effect.,1
The river Styx was pure genius.,1
"as woody might say, what'not to like?",1
Directed by Woody Allen.,1
He plays the perfect bumbling magician. Don't let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully done film.,1
"But mostly, it's just so damn hilarious.",1
Woody Allen's second movie set in London. I give it an 8. < br / > < br / > Worth seeing.,1
"It wasn't even at the jokes in the movie per se, but at the whole movie itself.",1
"She plays the straight part while Mr Allen does his shtick, a perfect combination. Both are excellent in their banter throughout the film.",1
It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it. I say give it a chance because you just might like it. Johansson and Allen work great together.,1
< br / > < br / > Waterman's character also functions neatly in the plot.,1
"The second he walked on screen audience lit up. < br / > < br / > Check it out, it's worth trip. Great movie, enough laughs and action for any audience.",1
Scoop is classic Woody Allen.,1
Good Woody Allen? No.,1
"< br / > < br / > Thematically, Woody was traipsing familiar ground.",1
"Apparently he actually likes England!! Remember all the "" What happened to Woody Allen? "" She is unafraid to look and act like a real person. Greetings again from the darkness. jokes?",1
He is totally believable in a truly villainous role. He basically would just do what MGM gave him. This film is definitely worth look. This is his best performance.,1
"They simply team up, more or less politely, to carry out St Sid and Sondra have no flirtation, which is a great relief. This time moreover Scarlett's not an ambitious sexpot and would - be movie star. She's morphed surprisingly into a klutzy, bespectacled but still pretty coed.",1
< br / > < br / >'Scoop'is a quickly paced murder mystery. Could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship! If you're a Woody Allen fan you'll probably enjoy yourself. I'm glad I saw the movie and definitely recommend it.,1
Even fluffy stuff.,1
This is a excellent series. One thing they all share is they miss their mom.,1
That was a great episode. Aw. And I love Michelle.,1
it is just a really great sit - com. I am still today growing up on it. It will make you feel a lot better. i give it 5 out of 5 stars. what do you think? she is my favorite. Full House is a great show. you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it.,1
"I had a dad, two sisters, and a dog. Guaranteed. Joey is an aspiring comedian with a kid's heart and soul. What can I say? Three men trying to raise three young girls = hilarious.",1
"Bring the wagon, stop the wagon etc.",1
Full House came to me when I was about 9.,1
It makes you laugh and it is not just humor. But most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy.,1
There is always a lesson you can learn from the show. It has good teachings your kids can learn from. Also there isn't any drugs and violence on it. < br / > < br / > I vote the show a 10. I grew up watching Full House as a child.,1
There is never a dull moment in Full House.,1
i want my kids to watch it one day. and Stephanie is so cool. Joey is good natured and is always in a good mood.,1
I watch it almost every day. This show is about three little girls. I rate it 10 / 10.,1
This is when life was good and simple. I love it. And people knew who Dave Coulier was. But anyway. The Anorexic Twins became popular.,1
"Oh, come on! Why did it end?",1
"( It starts to get better in the ending seasons ) Watch it, you will love!",1
What a little gem.,1
"FULL HOUSE, "" in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I have many other ones that I like, too. It was a two - parter, so you'd have to have seen both parts. """,1
"Only in a TV show. & Stephanie characters. < br / > < br / > I did like the D. J. They even stole from "" The Partirdge Family. """,1
It's very believable!,1
It is a great show for anyone of any age. He plays Jesse.,1
Full House has made me laugh and cry. The sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. What's any more real than that?,1
"Three great comedians! It's Sublime! The next day I kept thinking about the movie, though. Todd dances!",1
"My favorite has got to be Wildcat. He's absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot. Then it's Kit Cloudkicker. And the villains were very original. After that, Louie.",1
Spin it!,1
"Nothing! < br / > < br / > The Characters have a lot of depth to them. Ahh, Talespin! I can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones. and buries his face in his pillow.",1
I cannot get enough of this show.,1
PLEASE BRING THIS SHOW BACK! 9 / 10.,1
Entertaining dialogue?,1
"Russ Tamblyn plays the half breed trying to fit in a white world. His wild eyed killing of not only buffalo but human beings, is stunning to watch. The group is an odd mix of good and evil, young and old.",1
"Europa "" is what cinema shouldtrive to be.",1
"After all, Smith ran for president. I think the film is educational.",1
The background scenery is beautiful.,1
Imagine my surprise when I found myself sobbing!,1
You won't regret it!,1
"What's important is our message and what we stand for. This is a movie about Joseph Smith and a great one at that. Jeffs thinks of the "" Negro "" as devils.",1
"Although downbeat, this is truly great western picture. Have no illusions, this IS a morality story.",1
"I've so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing. < br / > < br / > This movie does not clearly map out the events of Mormon Church history, but merely jumps from scene to scene. Warning : mild spoilers. The face of Jesus is never shown, but you see the unmistakable nail marks in His hands. This is not a critique - simply a note about the style. The operation, done without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult.",1
"I give the movie a "" 10 "" and encourage honest souls to view it. This is the most moving and real portrayal of Joseph Smith that I have ever seen.",1
"I wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman Begins there! If you get to Salt Lake City, it is a must to see it in the Legacy Theater.",1
I was stunned. She has become a member of the LDS Church and he has not. This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins.,1
B.,1
Coburn is a really great villain in this one. Overall it's an entertaining western flick. IMO the beginning is very good.,1
00 in gold coins that keeps them from breaking up and going their own way. Charles Coburn as the vengeful half breed Zach Provo is also at his best as the obsessed with hatred and murder escaped convict.,1
Playing Hal Brickman.. I've seen this film on Sky Cinema not too long ago..,1
Some U. S. government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds... He also enjoy killing Indians who steal his horses...,1
No they don't because Coburn has a mission of revenge. Do he and his friends head for the Mexican border from jail and safety. He knows that Heston has to make it personal then. Of which there is a lot. His Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired. < br / > < br / > The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western.,1
But that doesn't detract too terribly much from the film's psychological approach to the western genre. The result is a taut and violent pursuit through the mountains and deserts of southern Arizona. It is both surprisingly traditional ( good guys / bad guys ) and incredible up - to - date as well.,1
"He teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses. Maybe. It's certainly no protest - by - numbers though, being too warm.",1
For me the most obvious thing that unites these no - budget movies is a real sense of fun.,1
! So it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again. I have to say that this TV movie was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is.,1
It was actually believable.,1
Certainly worth a watch. You can see a bit of what is yet to come. Perhaps that is part of the point.,1
< br / > < br / > P. S. Meadow Sisto is lovely. skip this paragraph if you don't want to learn it ). It made me think.,1
"You can watch this on the internet, so i suggest check it out.",1
Twisted Desire ( 1996 ) was a TV movie starring Melissa Joan Hart. Jessica was released from prison when she turned 21 years old. Thomas was executed in 2000!,1
Have I just imagined this?,1
< br / > < br / > I love the movie.,1
"Yes, a true classic!",1
"< br / > < br / > A warning to all new viewers though : don't watch alone... The Woman In Black is fantastic in all aspects. But then, Arthur attends the funeral, and from that scene on, we don't feel safe.",1
Whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black. Talk about unnerving!,1
This is a plain old spooky ghost story. My copy is VHS.,1
!,1
"It is about time that we had legitimate region 2 DVD release. I can understand why this might not appeal to all palates. I own the book, DVD - R and have the unabridged audio book on my iPod, too.",1
!,1
< br / > < br / > TEN STARS...,1
The first and only time I saw the woman in black was I think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on TV back in 1989.,1
< br / > < br / > I saw this when it was first on TV when I was 10 and it really did disturb me for years. It's remarkable that other viewers'feelings are so unanimous.,1
U. S. A. premier U. S. Comedy Festival Aspen 1999. knyhotz.,1
"Less is more. < br / > < br / > Subtlety can be more terrifying. I have a copy of'The Haunting ','The Changling'and a zillion more. If she appeared too often, it could've cheapened the mood that gets set. But the slow pacing helps give the story credibility. Most horror movies are in fact horrible movies.",1
"I recommend it. The end of movie differs to the book, but still very good.",1
"The other man says, "" you can't go back... alone! "" Another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of church fence, watching the funeral. I was lucky enough to watch this without any pre viewing hype. and lends the hero his dog. As the camera pans to the right, the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones. < br / > < br / > The many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out.",1
"The writer puts many chilling additions into the story, an example being the tin soldier's re - appearance. One is eager to learn the meaning of it all. < br / > < br / > The widow for the most part, looks vicious and intimidating. < br / > < br / > Herbert Wise did not need blood, violence, or gore to send chills down the spines of an audience. I have often woken up at night thinking she was behind me in my sleep.",1
< br / > < br / > The story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes. Spectacular Horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it.,1
This one qualifies on all counts. Waiting for the woman in black to show up is nail - bitingly suspenseful.,1
"Buy it or don't, but message is still there.",1
"Pauline Moran surely could make the devil whimper, that's for sure! !",1
Highly recommended. 10 out of 10. The acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times.,1
"Still, quite acceptable, passable film.",1
"History informs the script, which in turn, shakes history upside down. Monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress, hair, lipstick, wiggle and voice. Goodbye, Norma Jean.",1
"< br / > < br / > Now that's one - of - a - kind! One hot night, four famous iconic figures will come together. However these limitations can't contain the fruitful and daring ideas that Roeg manages to randomly storm up visually and through the meaningful material.",1
< br / > < br / > But I think it's excellent.,1
The last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side! The professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we!,1
"Yet these aspects of the physical universe ( it's all quantum, trust me! ) Each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction. Gradually, we see that obsession itself is the central theme.",1
< br / > < br / > Enter Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is Red. It is utterly amazing. < br / > < br / > But there's more.,1
"But he did it on a low budget. But here she is far from a heroine. < br / > < br / > The title character answers an ad. This is surely his best. It lacks gangsters. The whole cast, in fact, is superb.",1
"Nevertheless, I recommend it.",1
Why? Why don't people believe her?,1
A young woman ( Nina Foch ) agrees to take a position in the home of an elderly woman ( Dame Mae Witty ). And very modest resources.,1
"Her predicament makes no sense. Here, she's anything but kindly or batty. They're going to kill her, but why.",1
< br / > < br / > Well done.,1
"Although clearly low - budget, it bears the signs of clever ingenuity. And lo and behold! Savvy viewers will surely spot them but should rest assured they will not be disappointed.",1
"In the end one is left with the wonder of faith, family and rediscovered love. Lovely period piece capturing 1962. Strongly recommended for all ages from 9 year olds to grannies.",1
It is just that good.,1
It's simple. The comparisons to the HAUNTING are superficial.,1
"Castle of Blood. "" < br / > < br / > They just don't make spook films like this one anymore.",1
"Incredulous, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death.",1
Scared the hell out of me. But no matter.,1
"It is refreshing, therefore, to see this film. The first thing you will notice about Danse Macabre is the style of the film.",1
Steele makes most any film worth seeing. It almost feels padded.,1
Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful.,1
"This film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. George Riviere, the male lead, does a good job with his role.",1
"Thus begins a startling series of supernatural events that bewilder the journalist all the rest of the night. Recommended! The alluring, captivating Barbara Steele is main reason to see it.",1
"Though I didn't know it then, all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre. I had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards! What a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years! No wonder I was so scared!",1
"One of them, Silvano Tranquilli, even gives away a fairly credential depiction of author Edgar Allan Poe.",1
You should see it at least once. Where is the DVD?,1
"Odd, but still watchable. See it for yourself to find out the rest of the story. ! How can this be?",1
8 out of 10. Barbara Steele definitely makes movie too.,1
"And boy, was it ever! Not for nothing has she been called "" The Queen of Horror. """,1
"Antonio Margheriti's "" Danza Macabra "" aka. """,1
A masterpiece!,1
Kind of weird. Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage? She makes the movie a ten!,1
Just watch it. Ja - pan is purely comedy. Yakitate!,1
! Japan is a really fun show and I really like it! It was shown in our country just recently in Hero TV and ABS - CBN every 5 : 30.,1
Yakitate!,1
I truly laughed.,1
( he was never caught ).,1
Davis was so young and fresh.,1
"I WIPED MY MOUTH!! """,1
Too bad she wasn't playing a gangster's moll.,1
"Davis is intense to the point of scary. When I saw that this film was only 80 minutes long, I thought we were in trouble.",1
"In truth, Mildred is repulsed by Philip's club foot. If she seems at times over top, she came from the stage, and the subtleties of film acting would emerge later for her. She was a true actress and a true < br / > < br / > "" Of Human Bondage "" looks rather stilted today in parts.",1
But even that is not all. The story is simply too big to be told in mere 83 minutes. But Ms Davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite.,1
"As the film progresses, Mr. Howard's struggles, instead, to become a doctor. Bette Davis - "" Of Human Bondage "" < br / > < br / > 4. The results were : < br / > < br / > 1.",1
The movie may be great.,1
"It is so hard to watch his efforts at trying to find any civility in this vicious shrew. You just want to shake him. When out at a tearoom he meets a sullen waitress, Mildred ( Bette Davis ).",1
"His wan, somewhat wilted good looks are perfect for this failed aesthete. Her acting in this one doesn't come off well by today's standards. < br / > < br / > As Philip, Leslie Howard is excellent. Davis is watchable, for sure, but so strident and predatory as to seem scarcely human. I imagine the character of Millie as quieter, less feminine than Davis, with maybe a touch of the tomboy.",1
You be the judge! The film seems rather dated now in 2003.,1
"Although man eating Mildred may at times seem one dimensional, she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that Philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her. ( The scene in which Philip and Norah dismiss romance magazines as trash for kitchen maids seems to confirm this ). One may also think she is on to something when she accuses Philip of looking down on her for not being "" fine "" enough. It is perhaps this passivity, these lowered expectations that makes him put up with the selfish Cockney waitress for as long as he does.",1
What a mysterious and almost spooky film.,1
So I bought it. It was impossible to take her character seriously. Worth watching despite Ms Davis vocal gymnastics.,1
"In fact, I like it very much.",1
"Bette Davis'cockney accent in this film is absolutely appalling. It is beautifully conceived, shot and edited. It also has to be viewed in perspective.",1
Both will play again in ¨Petrified forest¨ ( 1936 ). Rating : Very good but a little bit dated.,1
Finally Sally and her dad takes him in. He is constantly thinking about her. So what the nookie is too good. Bette Davis plays Mildred. She has TB.,1
"He is sensitive for several reasons. Witness his poet - dreamer - wanderer in THE PETRIFIED FORREST. I happen to like Leslie Howard, in his better films.",1
"Every motion picture Bette Davis stars in is worth experiencing. That is what makes it her legendary performance. For, it's in "" Dangerous "" ( 1936 ) that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. Doubtless, she deserved more than 2 Oscars ; perhaps as many as 6. She was only 25yo when the film was completed & just about to reach Hollywood's red carpet.",1
"Her Cockney accent is as sharp as Eliza Doolittle's. Re - enter Mildred, replete with a baby, and in her usual need of being taken care of. Perhaps author / physician Maugham didn't care for distaff medicos ). No sex here.",1
Radio Pictures ). How amazing this film is!,1
It is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face. Several features of this film immediately date it.,1
Watching her performance is still spellbinding.,1
I won't deny that. So this movie was also good for my imagination. I used to watch it at least once a week. Get the picture?,1
Later to Philip's shock and surprise Mildred walks back into his life.,1
"When he tries to cling onto Mildred, she rejects him.",1
All much in the style back then. After 21 movies and three years of working in Hollywood Bette Davis finally got a role she claimed as her own and which put her as a force to be reckoned with.,1

"The rudimentary premise of "" What's the matter with Helen? "" The setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique.",1
What's the Matter with Helen? is as fun as any. This ain't Citizen Kane!,1
Ten stars for very good movie. My favorites being Growing Up and Forever Young. And of course I LOVED the songs.,1

The movie recreation of the 1930's is colorful and elegant ( look at Debbie's clothes! ) made with a very tight budget. But still this movie is highly entertaining. The increasing atmosphere of madness and hysteria ). The two stars and Curtis Harrington stylish direction easily overcomes its flaws.,1
Drop!,1

Highly recommended. Hopefully it'll be on DVD at some point. How alone can one man get?,1

My vote is seven.,1
I always sat down and watched the first one. A big hand to Carol and Dean Parks. < br / > < br / > The sound track is great! I tend to annoy everyone by singing it. I think it is a wonderful movie. It was really surprising. It leaves an effect on you.,1
_ A Guy Thing _ covers that. Romantic comedies are tough movies. It's a lot of fun.,1
"< br / > < br / > The cast is talented. But I still miss his work in independent films. In other words, her beauty shows inside and out.",1
I'did'like this movie! Chris Koch delivers another film that is'above average '.,1

Maybe that's one source of disappointment.,1
"A new low, right? I got to say this is one of his good leading roles. This movie is all right.",1
She's on her way to Paul's apartment. Suddenly Karen telephones.,1
And actually I thought Lochlyn Munro did a nice part as the ex. I enjoyed it very much. This movie wasn't afraid to take jokes a little further.,1

No one should miss this picture.,1
"The Lady from Shanghai ended up at a very low "" C "", or a 7, for me. I had a problem with most of the performances, the script and the overall structure. Later, he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him.",1
"It's a shame. Nevertheless, he is always compelling. Still, this movie drags. He made "" Lady from Shanghai "" for his soon to be ex - wife, Rita Hayworth.",1
Welles does not.,1
myspace.,1
"In fact, he was playing.",1
No Offense to any of great film makers of this millennium! He is also wonderful in a Touch Of Evil. Thank you! it is really ignorant. Where else can you plug a film or boo it!,1
"Check out the courtroom scene. 10 / 10. It doesn't matter, however. Usually they are such stock scenes that I can't stand them. His direction defines what great direction is.",1
"But things don't go to plan. < br / > < br / >'The Lady From Shanghai'is film noir at it's most sizzling and confusing. It was a terrific marketing ploy, and he change suits her changed attitude wonderfully.",1
"The first real noir, but even darker. The camera's eye was shocking, but experimental. Several characters as suspects in the mystery. The first mystery is to guess what Welles'original film was like. < br / > < br / > So in telling this story, Welles has to make the environment into a character.",1
Not to mention Care Bears are just too adorable!,1
Critics need to review what they class as a quality movie. < br / > < br / > 10 / 10 Don't miss this artistic noir film from one of great film directors.,1
Gotten better with age so to speak. Nevertheless Sloane takes an apparent liking to Welles and hires him to skipper his yacht. < br / > < br / > So far this film is starting to sound a lot like Gilda. Supposedly Harry Cohn hit the roof as Rita was internationally known for her coppery red hair.,1
The plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of film techniques.,1
"As I watched one of Orson Welles'last contributions to Hollywood as a filmmaker, I knew I was watching a great movie unfold, though at times I did not know why.",1
Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to movie. < br / > < br / > Rita Hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here. No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles. < br / > < br / > We can see the toll it took on Orson Welles the filming of this movie. One can only imagine the film Mr. Welles might have finished without the interference of the studio!,1
"Instead of a slick, wise tongue, he speaks with a rough, Irish twang. After CITIZEN KANE in 1941, Hollywood executives turned their cob - webbed backs on the great Orson Welles.",1

I wish Verducci would make more movies.,1
I would recommend it to other people. But I think he did okay.,1
That doesn't matter ; she's still cool as a nerd. Totally memorable - like she really exists. So is that acting?,1
"Pat Verducci also has the writing credit. I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start. Bill Nunn played "" Captain Arends "". In fact everyone in the cast does a good job. Just a thought!",1
"Stalking human prey he begins his reign of terror! Nelson can't even tell his wife Judy ( Ann Sweeny ). While in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease. Anyway, I really like this film. Which surprised me.",1

They're both good in different ways.,1
"Bernard Hepton as Emma's feeble father was also excellent. An outstanding example is "" Brideshead Revisited "" which had 13 50 - minute episodes back in 1982. Perhaps as a result, even with Kate Beckinsale in the lead, this production sank without trace.",1
!,1
"Instead, her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends. Until the 1990s there had never been a film based upon Jane Austen's "" Emma "". Then two came along in the same year, 1996.",1

She is wonderful. Bravo! Mark Strong did a fabulous job.,1
It seems put on. Pity...... Well done to Kate Beckingsale! I also love the new scene at the end.,1
I've seen this movie after watching Paltrow's version.,1
For me this production was and remains a delight.,1
"Spring Byington is seen as Emily, the mother. He is glue that holds everything together.",1

Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid.,1
High recommended.,1
Four macho rough'n'tumble guys and three sexy gals venture into a remote woodland area to hunt for a bear.,1
So there must be something. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie.,1
"Nothing new, just well acted, fast paced and some pretty ladies. 10 out of 10.",1
< br / > < br / > The film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel.,1
I cannot understand that one single bit. Isn't this a rather consoling thought?,1
"At first I didn't didn't like it that much, although I did. Glenn Close is Ferula.",1
"In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance, with great wisdom, Solomon describes in these words : "" The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you. "" Meryl Streep also brilliant, a woman whose name came to him like a glove Clara.",1
What is told is told fairly well.,1
"But the acting, I think, was terrific. I think don´t belong at that time.",1
"This 1991 NBC - TV movie aired six months before John Goodman's big - screen version of the life of Babe Ruth came out. For my money, there is no comparison between the two.",1
But no problem - it's still a much underrated lovely composition from Marcel Carne. All in all : wonderful.,1
"Atmosphère? This is our French "" Nobody's perfect "".",1
"Their high - flown lines are rather embarrassing too. Fragile Carne, just before his great period. Annabella is very beautiful, but not very good at doing tragic, while Aumont's callowness, brilliantly appropriate though it may be, by its nature obtrudes any real, felt, romance. Maybe it's just me, but I find it hard toympathise with a couple, so young, so attractive, who, after only a few months, are so racked with despair that they have to shoot each other.",1
Garbo is if anything more commanding ( or more beautiful as a screen presence ) and her acting is more restrained.,1
Is Jacques Feyder's film different? ).,1
He captured Garbo's luminescence and the atmospherics of the docks with style.,1
Enjoy!,1
"Master director Ching Siu Tung's perhaps most popular achievement is this series, A Chinese Ghost Story 1 - 3. < br / > < br / > This film is no less full of magic than other films by Ching Siu Tung. This is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happiness.",1
this is a great movie.,1
Highly recommended.,1
Not to repeat other reviews here.,1
The villains are appropriately menacing and frightening. The sets are creepy and atmospheric. The story is engrossing and original. The direction is superb.,1

"First things first, the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed. It's definitely laugh - out - loud. Bravo!",1
"Sinnui yauman, is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film. The trek alone is perilous with wolves, and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple. < br / > < br / > A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details.",1
"The trek alone is perilous with wolves, and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple. The story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm. It's a masterpiece of Hong Kong Cinema. Its my life.",1
The visuals are beautiful too. Absolutely recommended. This movie is one of my favourites. This minor flaw is easily ignored.,1

"Forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned, this is the original and best. This is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting.",1
Very funny film. That's.,1
I think the end is very worth sticking around.,1
"Joan Fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself. She has meanwhile had a lover ( Patric Knowles ) whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either. They continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and socialize as if nothing were wrong. He is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty. She meets the aging Herbert Marshall, who has a yacht with all the trimmings and more money than even Fontaine could figure out how to spend. He is a charming, feckless, but wholly amiable fellow. She targets him and decides he will do nicely. Hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning.",1
Did anyone spot him?,1
She's just her usual Joan Fontainey self. Warning : contains a spoiler.,1
I highly recommend this film.,1
Loved Joan. Great old movie drama.,1
"The sets look phony. H. B. Warner's performance here is, as always, perfect.",1
"The Sea is Watching was an interesting film experience. No panoramic views. It was obvious what we were to look at in each frame. It wasn't that I like fight scenes au contraire but it seemed a little stilted and again, overly dramatic.",1
"Perhaps not his best, but even at his worst, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. It is touching, funny and intriguing in all parts.",1
"The movement of the camera is superb, as well as the actors. It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. Beautiful scenery.",1
They are not accurate on this film. Just a beautiful view! You wont regret it!,1
< br / > < br / > It is uniquely Akira Kurosawa! It is a tale of survival of women in feudal Japan.,1

"There's plenty too. Is there a reason for all of this, and why is it surrounding Raines'character? However it's disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what's really going on here. This is where Winner tries to pull out eerie shades, which projects some icy moments. It's interesting to see names like Sylvia Miles ( who's significantly creepy!",1
"Well worth the look. The flashback scenes are what really made it for me. Beverly D'Angelo has one chilling scene, that I won't spoil. Burgess Meredith is terrific as Chazen.",1
"Time has not been kind to this movie. Overall, pretty entertaining.",1
"The plot is rich with mystery, and begins by focusing on Alison Parker and her hunt for a flat.",1
"That's a pity. This falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her life. This movie isn't all bad, and still has a capacity to shock. < br / > < br / > The cast was competent.",1
But we New Yorkers have known THAT for some time!,1
"00. Then what does he look at? "" Alison's response is very logical - "" Blind? This happens to be one of my favorite horror films.",1
"This movie is creepy and creative. The direction is quite sparta. There is almost no gore. The plot twists are lovely, if a tad predictable.",1
"Or, for that matter, any atmosphere. An ominous music score by Gil Melle adds to the menace.",1
"Then who are all these weirdos? Not a bad little horror flick, maybe good companion piece to "" Burnt Offerings "". She meets several strange neighbors, and even attends a birthday party for a cat. Whoa!",1
I think not.,1
"They're awesomely entertaining. And why? Sigh I sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such a grudge against director Michael Winner? Surely he isn't the avatar of subtlety, as his films are practically always hard - handed and confronting, but so what? Just because certain prudish and easily offended people, who shouldn't watch the movie in the first place, claim it's an unethical thing to do?",1
It sucks. I had to do a double - take when I didn't quite place where I'd seen him before. And AVOID the Goodtimes DVD at all costs. It seems Alison's troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the Vatican to become next sentinel.,1
Alison Parker is a model with some fame.,1
Pay close attention.,1
"Also there is Beverly D'Angelo, who is underrated but great.",1
Do yourself a favour and check it out! It is now one of favourites of all time.,1
"The cast is a constellation of stars and starlets. Alison realizes that she is living in the gateway to hell. Then, he invites Alison to his cat Jezebel's birthday party in the night. Yesterday I saw this movie once more. My vote is nine.",1

"As we move down the tracks, the voice of the Narrator ( Max von Sydow ) counts us down into a deep sleep, until we awake in Europa.",1
"The voice acting is very good, if there is not a lot of it. I'd say it does a great job of that. Thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like.",1
Japan makes some of the best animation in the world. It tells how humans made machines in their own likeness. Sadly most of these shorts are disappointing.,1

"which has been reopened. Or at least that's what you'd have thought. But the prison in this film is a different beast altogether. And boy, are we treated to some awesome death scenes!",1
We focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years. The film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting.,1
"Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. 7 / 10 When the beautiful Kee Nang { Charlotte Lewis } enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child.",1
"Overall, this is recommended.",1
"I sat down and watched, and lo! Prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box. Viggo Mortenson as a very different prisoner being solid. Chelsea Field is okay as the female lead.",1
"It seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived. So... could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated??? "" Haunting!!",1

With Aunt Edna in tow, he catches a Quantas flight to Hong Kong, and then on to London. There is some good news for our hero though ; he meets up with other Aussies in Earls Court, and Fosters is on sale in British pubs.",1
Top notch.,1
"( Barry's response ) Abos? Aussies and Poms will understand, everyone else - well?",1
"It has some pretty good special effects, and exciting action scenes. An elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested on his choice.",1
Americans - - forget it.,1
This movie also had a wounderfull score.,1
7 / 10. In the end he just tries too hard.,1

Staden appears to be doing same here.,1
Viva Nepal!,1
"Suddenly a troop of armed gangsters storm the casino, shooting wildly. Recap : It's business as usual at Louche's casino in Tanger.",1
And I don't want a refund!,1
can't wait for a follow - up... So I may have overrate this movie just a little. It's like a good pilot for a TV - series.,1
I guess wrong. The bad boy is pretty too. Action fused with a fantastic story. Very impressing. See and vote.,1
"It doesn't matter. These characters are important to Blaise's adventures throughout most of the published stories. The result was "" My Name is Modesty, "" a small direct - to - video movie that introduces the character. What this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself. The film does not come across as cheap.",1
"Totally awesome! They hunt for food, and he teaches her to read and fight.",1
It truly is great fun.,1
< br / > < br / > I loved it when I first saw it and I love it still.,1
"Alexandra Staden is credible. To that end, I really hope the film does well in Europe. She has lots of closeups. This is the real Modesty Blaise. That was camp. She is very slim, graceful and poised.",1
I just hope they do better on that if when they make sequels. What we have here is a step or two better than that.,1
I vaguely remember the theme song.,1
This movie is definately one of my favorite movies in it's kind. No such scenes are present or needed.,1
It is also very stylish. And it is certainly the man himself we hear.,1

No such scenes are present or needed. This movie is definately one of my favourite movies in it's kind.,1
Whenever I see most reviews it's called'a misfire for Eddie Murphy '. There's nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take ride.,1

Which all viewers hope will materialise.,1
Everyone who rented it loved it! I loved this movie. ).,1
In fact the only extra I think the DVD was missing was a pair of new pants.,1
This is easily one of my favorite's. This is the way a proper horror movie should be. The special effects were very good.,1
It will keep you completely off balance.,1
They aren't all that important anyways.,1
He's trying to give her more direction.,1
"Mrs. Christian is not a light, but a sun. Now, in our usual world of perception, it is common that objects change signs. ex., if someone grows a bird, his photograph will show him with beard, not without, as it did before. First, nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly.",1
I give it two thumbs up!,1
It offers some genuine scares and plenty of tension. 7 out of 10.,1
"For one thing, she's totally unsympathetic. There's not much new here... it's just done well. This is not a movie to watch while you're eating pizza. I know, I know... she's just gone through a traumatic experience.",1

To be silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime. Instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population.,1
"It is breathtaking, a master class in artistic control.",1
I will tell you. It always comes down to race.,1
My wife and me gave 8 / 10.,1
This was an excellent film!,1
Quite ridiculous in fact. It is not a simple task as he quickly finds out. When the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles. The bomb scene described above really put me off. His job is to attend to the needs of the passengers.,1
To fight against the death penalty is a just cause. One person in the local Public Attorney Offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges. He confesses.,1

Blair Underwood's grandmother Ruby Dee buttonholes Connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson's appeal. < br / > < br / > Criminal justice is not an end, but a process and a never ending one at that for all society. I guess if Just Cause has moral that would probably be it. The cast uniformly turns in some good performances. < br / > < br / > Of course the reverse is equally true.",1
Bobby Earl gets a re - trial. Whom he immensely detests. A Compelling Thriller!,1
Zentropa is the most original movie I've seen in years.,1
< br / > < br / > Maybe Sean Connery was miscast in his role. This movie really is a mixed bag. His performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie. He's truly chilling and acting superbly. I feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it.,1
He is also convinced of the young man's innocence. Arne Glimcher directed.,1
Books and films are different media. Who cares?,1
She hires him.,1
I love this film.,1
"Still, these characters weave a very interesting web together. Mark my words! Magda is a prostitute, the character i liked the best.",1
It is not for mass consumption ( and that is not a compliment ).,1

"He makes Leaving the bank, a bully steals the check. It's blank. Preston Waters is off to a bad summer.",1
The acting was good and bad. Back to the story. But also it sucks.,1
Of course the Dogme - films acted only as a vehicle for this theory ( besides creating some welcome spotlight on Von Trier ). In this movie we can see how good Von Trier's handles film as a technical medium. ( These elements were also very omnipresent in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark. ) Mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to ( self - ) destruction.,1

No.,1
An unusually straight - faced actioner played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously.,1

So why did I watch it? I gave it a 9. Reading the earlier comments persuaded me to give it a shot.,1
Space Cobra himself is witty and likable. Check out if you can. The style is very sixties Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello.,1
This film is a great fun. But I don't want to give anything away.,1
I tend to agree with him. This is the fifth von Trier film I have seen.,1

He bribes her. The story is nice.,1
"After all Madhubala, a prostitute role performed by Preity is amazing. But still then it is a doubt. They are considered as thriller makers of Bollywood. which are required to make a movie hit. Why?",1
"The cinematography was unfortunately bad. She just should do more such roles. Mustan? Have you heard of insemination? Come on, it's cheesy and unrealistic. < br / > < br / > 7 / 10 for film! Does it hurt to attempt some originality, Abbas? Watch it for Preity. Why?",1
Rani Mukherjee was adequate. There are some very little plot holes. Otherwise the movie is definitely worth a watch. The songs are pretty nice.,1
I say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer! Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai nothing stood out. The main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled.,1
What happens next? Rani and Preity are wonderful. I was right. Raj finds a girl. She is a dancer and a prostitute.,1

Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her stage name.,1
Which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy. The actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood's all - time beauties and the film is in black and white.,1

"Marie is a stick of a girl, unattractive, but determined. A French film Ester Williams would love.",1
"Frogs sit on water lilies. Lolita "" is a fata morgana.",1
She's kind of odd looking.,1
"Marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl : she suffers inwardly. Floriane, like this film, promises a bit more then she truly offers. Being less special Anne is more truly accessible to the boys.",1
But it's watchable.,1
"It's a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie, due to its subject and visual approach. < br / > < br / > A good movie on its subject. The film premiered at Cannes in 2007 and actually won some awards there as well. Sexuality is a big theme within the movie, which gets handled delicately and subtle.",1
"The film reverses some conventional stereotypes about sexuality. The shy, retiring Marie is slim and petite and appears to be the youngest of the three.",1
< br / > < br / > Bon cinéma! The soundtrack is A + by the way.,1
"The English title is "" Water Lilies "". It is no different for boys. Soon they will walk together.",1
"It pulls some "" standard "" pressure methods out of the high hat and works on them. Everyone is completely believable.",1
Marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool. Three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relation. See the film to learn more. This one is no exception. Put a stress on reputation. Marie is not phased out by that reputation. We get to see a lot of synchronized swimming as we become familiar with the three girls. The base of the triangle is barely there. < br / > < br / > The first half is set up.,1
The camera works beautifully also.,1
the musical score is very good. the story DOESN'T make sense.,1

Beautifully filmed ( especially evident in the restored version and on DVD ) and directed, it takes place in the nice park - like setting of a planet which the Enterprise has just arrived to.

"Good, but unexceptional. Nothing wrong with the episode, though. """,1
"Perhaps this episode was written for a little fan R & R too! Really, a great idea but not that well executed.",1
"Just dreams? So why not to play with animation? First of all, Riget is wonderful. I know that Lars likes to experiment. So why not to make small experiment with Riget3? Even marketing one! and I have some idea.",1
"Robert DiNiro's character was just a bit too contrived. < br / > < br / > I'll give an "" A "" for effort.",1
"And Shore Leave, despite its occasional problems, is an example. < br / > < br / >'nuff said. Bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this.",1
The acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films.,1
All of whom do an exceptional job. HOLLOW MAN gets 5 / 5. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. A rehashing of a killer shark movie.,1
"Most of first tries ended up unstable. 3 out of 5 stars! Great movie, plenty of fun. Remember H. G. Wells'"" The Invisible Man ""?",1

"So what? I judge any film, on it's own merits, not by it's source. It doesn't really matter. What really sets "" Earth, 2009 "" apart is its'scope. There have been a few other nature documentaries that also excelled in these categories.",1

And you can take your kids!,1
This documentary makes you travel all around the globe.,1
"When the film opened I already knew it would end far too soon for me. 90 minute cinema version based on "" Planet earth "" which I watched all on BBC TV.

The truth is : I never thought our planet was so astonishingly beautiful!,1

Sometimes both at the same time.,1
It skips much of the scientific detail that Attenborough covers in his'Planet Earth'series. 'Earth'is an easier movie.,1
Certainly one that I encourage you to see.,1
"Interestingly, the film is very male oriented - - the women are mere appendages.",1
"CITY HALL is a somewhat mixed bag. I love showtunes, too.",1
"There are much more comedy in this, good one, though. Also be prepared to see some more. Thought it was unoriginal and didn't fit. It's an odd story and setting. They are all very good.",1
< br / > < br / > And the power behind power.,1
< br / > < br / > I absolutely hate talking about Al Pacino. In City Hall Pacino plays the New York City mayor. The man is acting royalty.,1
"And what was to happen happens and a few people, including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that criminal. The film concerns a classic theme. We are not speaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest. That is not typical of New York.",1
"Santos and Tito ending up getting shot and killed by each other. It soon became evident that the person who got Judge Stern his job, for a $ 50, 000. * * * SPOILERS * * * When undercover Brooklyn North Det.",1
"Individual idiosyncrasies are also explored, including Aiello's emotional bond with the music of Rogers and Hammerstein. Much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations. How did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence?",1
I don't award many tens. There is murder. This one richly deserves!,1
"It requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer. The thing is, the public knows that something is wrong, for sure! I watched it 3 times in a row! but following details is hard to do. What a nice change. In that movie, their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense.",1
It just so happens to open in New York.,1
Danny Aiello was superb as always. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. The ending didn't have a lot of sting.,1
"Like the first, this also brings up some loaded ethical questions. Both qualities show in this. The strong graphic material of the first also returns, and it's been kicked up a notch.",1
"A story of friendships, father - son relationships, corruption and deceit.",1
"No one watches anyone else whenever he's on. He's very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them, do Aiello in. He knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film. The story mushrooms and at the end it's reached inside City Hall itself.",1
The workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and couldn't believe it.,1
This film however was mesmerizing.,1
Need to see more documentaries like this.,1
"The film is never preachy, is not guilt driven, and allows everyone's point of view to be present. Wow! They play with toys, jump rope, and dance.",1
Bravo to the filmmaker for getting inside and finishing the film!,1
"More like psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho does sound better as a header. It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's a only a brief snippet not big of a deal anyways. < br / > < br / > Or in other words, he might spoil them for you.",1
"Cinematically, it is a gem.",1
So What?,1
Just don't expect to see something outbreaking. I admit creating great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it ( and they are not pervs! ) as a must see.,1

"It's a terrific warm - up for what is arguably the BEST story : number 3. High expectations are allowed for this film, since it was entirely written by Robert Bloch! The second story stars ( Hammer ) horror - legend Peter Cushing as a retired stockbroker.",1
"The House That Dripped Blood "" is one of the better anthology films of the time period. The atmosphere here is what sets it apart. Ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from Jane's past, which John vehemently denies. The classic moment is the kill in psychiatrist's office, which is an all - time high for creepiness.",1
"Brilliant cinematography. Moves at a slow, but stead pace. Some haunting moments and images. Clichés galore.",1
"In four parts, the film tells the tales of four different heirs. The first segment is a great kickoff to the film. The tale is delightfully weird, and the second - best of the film, after the third.",1
Plot contrivance similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good uncanny vibes.,1
RIP Peter.,1
"Though slow, this one ended very well. So, for a change of scenery, they rent this house. Yes, this IS a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun! < br / > < br / > The second, while not bad at all, is probably weakest.",1
Highly recommended to fans of omnibus fright fare. No - nonsense Inspector Hollaway ( a solid turn by John Bennett ) investigates the disappearance of a famous thespian and uncovers the wicked past history of a creepy old house.,1
"There is subtle physchedelia here via his torment that I found amusing yet creepy. She has a natural talent for it, with good reason. Oh and those horrible prop teeth ( then again these are British actors, maybe those were REAL!!! )",1
"The actor really gets what he paid for. This movie is another horror anthology. It has four stories all somewhat connected by a house. It is rather good, but it could have used a bit more.",1
"Well come to find out... if she knew what Lee did, she would have certainly understood. There were nice Gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance. This one ' I won't spoil it for you.",1
"Dominic may or may not be real, so director Peter Duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. This episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror.",1
"Production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget Duffell had to work with. Though the linking device itself is not all that great, the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable. That's all we need out of it, really.",1
"Most effective in this episode is the dream sequence, although it's great as always to watch Cushing. The "" dying "" moments are particularly horrific.",1
"Although, that movie is very different from the others. < br / > < br / > I spent many years trying to track down this movie. My feelings for them today are just as strong. It wasn't quite as good as I was led to believe.",1
Oh well.,1
The story is sweeping.,1
A very good and unusual movie score too.,1
"Elliott'performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability. The key to this segment, as with the others, is the mystery surrounding the events that take place.",1

"Tassi was really responsible in the planned murder of his wife, whom he had begotten from rape. In fact, far from it. The story is like a sad love story with an unhappy ending.",1
"The scenic locales of the film offer an idea of what inspired that school of painting to show in their canvases. She had to go to Rome in order to distance herself from that unhappy time of her life. Artemisia Gentileschi, the daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, showed an early promise as a painter. She is a gorgeous creature who awakened passion in men. Agnes Merlik directed with sure hand showing a visual style of her own.

! It actually has a point. Just a well put together movie!!!,1
I immediately bought one for my dorm this September. I saw a group of four mid - 60s women come in. And they're funny. This is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly. The poster is possibly the funniest I've ever seen for a movie.,1

"A blonde one? LOL, LOL, LOL. She even grabs the romantic attention of a State department official.",1
! I have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending.,1
I was very pleasantly surprised with this film. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.,1
SPOILERS Sex huh?,1
Andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. As we all know the sub - genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded. It's like my life story. Simply being excessively raunchy isn't enough anymore. Combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer. Andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology.,1
9 on IMDb.,1
Just some of mediocre ones. Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film. ! You have to see it two or three times to get it all in. This movie is a riot.,1
"When Andy rides his bike to work, he signals his turns. It's the little things that make this film work.",1
"), but it's very smartly done.",1
< br / > < br / > Kal is Andy's co - worker at SmartTech.,1
A wonderful performer. Not many.,1
It's two hours of non - stop laughing. The end couldn't have been better. It's an even rarer case when the critics will like it.,1
If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame. I feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect. My mom would've walked out during first scene. I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald ; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. < br / > < br / > So how raunchy is it? Honestly.,1
"original, charming, and very funny. highly recommended.",1
"Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well. This is his first starring role, but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle.",1
My girlfriend and I both loved it. Everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect. or small children. I can't wait to get DVD. What a great surprise.,1
"Without giving anything away, it reminded me of'Something About Mary '. I would highly recommend. And so begins Andy's quest into adulthood.",1
I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. He has a style that I haven't seen before.,1
Just came out of a sneak preview for this film. It had me laughing every 30 secs.,1
"They're chemistry was great. BEWARE SPOILERS. Romantic, sweet, yummy. The bathroom scene - WOW!",1
"What's more, there's a movie out about it, and it's called "" The 40 Year - old Virgin. "" And then the unexpected happens : he falls in love.",1
A class act but underrated and forgotten.,1
what a relief to find out I am not imagining this programme! the summary from taxman is great.,1
This is a crying shame. Most notable were the unforgettable titles. Barriers seems to be one of those series that have been lost in the mists of time.,1
"Oh well, I can't wait for the DVD.",1
If it is ever issued I will certainly buy.,1
"If you missed'Hippies ', give it a try.",1
SPOILERS!!! ) This is the art of film at its best. Sheridan is the next Robert Towne.,1
"Bravo "" The Spaz "", Bravo! Kudos to you sir! Especially for a student film!",1
!,1
"But so what? And for that, it is great fun to watch. I tend to differ on this point.",1
This was true brilliance. It'more for adults.,1
None of this communication appeared on the film. I have watched this movie three times. Perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically. This pattern held with Harris and two husbands. Ann's behavior seems totally inexplicable. She always had a falling out with her men and she rejected them. How did she afford to buy such a house on meager earnings of her singing career?,1
"For this viewer, seeing the film on a DVD in the quiet of the home, a very different reaction occurred.",1
"Needless to say now, but I recommend Evening highly. See it you will enjoy it.",1
"< br / > < br / > Ann Grant Lord is dying. If you cannot enjoy a chick flick, stop right now. Ann's other best friend is Lila's brother, Buddy.",1
I think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years. Streep's performance actually is little more than a cameo. The backstory to this should have been developed more. Their interplay is weak. Claire Danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth.,1
"Maybe there are few mistakes, after all. Nice girl. This irony is intended!",1
"This is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her lifethe one that got away. < br / > < br / > It is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid. No matter what happens, though, the film is not about these people and what they do, good or bad.",1
Why motherhood is so important in the story? My vote is seven. Which issues Ann Lord has resolved after visit of Lila Ross? Later the bride - to - be confesses her true feelings about Harris to Ann.,1
Will the corridors of power in our nation's capital ever be the same?,1
Everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film.,1
"How hard it is to really know a parent as "" person ""!",1
I loved the message that there are no mistakes.,1
"Individual tunes are woven into a symphony. < br / > < br / > Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson, and a large cast - yes, it could have turned into a multiple star platform.",1
She plays the black sheep of the family ; a little lost. The cast is glowing in Evening. I can't wait to see her act in something else in the future.,1
I caught Evening in the cinema with a lady friend. Are we all one day fated to realize that love never lasts forever?,1
"< br / > < br / > It's not that I dislike the movie. Reading it, I can understand why she had such struggle adapting it. I feel disloyal to Ms. Minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work.",1
"Also, what sumptuous parade of 1940s / 50s automobiles.",1
I give this movie 7 / 10.,1
He is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war.,1
"She remarks that he, like her, "" is doing time "" - her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slave.",1
I had a crush on a cartoon dog.,1
Carface is quite threatening. Character development existed! I also loved King Gator's song. ). I'm a sucker for pre - 2000 animated films. The good guy dies. Gambling is a key element in the movie.,1
"Charlie tries to make up for it by buying her dresses. It was set in New Orleans in 1939. This is a cartoon, and that's why it is logical here. He uses the money toward his casino / bar / theatre, and not the other "" poor. """,1
"Parents, I'd say watch it first. This movie is an excellent film, let alone for a kids'movie.",1
"But this was OK, he simply goes heaven and they let it in that way.",1
"< br / > < br / > The ending of this movie works, but I honestly hate it. It just sounds weird. ), Charlie is tricked and murdered by Carfax. All Dog's Go to Heaven is an animated kid's movie like no other. One thing that keeps this down, is that it's a musical.",1
"Oh, Yes. Dogs Are So Cute As Little Mice.",1
"This movie did a fantastic job of that. This OVA is kinda the opposite. So, I'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti - war story.",1
"7 / 10. Unfortunately, there were some bits I didn't like so much.",1
I love All Dogs Go to Heaven even though I'm a guy. Soon Charlie awakens and finds out that Ann Marie is gone! Soon Carface shows up and captures Ann Marie.,1
Which I Believe makes the movie from good to great.,1
"Don Bluth, thank you.",1
Those are beautiful songs. They are so cute.,1
"That depends on the kid. I saw this movie when I was 10, I absolutely loved it.",1
I'm unsure about how adults would react to it.,1
In that picture he appeared quite dubious to his role of villain. Now he must rescue her from dreaded Carface. I still love this movie even at the age of 22.,1
It is set during the prohibition in the United States. Itchy is his sidekick. ). The backgrounds are good too. Five : The songs in this are lovely.,1
"UC 0079, the One Year War is almost at an end. I would rate it more of a drama than action.",1
"I managed to track it down a few weeks ago, however, and was pleasantly surprised again.",1
But it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals. Recommended for the whole family.,1
How could they not? I'm 22 years old and the ending still gets to me.,1
This is good and your kids will probably like it. All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie that I have always liked.,1
"Yes, there are continuity glitches. It gets 10 simply because it made me feel. It's a great movie.",1
A treat for Don Bluth fans and animation buffs. But do keep a tissue in handy. Often very dark and frightening at times. I loved this film when I was little.,1
It's an amazing movie.,1
What a fun movie St. Ives is.,1
Cue treachery!,1
The fundamental difference is the Story and the Director. His stunt scenes are clearly outstanding.,1
The direction is very good.,1
but i know the people has deferent chooses so ya.,1
"of three. In this'saga of Indian emotions'then, we have a happy family ( isn't it always? ) His love for Aditya though, results in his procrastination of the grave issue. Writer Aatish Kapadia ( he also penned We've got it!",1
Ishwar's pampering has only spoil him all the more. Aditya is still at his blithe best leading a carefree life.,1
Highly recommended.,1
).,1
Great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. Thus all his actions become unescapably logical.,1
"When the latter learns it, he kills her in a fit of anger. < br / > Eventually, the chief idea of the film concerns Ferrot himself. But his superior knows that he usually works alone.",1
"Her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well. Its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be "" safe ""! She is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son's advances on her. Its much more personal and people can relate to it. The ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between Richard and Trudi are totally funny!",1
"However, it can't think of a good way of putting the two Ah, I see. The series itself? Stop! It's not going to end well for Katie. Unwisely, she's now taken up with his son. Husband is infertile.",1
Plus the male cast are not bad on eyes too.,1
"See it, i recommend it to all young people.",1
Some of the movie was shot aboard the U. S. S. Belleau Wood.,1
! This is my favorite movie EVER.,1
!,1
"Also a great piece of casting was Joy Bryant as Fisher's girlfriend, Cheryl.",1
< br / > < br / > And I wasn't. In any film.,1
"< br / > < br / > < br / > < br / > Antwone Fisher's story is one that should find resonance with any empathic individual. He is understatedly, and thoughtfully, portrayed by Derek Luke. That would be a sad commentary on race - relations in North America in and of itself. I can say that it is the best film I have seen all year.",1
But what can you expect from the acting ` Master D'himself. Ok!,1
"Viewers may go to this movie expecting a "" Black Movie : what is a "" Black Movie? "" < br / > < br / > Do stereotypes of pimps, whores, drug dealers, single parent homes, and so forth constitute a "" Black Movie? "" That is to say, Denzel deserved awards for "" Malcolm X, "" "" Hurricane "" and others before that jive "" Training Day "" Oscar.",1
Enjoy!,1
What makes this film good is the fact that it's not overly melodramatic. Quite contrary!,1
He had a strong presence in this movie. < br / > < br / > Get ready to shed a tear or two. Priceless.,1
Kleenex alert - - Feel good tearful.,1
"He is at first unwilling to talk, but when he begins, the floodgates are opened. It is a heartfelt if somewhat formulaic look at the painful process of moving from being consumed by one's past to being able to live life in present time. < br / > < br / > The only friend he has is a local by named Jesse ( Jascha Washington ) who, later in the film, only adds to his feelings of abandonment.",1
"( The story is based on life of Antwone Fisher, born 3.",1
One of most moving cinematic scenes I have seen.,1
"< br / > < br / > As a Clevelander I appreciated the location footage. < br / > < br / > The scene where Antwone meets his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film. Even if some of the homes and administrators don't seem to care and appear self - serving, many do give it their all. No matter where you are from, you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem. Abandoned by a troubled mother, Antwone has never met his father.",1
"The boy genius, Irving Thalberg. The producer?",1
"And now I am a success! "" One died. It even caused me to realize that I do have a "" missing piece "" and I am going to seek out my birthparents now. < br / > < br / > I cried for almost a day after I saw this the first time. BUT another set of parents picked me up and loved me. And it helped me to realize just how messed up our social system is.",1
Antwone's past is revealed in detail. The film has a very professional look.,1
My vote is eight.,1
10 out of 10. A stunning film of high quality.,1
An adaption of the book'Finding Fish '.,1
"It was even featured in VH1's "" I Love the 80's. "" Especially when he delivers lines such as, "" Don't you wish you were me? I know I do! "" Why should you see Arthur? Running time : 97 minutes. Written and directed by Steve Gordon. Classified PG.",1
I absolutly love this movie. Now my whole family has it memorized. We quote it at least once a day. ! A lot of laughs. I still laugh after all this time. And I know it will do same for you!,1
"She meets fellow slapstick star William Haines, who is immediately smitten with her. A treasure of film. The jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is Davies outrageous southern costume.",1
Worth seeing many times.,1
< br / > < br / > What can I say?,1
This comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone. The end was happy for Linda and Arthur although the latter knew that his life will change in coming future. Rich people are not usually happy with their ways of life.,1
"The ladies of the piece are also well portrayed. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice. This is one of my favorite comedies ever. Arthur proposes, but then unwisely falls for Linda, a waitress and petty thief.",1
"Quite simply, IMHO the movie is a rare gem.",1
I don't know that actor. 'Arthur'is just fun.,1
"That is not way I wish to be remembered. "" ""... "" More than enough. """,1
We have most lines memorized.,1
"( I know that doesn't make much sense, but that's what happened. )",1
They were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it. It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable. < br / > < br / > The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to this.,1
"It is darker. And there is some interesting soul - searching. < br / > < br / > This is a truly splendid movie. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he has never played any other comic role. Perhaps the best of these was'Bedazzled '. 'Arthur'is the result. Guilgud only gets a cameo appearance at beginning and as a ghost. Moore's clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable.",1
Truly this was one of Best Comedies of the 1980s.,1
"Sir John Gielgud was number 35 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and film was number 53 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.",1
John Gielgud gets all juicy lines and polishes them off with relish.,1
"Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons. He spent his life being a perfect party guest. That's a full time job as we see demonstrated in Arthur. We should all have such troubles. < br / > < br / > And that's what Dudley Moore is, a wastrel.",1
"But, apparently, nearly a third of its audience has so managed. 4 out of 10 possible.",1
"Yes, I agree, Sir John stole absolutely every scene.",1
Arthur is an interesting fellow.,1
"He gets Peggy an acting job. 1928 is in many ways a "" lost year "" in motion pictures.",1
Over time they become romantically involved. < br / > < br > A good film all round.,1
There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father.,1
He's great too.,1
It plays almost like a 1930's - style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes.,1
There are hilarious set pieces aplenty. He also refuses to leave the bottle. ).,1
He was one of my all time favourite actors.,1
"Who was that short little guy "" - when she finds out she faints!! But I hadn't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful. ! They convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success. I had seen Marion Davies in a couple of movies and really couldn't understand her appeal.",1
WHAT ABOUTORY!!!??? Ya.,1
I was gutted to find out that he had died when i browsed Google.,1
"I admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died, i felt the programme did to. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show. He is funny in parts but I felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedy series. I think the Granddad is funny ( Especially when he's watching Great escape ) but feel C. J is unnecessary to show. Eight Simple rules started as a very entertaining series.",1
"This show is awesome. The next time it shows, I will watch it over over again.",1
I always laughed at that.,1
And it is. My personal favorite episode is in last season.,1
"And also wins the heart of young comic actor William Haines. She gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face, but learns her trade. That in itself makes Show People a film worth saving.",1
John's loss shocked the world.,1
"Let me say first that this show was top tier when John Ritter was there. < br / > < br / > Katey Sagal is great as well, and she too is a likable character. She is off wall hilarious with her innocent'blonde'humor and how conceited she is. It's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment.",1
"I know it sounds boring, but comedically, she fits perfectly. Each one was a standout. Al Bundy was our hero. Quite a résumé. Cate is the conservative mom and loving wife. Again, this is the kind of perfectionism that we've come to expect from Tom.",1
I'm almost surprised it's Disney!,1
Life TV network. More so than any show that old.,1
But this masterful film proved me wrong.,1
"The Big Bad Swim, "" a genuinely good independent film, has had to swim upstream on its own.",1
The plot is fairly thin.,1
See it if you get opportunity. < br / > < br / > What surprised me about the film was how real it felt. Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well.,1
Writing something genuine and true is challenging.,1
"I never cringed. The festival highlights some of the best independent and non - mainstream films from the past year. The Big Bad Swim "" needs to be seen.",1
I'm sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance.,1
"with von Stroheim, Walsh and DeMille. ). That she had fame handed to her and was undeserving, is often speculated. As a comedienne however, her star shone very brightly.",1
"Further, the music is terrific.",1
"pretty soon in became clear this is no comedy, or at least not a'Jim Carrey type'one.",1
The end Just great.,1
"This is one of those films. That's a gift. She makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend. It's beautifully shot and directed, and the casting is excellent. I can not say enough nice things about The Big Bad Swim. I felt like my adrenaline had kicked in.",1
"He attempts, more or less, to fend them off, with varying results.",1
But Janeway's expected this! Voyager has made it back home. He's like a child. There's one problem.,1
"What a GREAT job! Voyager's episodes also progresses through time unlike TNG. I love Tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a Vulcan. I was not really a big fan of Star Trek until past 2 - 3 years.",1
Voyager could have continued. It's very tense. I think I am. Am I satisfied with the ending?,1
Try and find a scene in which she doesn't appear.,1
She is much better suited to drama than to comedy. < br / > < br / > Wow!,1
Yet it was done so well.,1
I thought this movie did a down right good job.,1
Just the kind of movie I love.,1
"In fact, the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertaining. That's the genre. < br / > < br / > And a fun film it is.",1
He really sucked.,1
"She's not even close. Compared to Sharon Stone, Madonna is too coarse and BAUERISCH. Attempts at censorship were vehemently denied.",1
If not always in the right way. Check out the memorable quotes section for a chuckle. Equally her reaction to such accusations seems very casual.,1
< br / > < br / > Davies was adorable and lively comedienne.,1
Still I recommend it. She survives - - he doesn't. The acting is good across the board. It feels like a retread of the first. < br / > < br / > This movie was doomed before it even opened.,1
Go see! That's what movies are designed for - - escapism.,1
We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. The critics are a bunch of morons. not just good but very good. Is that not right?,1
It still left me wondering at end but in a more satisfactory way. I cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers.,1
"Give it a shot, you might be glad you did!",1
"And really, I was very positively surprised!",1
I voted this film 10 and I tell you why : Game opens in London this time.,1
"Five years later, we have it. That said, I shall evaluate the film. It's a film for fun.",1
She looks good and that's. So don't listen to them.,1
I don't understand your objections to this movie. Get over it!,1
I was captivated by her. That goes for critics as well.,1
"The score is amazing as well. Fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen. As such, it never claims to be either.",1
"First comments on this movie were so vicious that I had to see for myself. Since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie, he can keep your attention from beginning to end.",1
Now that is talent.,1
"In the middle is Oliver. The best is Nancy. His innocence is unsullied, but untried as well. Things are not as they seem.",1
I hated the Oliver Twist kid tho. AWESOME. The supporting actors were great too.,1
"William Haines gives an engaging, likable performance as her boyfriend and co - star Billy Boone, but this is leading lady's show all the way. It's still funny and its satirical points still resonate.",1
The musical numbers are all memorable.,1
"for the first time as an adult, I saw it in a new light. It was undeniably catchy and sounded like a real pub tune that drunks might start singing around a piano. Upon viewing "" Oliver! "" As a child I always hated being forced to sit through musicals.",1
< br / > < br / > My all - time favourite'' bad guy'' has to be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes.,1
I saw this recently on a cable channel.,1
A film for entire family. Delicious!,1
A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.,1
Oliver Reed was masterful. Who will buy this beautiful movie? You Should!,1
That movie was awesome! I can't get over it's songs.,1
"The underscore for that moment is brilliant. However, I don't mind.",1
I admit not being that fond of Oliver!,1
For a moment she even denies her ( poor ) past! !,1
"Despite the unlawful nature of the job, Oliver finds good friends among his new “ family ”. The great cinematic musicals were made between 1950 and 1970.",1
No comparison.,1
""", she said. "" The young woman Fagin does. "" Didn't you like the changes?",1
"Simply put, Oliver! is one of the greatest musicals of all time.",1
"', on the other hand, is much closer to the mark. It's not really Dickens at all. < br / > < br / >'Oliver! He could be serious and hilarious in the same sentence.",1
"The secret was revealed by on a 2004 UK documentary titled "" Oliver! After They Were Famous "".",1
Oliver! It all just seems perfect.,1
Always makes me cry! ! I've loved it ever since!!,1
"The song "" Who Will Buy? "" Good show!",1
Catch it on cable if you can.,1
It is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre. The female vampire Una certainly is the coolest vampire since Blade's Deacon Frost. It simply could have used bit more excitement. this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been.,1
"It really takes some beating. And obviously aiming on the "" From Dusk Till Dawn "" - audience. """,1
"< br / > < br / > I generally would not watch a horror movie. He can act well and that's come to be expected of him. < br / > < br / > So, gore fans might be disappointed, but story fans will not. Is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained? No.",1
There were some bad things about this movie. Jon Bon Jovi ( Derek ) was great in this movie.,1
I was quite surprised at how this played out.,1
Dell Henderson plays the father. They're great together! A sweet romance and delightful spoof of early Hollywood. Odd that MGM never teamed them up in a talkie. Davies and Swanson were friends. Polly Moran is a maid.,1
< br / > < br / > Sinatra's entrance is quite funny.,1
Not a bad bunch at all. Only Michele starts looking at another. He's the butler and she's the scullery maid to Leon Errol.,1
brother.,1
"But he does. I loved it so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. I adore him in Forsyte Saga, and all else I've seen him in.",1
CONTAINS SPOILERS! The cast was brilliant. Another thing.,1
"I just love watching women like these on screen. The love story is beautifully handled, with real passion and feeling by well - matched actors. But those old, well - told stories have enduring power, and this is one's a hidden gem. < br / > < br / > The actors are superb best Brits have to offer. No one's perfect ).",1
"Other than that, this is very good - quality.",1
So re the story as in the film I'm equivocal.,1
I am not even sure if he is a good actor as my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively! < br / > < br / > Tara Fitzgerald is excellent as the long - suffering Helen Markham.,1
He is the force of passion and hope that will restore Helen's injured spirit. I highly recommend viewing it! What can be said of the compelling performance of Tara Fitzgerald?,1
!,1
George Burns deserved that Oscar. You can find that in this film. It's a damn shame they died. I highly recommend it. This Comedy is an instant classic.,1
There are some very JAWSish moments with the stallion that defy belief. < br / > < br / > The best thing about this film is the acting.,1
< br / > < br / > The subject matter skip around an awful lot. It is amazing how we function.,1
I've never been huge on IMAX films.,1
! you will understand when you see it.,1
#NAME?,1
< br / > < br / > A fantastic film with a large chill factor. ! How was'Craig'created and what happened to him? < br / > < br / > There is much mystique in this film.,1
The meets is explosive and liberating for the old questions. My rate is 7.,1
And it does just that.,1
"What it hasn't got is logic and a solid plot but, to tell you the truth, that didn't bother me for one second. "" The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used. The obvious aspect - to - love is the outrageous gore! I really dug the creep - character!",1
"However, after a hectic working day, she dozes off and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform.",1
It was a fun ride.,1
"A horror film writer should not need feel compelled to dot every i and cross every t, in the same way a writer of political thrillers might be expected to. An excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script. Someone, or something, is down there with her and it's intentions are wholly malicious. She awakens to find the place deserted, but quickly comes to realise that she is far from alone.",1
"He hits rock bottom when in a drunken rage he manhandles his young sons and knocks his wife to the floor. Emory's father - a dedicated union man - is sure the plant will reopen and recalls for his son all the short - lived closures during his own 35 years at the mill. as a lifetime of hard work and devotion to job, union, church and family have left him with nothing and nowhere to turn.",1
8 / 10. However where in the U. S. can they move to?. It is very disturbing and realistic.,1
Ic an't find it anywhere! This movie struck home for me.,1
See if you can recognize John Goodman before he put on weight.,1
"When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? For me, the pleasure linger.",1
"See how many times you can spot the camera crew too. Following a Mad Max 3 (! ) Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later.",1
"< br / > < br / > Okay, let's not fool each other here. This list is totally accurate and I It's a totally delirious movie ; I loved it. They each keep half a dollar note as a symbol that McBain is in Santos'debt.",1
"Whoever he or she was I like them because I love this film! Total Recall, Top Gun. The scenes and actors and explosions etc.",1
I think not.,1
No one else is willing to go that far.,1
"What a fun b - movie! Sure, they're not for everybody but to each his own.",1
"I agree that Matthau was unfortunate to be up against Nicholson in "" Cuckoo's Nest "" that year. < br / > < br / > About 1976 Oscars... This is a masterpiece of comic acting. All the criticisms registered here have valid points.",1
Yes it's a low budget B - movie.,1
reaction when they see him! I would be angry too!,1
As if he's an expert on that.,1
Forget Fearful Symmetry's dubious originality and just enjoy it as deeply satisfying X File.,1
1958,1
George Burns did a great job. Boy are you wrong.,1
Vic Morrow as the villain is superb.,1
The Sheriff knows McCord knows. The race begins... Michael McCord. He knows how his brother died. The ones who tried to outrun the Sheriff? A black flamed'34 Ford coupe.,1
I suspect the latter.,1
Saying a film is depressing isn't necessarily a bad thing.,1
The Good Earth is a great movie! !,1
"His is now a legendary luminescence. I was not ready, perhaps. But all will not come from it with the joy that I did. She amply deserved her Oscar. So many years have I waited to see this eternal story!",1
Luise Rainier plays Olan. I think you can.,1
"I think the best line of the film is Burns mentioning that Matthau called him "" a son of a bitch bastard "". Very good!",1
The movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat hammy performance by the lead played by Paul Muni. The definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it'pulled off pretty well.,1
She has been called wooden and one - note. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. There is a small grain of truth in that.,1
"However here learns his lesson, then wins.",1
"Other then that, it's pretty good. Luise Rainer is a servant girl who gets married to Muni.",1
"A common formula told with the unique perspective of a Chinese family ( especially for 1937 ) makes the film a classic. Rainers performance is so complete, she is nearly unrecognizable.",1
"With all that help, he succeeds in saving the farm. The newly found wealth transforms Wang Lung.",1
Pearl S. Buck's story did come alive through the magic of the chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school.,1
"Highly recommended for all audiences. * * * * The book like the movie is called "" The Good Earth. """,1
The special effects and costumes are very good for time period.,1
"This is where the term "" classic film "" comes from. Like hell. ( Yeah right, A PEARL!! ) His character is not likeable one to me.",1
The rest of her literary output never matched The Good Earth.,1
I was happily proved wrong.,1
"It is a 10. < br / > < br / > Large scale and touching, what more could a movie lover want! Sure, 65 years have passed since Thalberg's last production was filmed. But as Olan, her use of visual vocal is memorable.",1
The movie is 67 years old. End of story.,1
"Why? So, why isn't this movie out on DVD?",1
"Margaret says, "" We quarreled, and as you rowed away, you turned your face away from me. "" This movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed.",1
They both are in love with him. Jenny wants to help. Chris has forgotten totally about Kitty. Its a delicate story.,1
Walter Matthau and George Burns just work so well together.,1
"She is still a fantastic actress, comedy or drama. Sir Ian Holm has a smaller role as the doctor treating him.",1
Forget Neo and Bourne and all those half - baked made up modern heroes. I rest my case.,1
"When I stood up, I've seen both of these ; and more. In Radivoje Bukvic portrayed Goran well.",1
"After a first - and failed - attempt with a TV show, the real thing begins. The actors are good, so is the scenario, though it might seem too fast.",1
The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy.,1
"( OK, weired example. ) Yet still, I liked it a lot. There is nothing fake or pretentious about them.",1
"< br / > < br / > This is a wonderful, unsung romance. < br / > < br / > Lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry.",1
scene.,1
Every time I see this scene it moves me. Each and everyone of them politely turn him down. They all have plans for their own Christmas eve.,1
"However, Lubitsch's film runs much deeper than that.",1
"Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair. < br / > < br / > All the acting is magnificent. His moment of truth is very moving. Some of her other films are worth catching. Gold stars all round to performers. As Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing.",1
A must see!,1
Lubitsch managed to get best and he obviously gave his best.,1
"THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is one of the sweetest and most feel - good romantic comedies ever made. Their bickering takes them through the next six months, even as they both ( unconsciously, of course! )",1
"Enjoy! Just as good with repeat viewings. """,1
"Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time. He makes himself very scarce. In fact Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda back then. Back in the day of the big studio system, the darndest casting decisions were made. Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife.",1
"A must see for all! This is a truly classic movie in its story, acting, and film presentation.",1
Theirs is one of the classic love stories of cinema. < br / > < br / > Sara Haden graces the small role of a sales clerk.,1
of this film. I also think they were made much better in many ( but not all ) cases. Jimmy Stewart is a special favorite of mine.,1
Don't miss it! A one of a kind film.,1
"A pause. """,1
"William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief. Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. There are so many nuanced performances in this. Very believable in every facet of his role. This is a movie that gets better each time I see it. < br / > < br / > This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though.",1
This is a great example of that. No comparison.,1
"Joseph Schildkraut as the womanising arrogant "" Vadas "" - so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from beginning. Confused?",1
< br / > < br / > That is why these films will live forever!,1
The is certainly the case with Aoki.,1
!,1
< br / > < br / >,1
"The cultural contrasts are thus intriguing. While the music is nice and the dancing colourful, for me the movie is not about dancing. I approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised.",1
"Richard Benjamin shines as Matthau's nephew and agent. < br / > < br / > Matthau : "" Wait, wait. I think you have to slide. "" And, Matthau's bellowing tends to get a little old.",1
< br / > < br / > The story is engaging.,1
See the movie. She is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio.,1
A +.,1
Have to get the DVD I guess. Not sure if I want to. My favorite character must be Mr. Aoki.,1
< br / > < br / > This film is truly keeper.,1
Also I never liked Matthau. For me it's worth seeing for Burns alone. I give it a 7.,1
Pain. < br / > < br / > Sad.,1
Good entertainment! I enjoyed that film as well.,1
This movie was charming.,1
I love it... and I think most people will too. It is a classic in every sense of the word.,1
"and I really loved it. ( "" Dance With Me? """,1
"In instant that it takes his train to pass, he is enthralled by her. This movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog.",1
Okay.,1
Imagine that!,1
"Highly recommended. The dancing is great, too. Truly a well written film.",1
"< br / > < br / > "" Enter!!!!!!!!! """,1
"Instead, there are downfalls, revelations and redemption.",1
Shall we dance?,1
"It definitely deserves 10 stars. Shall We Dansu? "" I understand why some of you dislike this movie.",1
"3. The original Japanese film is touching, subtle and wonderfully acted. I simply love this movie. The remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon. Johnny Stechino - Very funny Italian mistaken identity flic! Monsoon Wedding - I list this first for a reason, outstanding film!",1
Is thisynchronous or what? Yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe.,1
Very entertaining and definitely recommended.,1
Overall a good film.,1
So we went instead to see this movie.,1
Definitely. Scary stuff. Did I enjoy it?,1
"Even the small parts are great. < br / > < br / > Enterrrrr! answer : quietly, deadpan, and with perfect timing as George Burns does here.",1
< br / > < br / > That'just my opinion anyway.,1
"A real classic, ten out of ten!",1
And that's what this film is. There is no Dietrich. This is the third of her European masterpieces. Louise Brooks!,1
"I don't know. I think I truly love this film. """,1
"This is full of major spoilers, so beware. In this early French film, the whole Louise Brooks mystique is fleshed out powerfully with a conjunction of image, song and music. It continues on screen after husband Andre, who has followed her to the screening room, shoots and kills her. Here she has a chance to be charming without the dark side of her Pabst collaboration. What "" Prix "" has that the Pabst films don't is music.",1
A story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely swan whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise.,1
"Fairy - tale, however, turns to tragedy.",1
).,1
"< br / > < br / > Louise Brooks, of course, is responsible for saving film from obscurity. Seeing this makes it only more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last starring role. This is silent film technique at its pinnacle. All of the characters are drawn with nuance.",1
Matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance. The scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and can't get the name of product right is a classic. The problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other.,1
Louise Brooks gives a wonderful performance in this well - made French melodrama. We are all the poorer for that. This is really some of the best stuff of the early days of film.,1
All in all I have seen this film at least 10 times. A sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again.,1
"As another reviewer said, who knew Rathbone could be so funny!",1
Good job by all. And then they discover what they've been doing.,1
).,1
What happens here is pretty hilarious. < br / > < br / > And I do think you will like The Sunshine Boys. Or at least pretty close to as an active performer. < br / > < br / > Burns brought a bit of personal into this film as well.,1
Shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage.,1
"If you have an ounce of passion, and have ever been in love, see this film.",1
Big brawl and Maggie ends up stuck in Panama. Romance. I loved it! Carole and Arthur are great together.,1
Good timing and clever banter at the beginning. Some good singing by Lamour.,1
"It is worth a look. Heck, not even your typical Hollywod movie of any era. Then the temptress arrives in the form of Dorothy Lamour. Enough with plot.",1
"That's an interesting work, believe me.",1
"Mona Lisa "" was the only tune in CAPTAIN CAREY. Most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre.",1
Period. You can literally hear the script crackle.,1
"Iris discovers that Stanley is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen.",1
"Their on - screen marriage near the end 1953 - 54 season captured national even on kinescope. Tony Randall played his brash best friend, history teacher Harvey Weskit. But it's really more a matter of adjusting to the different style. < br / > < br / > "" Mr. Peepers "" is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value.",1
The DVD box is shown on the title page here on IMDb.,1
"It was a must see for the whole family, I believe on Sun. nights. Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on screen.",1
He doesn't get mentioned again.,1
"Yes, the gore is laughable. Yes, it is cheaply made.",1
Believe me! Not a bad word to say about this film really.,1
You will really enjoy it. There are many reasons why I said that. I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as the host.,1
"So he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial. < br / > < But Willie can't remember lines unless they are funny, and keeps flubbing them. The 1976 film starred Walter Matthau as Willie, and George Burns as Al. when Al knocks on the door.",1
Go watch something else!,1
I think I hold this show in good company. And that's part of what makes this show funny. They're obviously being ironic. ).,1
?,1
"Anne Rice is incredible and I ask myself, why is she'symbolically'writing about my family and I'm not. Leza I recommend this movie to everyone.",1
< br / > < br / > 8 out of 10 stars!,1
We have made it a part of our library.,1
"That is to say, they weren't slaves, but they were still exploited to a certain extent.",1
Christ its bad! The prison guard Hank is woeful too.,1
And ends with a bang.,1
Please don't be fooled by the rating by IMDb. This movie is worth it. Reel.,1
It's horror - - but not a splatterfest. 'Camp'is a misreading of the tone of this story. This would be a good choice for Saturday Midnight sit down. That's a red herring. He IS acting here. < br / > < br / > And it is twisty.,1
"< br / > < br / > The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau. The score just plain sucked. There's not much more to say here. < br / > < br / > So what's my holistic grading of this piece? While I honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre, I feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch.",1
Muddled.,1
"I got coconut, pineapple and graham. < br / > < br / > Burns : Maybe later.",1
"I never tire of this fantastic movie. To think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable! From the very beginning, it holds a person's interest.",1
I have been looking for this for years.,1
You will not be sorry. This is why this movie is so appealing.,1
"< br / > < br / > This, like many other movies, is not for everyone.",1
Most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude. It also should be shown more often on satellite movie channels.,1
Definitely not a Rankin - Bass production.,1
"That was a bit far fetched. Original, certainly, but not brilliant.",1
I give a 9 of 10.,1
"Well, so I was.",1
in one of Neil Simon's best plays.,1
"Terry - Thomas underplays this part nicely, as does Sellers in his role as Prime Minister Amphibulos of the tiny country.",1
It even had a decent twist of an ending. So what's with everyone voting it down?,1
"Ultimately, Salva is the victim of his own success in the end. Salva shows he is a natural for the reality show.",1
And almost as disturbing.,1
Brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints ; rather he led them confidently by inspiration. It is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people.,1
He fleashens out the story and the characters. It's just a wonderful film.,1
"Their fate is left unclear regarding her conversion, and one does wonder about polygamy in their case. People came to this country to escape religious persecution, and yet they could not. You can't beat either one for eye candy, however.",1
"Family is high in importance, 4. < br / > < br / > 1.",1
The issue is not emphasized. It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith.,1
"One of the fun bits of information deals with Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the title role.",1
! Together they did a great job.,1
"Sarafina was very entertaining. The fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime. Also, it changes some of the details from other accounts.",1
I bought the video for practically nothing at a videostore.,1
< br / > < br / > Clearly nobody else had either.,1
"I have to say out of all Micheaux's films, Swing is the best! This film reminds me of 42nd Street starring Bebe Daniels and Ruby Keeler.",1
"This simply surpass a five star, I rate it a ten. Thank You. Thank You Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such a astonishing story. If there is a VHS, or DVD out there on the play, Please notify me ASAP.",1
"When people say that Vonnegut is unfilmable, two things come to my mind.",1
"The war ends and the trouble begins. Nolte and Lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as "" a nation of two. "" There's a catch, though. He's beaten senseless by an ex - GI.",1
"It is intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. It is well - told and well - thought out.",1
"It's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime, which is what being a spy in WW2 is really all about. But it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique.",1
It's from Howard's POV.,1
Nolte has a a full range of acting talents. aetv.,1
But the film brought me a pleasant surprise.,1
Does this mean that the movie misses the mark? Of course not.,1
Cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love.,1
com movie database.,1
Mother Night has tight direction and a solid cast. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as always. The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. ). Hard to categorize the film - perhaps it's an avant garde spy thriller?,1
"Sheryl Lee is also excellent, and the same can be said for the whole cast in general.",1
Terrific! What is guilt? These questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years.,1
Very much recommended.,1
"This is a very chilling, and for the most part, a well thought out drama.",1
"< br / > < br / > Campbell was also a very Vonnegut character, portrayed perfectly by Nick Nolte. < br / > < br / > Overall, I was constantly surprised and impressed as I watched this movie. So goes!",1

"Convicts "" is very much a third act sort of film. < br / > < br / > Enjoy. "" Masterson is not necessarily a good director.",1

I recommend it.,1
"whenever Elmer catches him in his bed. In fact, according to Thad, he's channeling Jimmy Stewart ( his "" shy boy "" type personality of that time ).",1
"! However, despite this, this is still a very enjoyable film. This is a very, very early Bugs Bunny cartoon.",1
"An effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt. There's some very clever humour in this film, which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors.",1
"The plot has several interesting twists, and stays suspenseful and uncanny throughout the film. Antiques dealer Michael ( Ray Lonnen ) stumbles over a mysterious old scrying glass.",1
"Whoever said that horror wasn't an educational film genre, huh? Recommended!",1
I wonder if this movie was made for TV?,1
I can not remember the original tale.,1
"The score is remarkable, breezy and pure. Show this movie to your daughters.",1
It was well cast and believable.,1
I thought this was a very good movie.,1

i just could not believe it.,1
"My mom and I watched this film together, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.",1

I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. < br / > < br / > This movie should have gotten more notoriety. However it's on DVD and worth money.,1
7 out of 10 stars I was so surprised by how great The Man In The Moon truly was.,1
Loved it.,1
But elements for this are set up subtly.,1
All the acting is superb.,1
Maureen's character is quite underdeveloped I think. Because she's a few years older? ).,1
"It's intimate and honest, and it sticks to ribs.",1
< br / > < br / >,1
Love story or not.,1
"They yell and argue and Danni leaves. Danni becomes attracted to Court, and Court to Danni.",1
The rest of the cast was very good as well. Jason London does a fine job as well.,1
"The music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene, but never becoming intrusive. This is one of very best films of 1991. * * * * of 4 stars.",1
This show is good.,1
Even Detective Emerson Cod's character has continued to grow in complexity. Guess what?,1
A Modern day Fairy Tale that Brings my Spirits up and Holds my attention throughout the entire show. It was as if Pushing Daisies Brought ABC back to life for me.,1
"Definitely give it a chance, and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are. I couldn't help smiling after every episode I watched.",1
"He first did so with his dog, Digby. He learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight. When Emerson I have loved it since. His father took him to boarding school, and when he left, Ned never saw his father again. That's how they usually solve it.",1
"( Both shows involve an "" undead "" young woman, For example. ) In other words, it's between Ned and Chuck, who was not inclined to forgive Ned anytime soon. There is always next week - - and maybe even next year. ( Yes, I've seen "" Amelie. """,1
"LOST was getting old, way to revitalize prime time. Bravo ABC.",1
Nice movie.,1
"But "" Pushing Daisies "" is more than it's parts.",1
"Best of all, it's not a "" reality "" show.",1
Maybe that's a good thing.,1
Thank god ABC picked this up instead of Fox.,1
"Here we go again, I thought. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. Wow!",1
!,1
Somehow. It's fun. This show is clever.,1
Definitely worth a look. The two aunts are a delight. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults.,1
"If you get chance, watch it.",1
"Olive is the jealous but good - hearted waitress. Oh, and add the dog.",1
What makes this show so unique is the hyper - reality it creates.,1
"in both the overall dead - person - of - the - week plot and in the overriding plot line. And that bringing them back to life was just as routine. It definitely deserves the title of a ( romantic ) comedy / drama. ). On some of the episodes, the plot line was rushed and awkward, making you ask "" what just happened? """,1
"The truly kiss of death. Bryan Fuller, the creator, has an amazing creative mind. He gave her life again and she loves him so much as he does, but this love is untouchable.",1
This is easily best show on television.,1
But you know what? I really liked it.,1
Pushing Daisies was a wonderful show. Don't approach this as a typical TV show.,1
"Realistic, on this show? An escape from the mundane and boring.",1
"How much more sexual tension do you need? < br / > < br / > Bring back! There hasn't been other television quite like it, and I would like to see more. It got me through a flu one crappy week, as it makes for good company.",1
What you will find instead is that they believe the promises Christ made of a resurrection. I know I don't. Too bad. I wish she could have comfort a strong faith gives.,1
I highly recommend this video!,1
< br / > < br / > I give it 7 out of 10. And what do the brusque country squire and his servant know about the situation?,1
"! She's just as good, if not BETTER!",1
"There are lots of them too, by the way. And it was a great introduction. Matthias Hues also did a good job, as always.",1
"Can we add a genre tag for "" so - bad - it's - good ""?",1
The best film of Martial Law series.,1
"Who would not want Mercedes Ruehl as an older sister? The Amati Girls "" is such a movie. It has the aura of reality. One feels such a part of this family!",1
I was impressed by this film.,1
"Artistically, the film looks right. The only scenes shot for "" real "" seem to be those in open fields or forests.",1
"The acting is often more in the style of that period than ours. This is perhaps the least well - known and very probably the best of them. At other times, colors are washed out.",1
"I will watch it for years to come, all three great hours of it. I thought that the creatures were also quite good, also considering how they were made. They will explain the processes used.",1
I sure didn't.,1
!,1
Today B - Movies have larger budgets.,1
Mr. Hines succeeds in doing so.,1
You can poke holes in the plot if you want.,1
What would you do?,1
"Naturally, being a logical creature, Spock turns himself in and arranges a court - martial so that he can justify his actions. < br / > < br / > There's no need to say more about the plot, since the rest will play out in Part 2.",1
Mr. Spock has cleverly commandeered the ship to take it to the forbidden planet Talos IV in order to allow Capt. Pike to get to Talos IV even at risk of Mr. Spock's death. Why the finagling? What a neat thing if this were so!,1
"Or has he simply gone mad? Well, Spock is half human, we tend to forget.",1
The kept her entertained and happy the entire time.,1
He LOVES them. Get over it.,1
"The Doodlebops are energetic, vibrant and appealing.",1
"This is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul. My summation is that if you want to see a powerful, Happy, Sad, beautiful story? 9 < br / > < br / > That rating here is utterly Amazing to me. Or perhaps not. The Acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast.",1
It's well produced with high production values.,1
"Rooney is a great dancer, who cares if he is gay.",1
I really enjoyed this movie.,1
"Otherwise, I don't think I could recommend it.",1
< br / > < br / > Who cares?,1
He had me fooled.,1
"I must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. I thought it was good.",1
"Wow, I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode.",1
It was different. I dropped out of that atmosphere. I call it the Judas Syndrome.,1
"And third, is the humanity of Jesus. When Judas takes his own life, the viewer can sense the angst.",1
"The film makes no claim to "" authenticity "", but the settings and costuming invariably feel more "" right "" than many more highly acclaimed efforts. ( What motivated Judas if money was not the issue? Why did Pilate waffle? )",1
Loved It.,1
"Making the best of what you have is a good thing a well. You are in a situation were you have to choose one or the other. Someone is going to get hurt, there's no stopping that. Love the TV show.",1
i am really mean it. it is suspenseful and exciting.,1
Just classic stuff.,1
!,1
"Oh, yeah, movie.",1
"Flaherty and Levy follow him effortlessly. And to those who just didn't get, well, I can't blame them, too much. No movie has ever done that to me before. I remember it being announced. When this scene came up, I laughed so hard, I peed my pants.",1
"Once in the Life means that once a hoodlum, always a hoodlum, and nobody gets in or out of ` The Life'for free. Often times the dialog comes very fast, much faster than it would on stage, and I think it's the film's biggest flaw.",1
I gave it a 7 / 10.,1
I rated the movie 9 / 10. On video it's OK ).,1
* * * * 1 / 2 * out of * * * * *. This is really a great unknown movie.,1
All of the acting is quite good.,1
Ferdie starts licking Casper on his cheek. And the hunter and dogs are terrified of Casper. Poor Casper sat on a log and weep ; until a little fox cub comes up an nuzzles him.,1
< br / > < br / > You have to give them credit.,1
< br / > < br / > What is so sad about that? Both characters look overjoyed. Did people miss the ending?,1
< br / > < br / > I'd give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars.,1
< br / > < br / > THERE'S GOOD BOOS TONIGHT is a well - animated project - no doubt there.,1
This is the saddest one of all! It's just like seeing Lassie die at end of a movie.,1
"My choice? """,1
"Story is fast - paced. This was a gem. The title "" Love divided "" couldn't capture it any better. Irish countryside is as beautiful as ever. High recommended.",1
"Oh dear. May I have the temerity to state that if Karl Marx saw this movie he'd love it and call it a masterpiece? Well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later I was in a state of shock. Yet another example of "" Oireland "" and religion.",1
Definitely one of my favourite movies. And makes no mistake here.,1
WHAT A GORGEOUS FILM! OH WOW.,1
"Considering it is true, it changes to a horrific tragedy. < br / > < br / > Special note should be given to Orla Brady who plays Sheila.",1
"Unfortunately not everything in life, including religion, are all nice and rosy. In this case both let this family down.",1
Awful. Way better than niece.,1
C'mon man! Really?,1
< br / > < br / > George Lopez is funny. Now there's a bad sitcom...,1
funny show! ha ha george does have big head!,1
Still funny.,1
George Lopez is a funny man even without the sitcom. No one on the cast is really safe from his wit now. This makes both him & the shows progressively funnier.,1
But this movie is a dramatic powerhouse. So what have we? I was all in sweat and needed a shower afterward.,1
< br / > < br / > Well worth your while.,1
The direction is competent and assured. The story is plodding.,1
His soliloquies were breathtaking. Branaugh is one heck of an actor. This leaves no stone unturned.,1
"Kenneth Branagh's "" Hamlet "" hits all the marks. I can't think of many better ways to make four hours fly by.",1
"I didn't know what to expect really. Well, she certainly eradicated all doubts with her performance. Nevertheless, I'll give it a go. She is the best Ophelia I have seen and lent such depth to the character and was simply wonderful.",1
Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is simply genius.,1
There are several scenes of note.,1
"And he gets too hysterical at times. Jack Lemmon ). And the relationship with Ophelia seems a little forced. The thing about the "" secret doors everywhere "", for instance, simply doesn't work. For that, one must delve into the print versions of the plays. All right, so Branagh is a mite too old for the title role. Julie Christie as Gertrude is surely one of the best ever, and even American actors are astounding, esp. ! But that's it.",1
"The only gloom comes from Hamlet himself, as it should. And the cast is incredible, Brannagh the brightest star. Well worth your time, all four hours of it.",1
Astounding. A mesmerizing piece.,1
"What films were they watching? I own a DVD player, and I'd take this over Titanic any day. Like other reviews the 4 hours passes swiftly. I went to see Hamlet because I was in between jobs.",1
I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was.,1
I would recommend this movie to a wide audience. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and King. < br / > < br / > That's my two cents.,1
"Seemed like overkill to me. school. I'm acting! "" < br / > < br / > The rest of cast is top - notch as well. This was my favorite performance of the year by far.",1
Powerful. The language is awesome and passionate. Wow. It was an event.,1
"It was filmed at Blenheim Palace, possibly England's most grandiose stately home, but also a rather forbidding one. The look of the film is particularly striking, both sumptuous and chilly. "".",1
"And of course : "" To be or not to be "". Hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair, Ophelia. < br / > < br / Thus "" Hamlet "" loses its impact as it loses its grip. Branagh has taken on three huge mantels, adapting, directing and playing. Too many of them outstay their welcome.",1
"Everyone knows the story, so I will not spend much time on that. Whatever the reason, this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching "" Hamlet. "" All play their parts equally well. Branagh nailed it. That is not a question that I can answer.",1
"And its also crippled down to 4 : 3 aspect ratio. best - ever! """,1
"Also that that is how people remember them, from their armor.",1
"First, what I didn't like. A lot of the ambiguities in the play were clearly resolved one way in the flashbacks. Branagh was really over - the - top, doing a lot of yelling mostly. The acting was not really up to the Hamlet standard. For example, in King John the English and French have cannons - - in Robin Hood's day.",1
"< br / > < br / > The main stars, of course, are also wonderful. However, I watched and, much to my disturbance, found myself not only paying attention, but actually enjoying the movie too. Kenneth Branagh excels as Hamlet, bringing not only the confusion and pain required to the roll, but also a sort of sardonic air which plays beautifully in the comic scenes, making the movie as a whole much more watchable. The other major players are also good, but it is Kenneth Branagh who stands head and shoulders above the rest in the title role.",1
"It is a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding. All of these part of William Shakespeares greatest triumph. < br / > < br / > This is a must see for everyone who enjoy's good story telling, brilliant acting, and incredible direction.",1
"Branagh's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise. In his portrayal of Hamlet here he might be accused of that again, but there is a method at work.",1
Branagh is phenomenal in the leading role.,1
It is presented in a way that one does not have to be an English Literature Ph. D to understand and enjoy it. His dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded.,1
Hugh is smitten. Nevermind.,1
"Orlando Bloom was fantastic as Joe, playing the role of quiet, loyal ladiesman very well. < br / > < br / > Regardless of a few flaws, this is a moving film, which stirs all sorts of emotions. ( Great job, Heath! )",1
Good ones.,1
There are so many funny sketches. if you like twisted black comedy then this is for you. if you like keeping up appearances it probably isn't. it's so silly it's genius.,1
The Christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for Christmas.,1
"A weird, witty and wonderful depiction of family life! com is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in shops. Veoh.",1
Predictable?,1
"The movie rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after jumping about quite a bit. And that is exactly what'Moon Child'is, and more. The superstars as actors have their flaws, and so do their characters. Lee - Hom Wang also shines as the vengeful'Son'who becomes friends with a grown - up Sho.",1
"< br / > < br / > On a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. Shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it. It's just a movie with a vampire in it.",1
"Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces.",1
"... would probably be the best word to describe this film ( in my opinion ). it was Taro Yamamoto, boy # 5 from battle Royale! hurray for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt!",1
"This movie surprised me! But "" Moon Child "" isn't an action movie! But it just is!",1
< br / > < br / > Man..,1
I think that it's a really good movie to watch.,1
It's a good film with a touchy story inside.,1
Moon Child was one of the more symbolic movies I've seen.,1
"Moonchild is a very difficult movie to categorise. Which, I suppose, brings me to the lead actors. < br / > < br / > The other area that really stood out to me is the languages.",1
This movie is amazing.,1
Tragedy claims still others.,1
< br / > < br / > Wrong! I just wanted to check it out. !,1
"In fact, this film greatly exceeded my expectations. I was not disappointed.",1
A lot of angst. Beautifully done.,1
DON'T MISS IT!,1
It also explains that Sho and Son have become enemies. Hyde did an amazing job for a first timer.,1
The way they met up was quite cool indeed.,1
"Dreading it. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. He's one of my two major beefs with the film itself.",1
"All in their original languages, of course! < br / > < br / > This is must see.",1
It's a very beautiful movie.,1
such was Ned's Bravery. ',1
"So, give them some credit.",1
Came up with nothing.,1
I would definitely recommend it to everyone.,1
I didn't even see much of subtext. At least rent it since it's coming to Region 1.,1
I give this movie two thumbs so far up. The characters all had human traits.,1
"However, with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day. < br / > < br / > Overall, a great addition that was very refreshing.",1
"It's awesome! 9 / 10. In Story Mode, your going from punk to pro.",1
"These two genuine artists are at their very best, as is the story line. This is what I call a "" pre Sci Fi ; Sci Fi "" movie. No way.",1
!,1
"The contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark. The Invisible Ray "" is part science fiction and part horror. < br / > < br / > Rukh goes to Benet for help. Diana and Ronald accompany him.",1
"The film lacks pace, but is always absorbing.",1
"The rest of the performances are also good, if not particularly worth mentioning.",1
"Recommended, much like ALL old Universal horrors...",1
Still I did like this.,1
The film does get off to a rather slow start ; but things soon start to pick up.,1
A grade A effort by Universal. I guess that ’ s mark of a good piece of art. Lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed. No skimping on the loads of extras and locations.,1
"This light can do harm, or it can be harnessed to do good.",1
"No, I am not making that up. About the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the Irish versus English mentality of the battles. The more the stories try to portray Kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention. < br / > < br / > Heath Ledger does an amazing job of impersonating Australia's most notorious outlaw.",1
"< br / > < br / > This film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet - - whose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds French. However, despite this unusual twist, the two still did excellent jobs. ).",1
"Their The Invisible Ray "" features three main chapters.",1
Dr. Benet ( Bela Lugosi ) form an expedition led by Rukh to locate the element.,1
"In "" The Body Snatcher "", Karloff does kill Lugosi, but Lugosi is trying to blackmail him. < br / > < br / > What he gets is a disaster.",1
"Of course, it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen, and the movie that united them was 1934's "" The Black Cat "".",1
The acting is marvelous and science is amusing. I highly recommend it.,1
What I'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot.,1
But no can forget it.,1
Karloff and Lugosi - Together again! Same here. There isn't any real transformation.,1
< br / > < br / > The movie tells the story of Ned Kelly's life. I really enjoyed this movie and I give it a 7.,1
Robert Wagner played his role good. Fatal Error is a really cool movie!,1
The movie wasn't all that great. Overall I'd give the movie a 7 or 8. The book is better.,1
"It'really good, no really, it is! < br / > < br / > watch it.",1
"Actually, I have to say there all my favourite. This show brings back a lot of memories, happy ones. Pepe is cool, I always loved him.",1
Maybe it IS love? Bank on it. < br > < br / > A classic.,1
"Red and Miyoshi themselves deserve their Oscars especially Red with his defiant and proud emotions throughout. Bailey himself is dating one of the dancers, Fumiko - San ( Reiko Kuba ).",1
"I feel that in this case, this is the only limitation. There are few films that leave me with the feeling that Gregor Jordan's'Ned Kelly'film did. It certainly inspired me to look more closely. For me, I'd call it a breath of fresh air! So, watch it and decide for yourself. It is also wonderful to see something Australian! Maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an Australian audience?",1
"It portrays true love and passion, and not just "" heat. "" However, when judged from the prospective of 1925 America, he was fantastic.",1
Any thoughts? Civil Rights was in it's infancy. Anyone who has been in Japan would understand. The Jim Crow laws were still in effect.,1
A mostly underrated gem.,1
Today gays in the military is a big issue. But the picture is stolen by the orientals here. < br / > < br / > Sayonara is a relevant film today.,1
"In spite of the efforts of governments and some historians, Ned Kelly has become a legend. I enjoyed it.",1
?,1
She died before this movie but how? Other than that I give it two thumbs / tails up!,1
"Poppycock, I say. This has been played so often that it's starting to skip ; no joke!",1
"The script is intelligent and economical. Forgivable - keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book. I was particularly impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed. < br / > < br / > The film is a little unevenly paced.",1
< br / > < br / > Give Blood Today God Bless!,1
< br / > < br / > It's just so wonderful and fun to view.,1
A must see for anyone.,1
John Brambury was also a Munchkin. But as a kid I enjoyed it.,1
"Rose was really in love with Jimmy's good friend happy go lucky Fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her. Smug and sure of himself, and his ability to shoot a gun, Jimmy had become a top mobster in New York City's underworld!",1
to mention a few.,1
"< br / > < br / > I'd love to get a copy of it to view it again. People are being too hard on the film. Then the fun begins as everyone about him also "" go down "".",1
The people Tagge represents are never revealed. The allusions to J. F. K.'s killing are unmistakable. ).,1
This is a great movie. This is the clue! All can be done just by delegation. There is no special agency involved in the plot.,1
< br / > < br / > So does Wallace. It's a good offbeat film.,1
"So, Wallace steps in and the fun begins.",1
That seems impossible to say least.,1
It's a good one at that.,1
He's learned to shoot by now and he does a Sergeant York. I think you can figure the rest out.,1
The people who are bad - mouthing this film are those who don't understand film to begin with.,1
"I absolutely loved it! It's truly "" Cinematic "".",1
But I love that. factor ALONE makes it a film treasure.,1
"< br / > < br / > Bravo! Joyce's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy, it offers many wildly "" perverse "" episodes.",1
Great fun. Very amusing to see him dance! My daughter was entranced.,1
"B. Rangi was like a wise ). I thought they were being hypocritical, and said so.",1
"He would always shout "" Shuddup!!!!! This is probably due to a question of taste : This is seen as being crude. < br / > < br / > It is about A concert band in India.",1
I appreciate this flowing film very much.,1
: ) I will always be a fan of show.,1
Don't we all wish we could do that. An A + ending to an A + show!!! !,1
Give this series the ending it deserves.,1
Here's hoping the ABC's DVD department gets its act together. < br / > < br / > A great series which has aged remarkably well. < br / > < br / > Wildside is currently being repeated late at night on the ABC.,1
I was amazed at her performance. Release it so all can enjoy!,1
Why has this not been released? How wrong can a girl be!,1
! Ask yourself would you do it. oh boy!,1
This story is still an original plot. Timon and Pumbaa travel along looking for ideal place to live.,1
I was like ok there we go again.,1
Some of the questions are actually difficult. < br / > < br / > The voice talents are excellent. My favorite part is when they show the pair raising Simba.,1
"We find out what made Timon and Pumbaa decide to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to oust Scar. And we find out how they dealt with the hyena's once and for all. Having said that, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg reprising their roles.",1
"They start the new movie, and the laughs begin. 1 1 / 2 "" decides to try something different : It tells the original story from a new point of view. Everyone does well, especially Robert Guillame ( is that how you spell it? )",1
Disney have done it again.,1
"< br / > < br / > However some parts don't fit. Of course that's a good thing. In this movie, they are not!",1
: ),1
"< br / > < br / > 3. During the climax, some of the jokes becomes lame. The score is quite good. Many of scenes from the first film are used in this one. Yes, there is.",1
"Which classic tale, you ask? Why,'The Lion King'of course! It's not what happens, it's how.",1
It's got a good story and is very funney! 10 out of 10!,1
I was wrong. It was very funny. I found it to be very good.,1
"But this was no problem, it had subtitles. It's a special purpose sub. It's all good.",1
It's a fun flick with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first. Sit back and just think Hakuna Matata! It means no worries!,1
"The sing, they entertain, and they make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with warthog.",1
"On the way he meets Pumba, another outcast and they become friends.",1
"It's all harmless fun, good for kids and some adults.",1
"The toe - tapping opening feature of'Dig A Tunnel'is well choreographed and hilarious. This is done with frequent comedic interruptions. Timon and Pumba's take on the Lion King's opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing. Lion King 1 1 / 2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. The newer, independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original. < br / > < br / > Overall, worth purchasing.",1
"My Take : A funny take on THE LION KING, posing as a sequel. Maybe not now, but go watch it for yourself. < br > < br / > So doesn't this sound fun. It's kinda like MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa. Surprisingly amusing.",1
It deserved a theatrical release. The scenes never seem out of place.,1
).,1
"At least LK2 had the nice ballad, "" Love Will Find a Way. "" People just love these characters! Most of the time, I found myself embracing the latter. < br / > < br / > The Lion King 1½ definitely has its cute and funny moments. As for the voicework, it was well done in this movie.",1
The characters were vivid and well - acted. Lemon is in middle.,1
Truly this is a'heart - warming'film. I won't'spoil'this movie for you.,1
com I would really appreciate it. I was right.,1
Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes.,1
Rating reflects movie content.,1
And what'even more boring?,1
Why? One of the best movies I have ever seen.,1
Hickory Dickory Dock was a good Poirot mystery. 7.,1
That's right.,1
"< br / > < br / > So, the plot is fairly simple. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. R. I. P. Stanley.",1
"At this point, we know something is going to happen, but don't know when and how. They are not alone in this place.",1
"It really is great. So go on Netflix, and get it! ! Not really. The kid is psychic.",1
This is due to two factors : Stanley Kubrick's masterful direction and Jack Nicholson's chilly acting.,1
"At times, this overtakes The Thing as my favourite horror film. I disagree. He becomes irritable, angry, on edge. He's calm, quiet, patient. From then on, all bets are off. We're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening.",1
It has infinite depth. He loves to perplex his watchers everyone of his films. Red is used in EVERY scene. This is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so. < br / > < br / > I will be talking about this film for months to come. Nothin '.,1
The pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long & keeps you interested throughout.,1
Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd standout among the group. It's just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked. It's a fun little play on the Hickory Dickory Dock title. It's up to Poirot to bring a killer to justice.,1
Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic. ...,1
! < br Kubrick's genius is like magic.,1
"And of course, the bathroom scene. Heck, even King himself didn't fare so bad.",1

"Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie.",1
"The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well - acted, and had a great story. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent.",1
"This film is a perfect example of this very thought. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway.",1
"< br / > < br / > Humour was much more prevalent in these early Poirots. Altogether though, a solid entry in the series though not one of best.",1

More problematic is the incoherency.,1

"Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith is Lavelle, in prison for life for murdering a scumbag whose relative was a Senator. Belle becomes the obsession of Randolph who promises Superintendent McQueen ( Steele ) that through a surgical procedure he can remove her violent tendencies. Boy, it sure contained the elements I expected, and delivered so much more. She's the one all the girls fear to cross. Roberta Collins is Belle, a serial kleptomaniac, best pals with Pandora ( Ella Reid ). Drugging her up, Randolph takes nude pictures and sodomizes her, whimpering like a little girl due to his own mental deficiencies while hugging her naked body in his arms. Lavelle receives work in Randolph's office and is one responsible for relating his dirty antics to Pandora.",1
"In fact, he is a little too ambitious for his own good. The cast is good.",1

Wonderful memories.,1
"The bird lifted Perry to paradise. Strangely, Perry says that he has an aversion to Nuns, God and Religion. I saw this film after watching Capote and Infamous. She is holding a horse. Cutter on the phone is matched - cut to Perry on the phone. The reporter is straight, the protagonists are more beatniks than gay. Perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later on. The decision seals her fate.",1

The rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth remarking on. Brooks turns killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them.,1
"Why Wilson didn't go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me. < br / > < br / > This is a solid movie, scary every time you see. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie.",1

The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote.,1
Whidbey Too bad there have to be commercials. were very realistic. Thank you! Loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager. Looking forward to the next films - - - when? Many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter.,1

I agree!,1
"< br / > < br / > GFT, Amazon Reviewer Strong stuff - - and recommended. This is the film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests, and deservedly so. Given the overall power of film, however, this becomes a trivial annoyance. The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD. As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less fine.",1
"! In Cold Blood "" centers on the element of unexplained... However, this incident takes place in 1959!",1
Easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century. < br / > < br / > Robert Blake walks away with the film.,1
"The story ended in 1965. These aren't good people, but they aren't necessarily monsters either, at least all the way through.",1
"Watch Dick and They seem so real. - - just fantastic. A unique film... one of the best of all time. < br / > < br / > The cops are wonderful too. Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing.

Then the hanging scene. Robert Blake is excellent as Perry. There is much to remember from this film. Great job by each of them.,1
"Of course, Mitzi ROCKED!",1
See it on DVD.,1
"As I have matured, my fascination with the Academy Awards has evolved from intense interest to casual amusement. While there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen, the film is definitely adult material. The Clutter family was apparently not researched to the same depth. Scott Wilson is all cold charm and Robert Blake intense introversion as the two killers. This lack of balance comes from the book as Capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row. As a child star, Blake sold the lottery ticket to Bogart in that John Huston film. )",1
These two truly enhance each other.,1
"The flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done. These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience. < br / > < br / > As a stand alone film from it's era, "" In Cold Blood "" is top notch in every way. First, and most chillingly, is the fact that it's star, Robert Blake, was recently on trial for murdering his wife. Many of the stills from this film of the Kansas farm house at night or the tree - lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography. Second, the recent Oscar winning biopic, "" Capote "" showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author, Truman Capote. Most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall ( later of "" American Beauty "" and "" Road to Perdition "" fame ).",1
"The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of Hickok and Smith. in this instance, these needs carried right through to the murder of the Clutters. They push each other along a road of "" proving "" something to each other.",1
It excels in every department. Blake and Wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo.,1
"But this is no dream. Sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway. The events really happened, in 1959.",1
"We don't see that much blood being spilled in these scenes, but we don't need to. Two months on the run, including an aimless "" vacation "" in northern Mexico, ended in Las Vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car.

From the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction. < br / > < br / > Raymond Massey does a great job as Nathan the prophet.

This is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with their buckle.,1
But his eyes catch sight of Bathsheba out in her garden one evening. He even lays hands on the Ark of the Covenant which was an instant death as seen in film. Turns out she's as unhappily married to Uriah the Hittite as David is to quite a few women. I liked Kieron Moore's performance as Uriah is one of David's army captains.,1
"And somehow I doubt a bored David ever told the prophet Nathan "" Whatever you say. "" He even tries the old "" My kingdom doesn't understand me "" routine on desperate housewife Bathsheba at one point. Maybe it's the censor - baiting nature of the plot a married man kills a femme fatale's husband and gets away with it!",1
To me movies and acting is all about telling a story. As well as the sadness when he was killed in battle. I gave it a rating of ten.,1

"great movie. and I loved it! But they don't depress, but rather inspire. Let me just say it truly captures the spirit of movie. < br / > < br / > The movie has its serious moments. Not the typical confrontation ( which in itself was awesome ), but well, you'll see.",1
This film has to be viewed in the right frame of mind. < br / > < br / > That leaves us with the comedy. Chan wants to make an historical romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it. But there's plenty of slapstick as well.,1

"It might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others. It remains the sum of its parts. Story - wise, it seems like something a few film students could put together. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. The shorts don't exactly relate but they all have something in common, love.",1
"This review is not meant to deter anyone from watching this movie, as everyone's opinion on art differs. For example, many of the skits involve well to do middle aged whites. You will never know until you see it for yourself. < br / > < br / > The Good : The city of New York.",1

"That's basically a nitpick. There are continuity problems, over and over. In time, the killing was reduced. Mark Twain was 24 years - old in 1859.",1
But every writer should have some leeway with the truth.,1
Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name. But that's if Bonanza were done today. I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys.,1
"Western Movies were so popular that Western Television Shows followed suit!! ! Certainly, my entire family loved "" Bonanza ""!",1
"Also, trips away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so forth. Bonanza is still infinitely re watchable in re runs. Needless to say, few of these excursions pass uneventfully. The characters are all very well drawn. These three brothers have different mothers, all of whom have passed away years earlier.",1
"Long live the Cartwrights. Over the years I have learned many things about him. I lost my father at a very young age. On behalf of my late father, who is not here to say so himself, we love Bonanza. I can remember this as though it were yesterday.",1

"Cinderella "" is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics. Their antics intertwine generally with the main fairy - tale plot, and are for the most part wonderful. < br / > < br / > The animation and art direction is lovely. The mice Jaq and Gus are the main sidekicks, and their own nemesis being the stepmother's cat Lucifer. And it really deserves its status. """,1
< br / > < br / > THE PLOT : Cinderella is a nice girl who can't catch a break.,1
"The characters are also a delight. It is a lovely looking film, with gorgeous animation. are standouts. 9 / 10. A dream is a Wish and So this is love?",1
"This film is about a magical fairytale. Of course, Cinderella didn't get to go, but her stepsisters did.",1
"The animal friends tend to grate, especially that idiotic Gus. She never works for her dreams that she sings so fondly of. We never know. The story is older than the English language and somehow it still rings true. Ilene woods has a lovely, rich voice, probably my favorite of any Disney heroine. Cinderella herself was no pushover - making some justly catty remarks at times. I would have cheered had he met his fate in Lucifer's jaws. However, she just lacked drive to make her entirely sympathetic.",1
she has hope that one day she'll find her prince.,1
But it sure is true classic.,1
Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairytale. I consider the film to have been the greatest of his films at the time of its release.,1
The acting was great ; loved the mice!! I can watch it over and over again.,1
"< br / > < br / > It's not among Disney's top works, but is satisfying. The Grand Duke is a very cool chap and funny too. If this was a failure, there wouldn't be any more Disney animated classics. Really has that mouse - like quality. I love his voice. Gus might not be that smart, but he's humorous. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them.",1
"Thank you, Disney, for doing us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie. It's a shame they had to cheapen it with all the marketing for what looks to be a lame follow - up. < br / > < br / > But of course, the original "" Cinderella "" still maintains its magic, and the story is still good one, though we've all seen it countless times.",1
In this film it's even more the magical when her rainbow comes smiling. The villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile. Of course in the real world some are believers others are hoper's. The magic remains.,1
"The film's suspense, however, is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness, especially in musical numbers. Overall, Walt Disney's CINDERELLA is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century. Disney's artists provide the film with an appealing storybook look that emanates delectable fairy tale atmosphere. It is this menace that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the viewers'interest.",1
"I like to showcase Disney to them as much as I can, and we recently watched "" Cinderella "" together. < br / > < br / > Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney. I wanted "" Dumbo, "" but my sisters won out, and we got "" Cinderella. "" < br / > < br / > A lot has changed since then.",1
"You'll just have to find out. You can't help but fall in love with this masterpiece. Cinderella was one of my favorites because I always was so enchanted by the story. When the prince sees Cinderella at the ball, he has fallen hard for her.",1
"I wonder how he put up with the animal. ) ( Although he, of course, is richer. ) The animation varies a bit.",1

"Sister Evelyn would be the obvious culprit, but she moved to the States recently... Or has she? What more could you possibly request? Some classy and tasteful nudity, perhaps? That latter one is truly one of the greatest ( = most gruesome ) acts of violence I've ever seen!",1
Should this be an American movie I'd rate it 7 : we've seen this before. That's when the real action begins.,1
"Diaz has been suspended from duty, but he's the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated. All in all, a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither panders to lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence.",1
"I sit through movies like "" Tiempo de valientes "" and I want to talk about cinema for hours. Trapero's film was a journey into a man's mind and experiences, not into the places he saw.",1
It seems the script suits perfectly to the actors and vice versa. I really believe with a film making like this Argentina is really up to Competition.,1

Great Classic 1945 film without Humphrey Bogart.,1
"This enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast, and many memorable scenes. The big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents.",1
Mood is used to great affect - I especially liked the fog scene. Bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film. < br / > < br / > Bacall is just gorgeous. No accent whatsoever. There is great tension and it moves along well enough. Not great chemistry - and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still really liked this picture.,1
"Seymour wasn't a small actor. Conclusion : Bacall is somewhat miscast. Uh, no. The two have no chemistry. < br / > < br / > Paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful.",1
"Graham Greene has been translated into film many times of course, in such masterpieces as "" Thin Man "" and in lesser vehicles. "" What good is love in the face of death? The lack of glitz, of "" bubble, "" of narrative "" bounce "" help to make this movie very worthwhile. I know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull, and I can understand that. Yet I found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is claustrophobic world. What is a thief?",1
"It could have been a better film. The local diplomat, Licata ( Victor Francken ) is already a willing associate of the Falangists. She's an aristocrat - the daughter of a Press lord.",1
She does her best. Not without reservations. The character wants to be helpful.,1
In war there is no substitute for victory.,1
"The movie "" MacArthur "" begins and ends at Gen. Douglas MacArthur's, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata the US Military Academy of West Point on the Hudson. That he'll return and return with the might of the US Army & Navy to back up his pledge! Told by his The General did that suffering far less US Military losses then any other allied commander in the War in the Pacific!",1
"Not that Universal's "" MacArthur "" is bad. < br / > < br / > Oddly enough, the potential was there. It's just not all it should have been.",1
The film opens with MacArthur addressing the student body in 1962.,1
Well worth watching.,1
"I think that this criticism is a At times, he even seems to be a man of the political left. Like a previous reviewer, I am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other. Gregory Peck dominates this film even more than George C. Scott dominated ` Patton '. I suspect that in real life General MacArthur was as volcanic an individual as Patton, but that is not how he appears in this film. < br / > < br / > The main difference, however, lies in the way the two leaders are played. It is as if Atticus Finch from ` To Kill a Mockingbird'had put on a general's uniform.",1
"This movie had a good dose of them. The rest all is typical Bollywood screen writing. Zanzeer saw the making of Angry Young Man. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a one man industry. But this is a caper, remember?",1
It will easily give it 10 / 10. The best thing is the laughter never stops.,1
"Then I spotted Full Moon's latest offering, Demonicus. Anyway... < br / > < br / > Demonicus chronicles what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the Alps. All good movies "" inspire "" some direct to video copycat flick. The weapons, although apparently real, look really plastic - y.",1
The music even sounds like video games. The normal stuff!,1
This may not be casualty. I watched it some years ago.,1
Macy and Sutherland are the stand - outs here.,1
Macy is excellent as the depressed Alex.,1
Brilliant work all round.,1
"His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next assignment, he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist. In fact, it moves very slowly.",1
"At one point Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry. Thematically, this union is less coincidence, more the work of fate. < br / > < br / > William H. Macy, as Alex, is as convincing as always. This performance, however, may be an eye - opener for many.",1
"This movie displays the kind of ensemble work one wishes for in every film. And finally, there's Sammy ( David Dorfman ). Macy, Campbell, Ullman, and Ritter are also terrific. When are the powers that be in Hollywood going to wake up?",1
The basic dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded.,1
Beautiful.,1
"But the film works. dark, but not obnoxiously so.",1
And the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating.,1
And he's going to have to do it very soon.,1
Go get it.,1
"This is the kind of movie Hollywood needs to make more of. Son wants out of the business, father won't let him. Just people dealing with being people.",1
"He shows a maturity beyond his years. David Dorfman, is a delight in film.",1
Who knew? Macy is such a great actor.,1
"When he meets a young woman ( Campbell ) he feels invigored and decides it's time to quit the family business. Brommel's script feels like a Shakespearean tragedy, with a definite theme of destiny running throughout. In his middle - age, he becomes increasingly disgusted with what he has done all his life.",1
That is really sad.,1
I like the idea of SIX DEGREES...,1
Why is this? The whole concept is gripping viewing!,1
"Sure, it isn't always true, but... It is the one that got canceled before the end of first season.",1
This deserves a 12 out of 10.,1
"Great! First of all, the characters. < br / > < br / > Then, the cast. Oh man, why? """,1
Big kudos to all the cast.,1
PetitionOnline.,1
"In meantime, I'm viewing it on ABC's website from the beginning.",1
"That has been the most disappointing aspect. It caught be my surprise, as it was a break from listening to anything Chinese.",1
"That is definitely so not true and very, very sad. What was explored was done well, for the most part. That wasn't too great. Oh well. Yeah, would have gotten more in, been able to explore some more emotion.",1
The casting was spectacular! ! I want that last show!,1
We want to watch what we can! ). This show is totally worth watching. It has the best cast of talent I have seen in a very long time.,1
Wonderful show. Thanks for reading.,1
I am SO sorry to see go! Will the series go on video? Thank God for that.,1
PetitionOnline. I personally like every character.,1
WAY too much drama. This could be one of the best shows of all time. I'm addicted.,1
What happened? Six degrees had me hooked.,1
it sucks.,1
Is it Franziska ( Marina Malfatti )?,1
"The action, the stakes, the plot.",1
Performances throughout are nearly faultless - even Julia Styles begins to offer something more than book - wormy eye - candy. Can Bourne finally find the answers he has been looking for or will his old employers silence him for good?,1
But that doesn't slow it down.,1
"I doubt that. "" Its all about the action.",1
This movie was excellent. They never treat the audience like idiots.,1
Ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front. Jason Bourne is played very well by MattDamon.,1
< br / > < br / > And secondly ( inevitably ) - the SHAKY CAMERA. < br / > < br / > 8 / 10. This sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull. Very unrealistic. He crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something!,1
"These sequences add realism to the film in feeling. In reality, perhaps they are.",1
So go and watch film. A woman and the Senate ; read my lips.,1
"Madeline Zima was decent, if not overly memorable, as the teen - aged Lucy.",1
How they got around that?,1
"And the action scenes are rather impressive. Yeah, Jason Bourne is back, and this time, he's here with a vengeance. Jason Bourne is a Captain - America project - like, who's gone completely wrong.",1
I wasn't disappointed. This movie felt choppy at times. Unless Do some framing. It basically makes the movie a half - prequel. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. Obviously there are only two originals left.,1
"< br / > < br / > Hoo boy, does Ultimatum have suspense!",1
This movie is awesome. He is this role.,1
"< br / > < br / > Secondly, it is a silly malarky of cartoonish super - hero stuff. < br / > < br / > Joan Allen plays what appears to be the Good Cop against Strathairn's Bad One.",1
The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off. It goes further to play the anti - Bond theme. They aren't his target. Or does it? Bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past.,1
"It sticks to what works and adds a little more. Right.. moving on. This allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. Please, oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. The fights between Bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch.",1
Well done. I look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future. < br / > < br / > Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne.,1
The Bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper - reality that is full of technological - based magic.,1
"Lucy didn't fit mold of the old studio system. My response to that is, "" So what? "" I couldn't believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally. She is a chameleon who can play ( and sing ) anything!",1
Come on it was not that bad at all.,1
So I went out and bought both the original movies. And boy did Bourne Ultimatum not disappoint!,1
"With that said, the Bourne series has been fantastic. It has been the CIA who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them.",1
< br / > < br / > It's just so intense.,1
"This time, it ends.",1
"I don't hand out ten star ratings easily. However for me, that last one was never a problem. I think it adds to the suspense. Paul Greengrass has done it again.",1
I loved this movie.,1
"Thanks to Julie Newmar to re - living a villain role, also. ! At the end Frank Gorshin makes an appearance. He didn't lose his touch!",1
Let's hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on DVD.,1
"Xica da Silva "" is definitely a must. Martin, the diamond commender's son, swears vengeance. I wish I could buy the whole series on DVD. etc.",1
I had an urge to see the caped crusader. I'm gonna watch it again. All kids need some kind of hero. ! They play themselves as they played their parts in the series.,1
< br / > < br / > Q,1
"This is told in flashback. Adam West and Burt Ward reunite as themselves. I'm glad I did. But, in a way, they were acting as their "" Batman and Robin "" selves.",1
I loved this movie.,1
"It was funny, well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show. Brett Rickaby ( "" Frank Gorshin It was very well done. The casting ( as in "" Surviving "" ) is excellent.",1
It was also great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin.,1
These have mixed results. There are many kinds of reunion shows.,1
We need it released again to Telemundo.,1
They're all alright.,1
She looks good without make up too. ).,1
"That 70s Show is the best TV show ever, period. It is a basic continuation of the First. < br / > < br / > Well, the First Season is great. They also play a major role in the show's story. Kitty is just the opposite.",1
"If TV was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record!",1
I love this show. Randy is horrible. = ] Period.,1
Not this one though. The following seasons the character where fledged out.,1
Even down to homosexuality.,1
"I haven't liked many TV shows post 1990, but THAT 70S SHOW is great. The humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable.",1
He is a town playboy. The group Pervert. Hmm what i forget? His from India. I like it. And there's FeZ. It was dam Funny! His one big pussy.,1
"< br / > < br / > Its all round classic I mean the cast, the writers, the director, its just a recipe for success.",1
Dumbass!,1
They should make new episodes. Please come back...,1
No other show does camera tricks like this. < br / > < br / > Overall this is a very funny sitcom.,1
""", that always makes me laugh.",1
That 70's Show is a great example.,1
I am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series. ... and the series lets you forget all that. Then there are the parents.,1
Will highly recommend : )...,1
I would give 4 out of 10. I don't know how you can like this show. Its humor is pathetic! ( Sorry for my poor English again. ),1
Finally a show for everyone to enjoy.,1
"They also brought in the standard cousin Oliver, only this time it just wasn't a kid. I think more than half of the last season was Donna pretending to be amused. It just didn't really connect, it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn't even funny.",1
!,1
This was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television. Season 8 was the real problem kicked in. The actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point. Without Topher grace or Ashton Kutcher the show simply fell apart.,1
You are the best! This show has come so far.,1
"Not only that, she is homesick and wants to return to Japan. It's a rather sad love story with a killer 80s techno - nintendo soundtrack. It's not that she doesn't like Ken, it's just that she's used to a whole'nother way of life.",1
Ha!..,1
< br / > < br / > A very promising first film.,1
"More, please. Debut?",1
Cross Eyed is a rare gem. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next. Very funny stuff.,1
Dreams are what you make of them. Anyway liked it.,1
Definitely worth seeing! Even the peripheral roles are well written and well acted.,1
If you've had a terrible roommate. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot.,1
Bravo! I can't wait for his sophomore effort.,1
< br / > < br / > Put on your seat belt. I love this film? Without that a comedy is just a bunch of ideas. They sneak up on you. Who cares.,1
Overall Xica merits a 10 out of 10! It is a very entertaining novela which is set in Brazil.,1
< br / > < br / > The standouts where the actors. I also really liked the vigilante duo. Ridiculous and funny. Well done to Adam Jones crew.,1
Definite a must see.,1
Worth a look for those seeking something different. George regains his health and goes back to work.,1
"It actually has a story, and it is very romantic indeed. It is simply how it is done in her world. Classic drama. Emy will remain a virgin until she is married, to a man she has never met.",1
"Vera - Ellen is that dancer and - wow, what legs! A few years ago, I bought several $ 1 DVD's that contained two movies each.",1
"Oh hell. Not sappy, not contrived, not melodramatic. But it's really so much more.",1
So who delivered the laughs for me? Good Stuff!,1
A triumph.,1
It's like watching a movie and getting a Laurel & Hardy short with it for free.,1
"Yes, this gets the full ten stars.",1
"If you are in the mood for making fun of someone this is definitely the film to watch. Oh, my. When it was over, I had to rewind the film to once again watch the real Gary and all his shining idiocy.",1
This movie HAS to be seen to be believed! He's an incredibly nice guy to boot.,1
This movie is amazing for several reasons.,1
"If you are a Sean Penn fan, you must see this. If you are a Crispin Glover fan, you must see this. It is its own genre. But I really wish someone would put this onto a DVD.",1
< br / > < br / > A film not to miss. I loved it. < br / > < br / > Jacob.,1
"They just... conflict with each other. I know, I have a lot to say ), in the movie, the guys snort coke instead of smoking hash. But in the TV series, they've supposedly only been in jail for 18 months. But some actors portray totally different characters. < br / > < br / > Also ( again...",1
"One year later, the red lady left her grave. A fight ensues.",1
Brilliant. TV how TV should be.,1
I highly recommend it!,1
Kurt doesn't talk much.,1
"However, i'll try.",1
"At least, that's part of Sjoman's aim here.",1
< br / > < br / > I'll give this one 3 out of 5.,1
!,1
"There is action in it, but that's not really what it's about. But, again, that's not what it's about.",1
"What a perfect example of "" Less Is More... "" Kurt Russell ( Sgt. What a challenge! Todd ) only has 72 lines, and something like 104 words.",1
3 or so stars.,1
Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self - reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise.,1
in the storyline.,1
"Todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a loner. Fear and Discipline we are told. Always.",1
Jason Scott Lee being one of them. This is a great movie. For a while he lives there but can't adjust to normal life. Russell obviously comes out on top.,1
).,1
"His robot becomes human, in spite of the constraints. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly, and gorgeous. Yes!",1
And you know what it worked.,1
I only saw it when it came onto cable. < br / > < br / > Always.,1
"It is almost a mime performance. Jason Scott Lee is brutish as a "" superior "" genetic soldier. There are flaws.",1
Not surprisingly so have all of his other movies!,1
"He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes.",1
I don't think you will be disappointed. ).,1
"Just don't expect the next Bladerunner. For me, this made the movie worth the time it took to watch.",1
I noticed btw that IMDB has got wrong information about Sanna.,1
"But overall, its worth watching.",1
The film improves so stick with it. The last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving.,1
"Well, this is what is happening.",1
I was particularly impressed by two episodes.,1
"Thirdly, there is the plot. Why do I like DISORGANIZED CRIME so much? ).",1
"Comedy. This movie has it all. Frank, the master mind.",1
I saw this movie with my dad.,1
check it out if you dare!,1
Recommended 110 %. Had never heard of it previously. The humor is mostly in the dialog. ). This movie needs your full attention. A great combination of cast and writing.,1
One of the best ones is DISORGANIZED CRIME. I like this film for several reasons.,1
All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to see this movie. The cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie. It gets it's meaning across.,1
He gets the drop on O'Neill and escapes.,1
This film is a buried treasure. I like to think of it as much more than that. It didn't look particularly great. Give it a try.,1
More effective than contemporary'drama.,1
"< br / > < br / > This one is strictly a B - Movie ; taken as that, it is rather enjoyable. These two characters would not have had much to do with each other.",1
"She shows her acting skills much more as Otsu in the NHK drama, "" Musashi. "" The really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful (! )",1
This is a movie with a good sense of feeling. This movie was perfect! Who knows?,1
Yet it's executed to perfection.,1
Even his smile is infectious. It's directed in an old - fashioned way and that works fine. < br / > < br / > She has a sexy maturity.,1
"All - in - all, the plot was developed sufficiently. Nothing seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be.",1
"For a better, similar film, try "" Heaven Can Wait. """,1
"Ardolino's next ( Where are they now? ) You really want to know how things are going to work out. This is her film, but she doesn't overstep her bounds as a lead.",1
!,1
It just gets recycled. Another Downey must - see!,1
A charming romantic comedy.,1
He is told he can return to earth but not as himself.,1
"Don't expect Bergman here. Jag är nyfiken Yellow "" is a lot of fun. It is this that, for me, really gives Yellow wings. Yellow is energetic, playful, self - aware, explorative.",1
"It was quite obvious that Burke isn't that young. Pepperhaus "" is a somewhat unusual mix of kids'film and horror, with effective use of sounds and music.",1
It's interesting at very least.,1
"One day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to. When she fells a sleep, which often strangely happens just immediately, she finds herself near the house on a big green field. The doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so. < br / > < br / > Now to the plot. They manage to escape and to kill her father and Anna can finally wake up. Her dreams became a horrendous nightmare. I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. She makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting. And next time she falls asleep the horror begins. Unfortunately I could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night.",1
49,1
This is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama.,1
An unenviable task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly know. I'm glad that this is available on DVD now. This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content & style over empty - headed flashing lights & constant loud noises. If it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of'Paper House'is more in the vein of Sophocles than Tobe Hooper.,1
"And the last is the end of an angry fight, < br / > < br / > that is believable. Especially the supposedly "" pornographic "" sex < br / > < br / > scenes. < br / > < br / > I just rented the new Criterion DVD's of both Yellow and Blue. The first such scene is very realistic.",1
< br / > < br / > Paperhouse is much more than just a horror.,1
"And what a directorial debut by Bernard Rose! I loved, as always, Hans Zimmer's score. I am really impressed.",1
Great story and characters.,1
"Quote "" he looks like madman "". But none where satisfactory. That should confirm I was desperate!",1
While you may find this puppy in your horror section it's anything but. Is a good word to sum up Bernard Rose's brilliantly haunting and poetic Paperhouse. < br / > < br / > Wow! There's much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into.,1
"Which, in view of later events, doesn't seem like a far cry from the truth.",1
This is a way cool fantasy movie. The DVD is available R2 only.,1
"I'm quite proud to be an owner of the soundtrack on CD when it was released in the United States on RCA Victor. Both Charlotte Burke and Elliot Spiers do a magnificent job throughout, I find the editorial comment on Amazon.",1
This touch gives her even more believability out necessity. I cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece.,1
"That'too bad - - it's really very good. However, everybody else is just great.",1
Watch it with lights out! < br / > < br / > Highly recommended. It also hasn't dated that much either.,1
"Often classed as a "" horror movie "" this, I believe, is a grave error. < br / > < br / > Paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film I've ever seen.",1
"Any other film, this song would have had close - ups of both of them. Then Meena Kumari died and it just brought the crowds rolling in. Inhi logoN ne has her 50's younger voice while songs that were re - recorded like Chalo dildar chalo show clear development. Notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the Chalo dildar songs, very unusual. This film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks. etc.",1
"J. Q. All in all, perfection.",1
Pakeeza! Like great poetry it is timeless.,1
"The plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting, before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle. He likes castles, Gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too - which is fine by me! A few years later, murders begin to occur... < br / > < br / > Even though he only made two Giallo's, Miraglia does have his own set of tributes.",1
Pakeezah is surely pinnacle of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled.,1
< br / > < br / > The cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of Josef Werching that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entirety.,1
< br / > < br / > Where does one begin?,1
"In some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face. I've seldom heard such serious, beautiful, poetic, wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack.",1
"It is because in Hong Sang Soo's film, there are no actual shots of wars, troubles and conflicts.",1
"It's a rather hard balance to keep and it's surprising how Hong manages to pull it off twice in a row. This film doesn't pack the same emotional wallop that the first does, < br / > < br / > This is not a fast moving film. Technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear.",1
"This is a great film. Plus, it doesn't keep it's subjects quite as detached as Hou does.",1
"), by that time gone.",1
"It is a look into everyday life, very well and beautifully done. Although the film is slow - moving, it can be very contemplative.",1
Spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone.,1
Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you.,1
"As a baseball fan and light movie addict, it hit a homerun for me. Fever Pitch "" is a winner. He's always funny, even when he does or says very little.",1
!,1
Pity.,1
"I liked this movie,, cute and funny.",1
Check them both out. Not too bad.,1
).,1
This then leads in the Ben ( teacher ) and Lindsey dating. I got it for two quid in Blockbusters so I was happy.,1
How sad is that? I can't recall ever watching one.,1
"While the premise of Fever Pitch is that some things are more important than baseball ( perish the thought ), you would never know it from the way things turn out.",1
). But in this movie - the vibes get you.,1
"Big Fat Greek wedding ; Me, Myself & Irene ). I thought the ending was a little abrupt.",1
I think Fever Pitch will help him out a lot. Busom Buddies? Australian soap operas? ( Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie? What? ) Here's wishing Jimmy a successful career on screen.,1
He is funny enough and gets the most laughs. The love is between the two young lovers.,1
"< br / > < br / > Jimmy Fallen giving his best performance to date stars as Ben, a dorky, lightly nerdy schoolteacher. So Ben scrubs the toilet and the dog's teeth, while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bed. Lindsey is a corporate, career orientated kind of girl, but she has a kind of cuteness that Ben finds totally endearing.",1
"Enter the Boston Red Sox. Yes, commitment. I read the Chronicle's sports section every day.",1
< br / > < br / > It's funny movie and you won't strike out if you rent this one. Also the people he sits with at the baseball games are just as obsessed as he is.,1
"It's no "" My fair lady "" but it is a spirited and honest film. The movie shocked me. I'll simply say i like it. but this movie did not follow that mold.",1
"My whole family hates'em. One more strike, and it's back to SNL! "" It's the joy of being a sports fan. "" You'll walk out of the theater and never go back! "" Well, figuratively speaking.",1
After the party Ben tells her it was'the best night of his life '.,1
"The Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter, are at it again.",1
"Fallon surprisingly rises to his character'gradual emotional maturity. Their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a refreshingly grown - up way, from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him, centered around that they are both facing thirty and single.",1
)... don't ask why!,1
I rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy.,1
That says something in itself.,1
I would definitely recommend it!,1
"Go see it! We expect that from her and she delivered. Kinda spongy? "" Fallon's portrayal "" made "" the movie.",1
Watchable results for this offbeat Western. Check all hardware at the marshal's office ¨.,1
The entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable.,1
"Whilst here, the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of Tollinger's reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer. < br / > < br / > Robert Mitchum is in the lead as Tollinger, perfectly cast, he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace.",1
'Man with the gun'is one of his best.,1
I love them both.,1
A story about solitude and silence. A clear masterpiece. May 1938.,1
I don't want to spoil anymore about the plot : go looking for this film! Gabriele is simply an Anti - Fascist.,1
Don't miss it.,1
Simply amazing - 9 / 10.,1
A true masterpiece of cinema!! ! He acts as real man who does not beg for pity.,1
"But - Why is it not better known? Thank you, IMDb!",1
Usually his films take place on a few stages and are semi - theatrical. Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Pascualino De Santis.,1
"We understand her questions, although we can't be sure what her intentions are. Antonietta feels what we feel. She likes attention anyway. What does this man want from her? Loren plays the scenes very good as well. This is a movie you should see. '",1
She thinks she should be happy.,1
The superb acting between Mastroianni & Loren. My vote is 10 / 10.,1
"< br / > < br / > Every once in a while, you come across a film that really touches a nerve. Time Out calls it'rubbish'and Leonard Maltin, somewhat milder,'pleasant but trifling. Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings. He is well - mannered, cultured and soon she is attracted to him. A SPECIAL DAY ( Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977 ).",1
Even during the end - titles the theater remained completely silent. < br / > < br / > This SPECIAL DAY is truly special.,1
The reason?,1

The cast is brilliant and international here.,1
"I highly recommend this. how??? CotHK does say it starts 5 years after the War of Heros which Parn was a part of. As far as sequels go though, I highly recommend CotHK.",1
"So I had significant hopes for the dub for CHRONICLES, made in 1999 - 2000. ), this TV follow - up is still great fun for fantasy fans. Much of the original cast who lent their English voices to the characters of LODOSS return ( including Lisa Ortiz as Deedlit! ), which is a nice bonus.",1
< br / > < br / > The only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation.,1
No fancy space - ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.,1
The plot isn't too polished.,1
6 billion and growing.... that's obscene. Soylent Green is a classic.,1
Who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong? This film shows what can be done shot on video. The editing provides a quiet revelation of Tobias'life that leaves you watching in fascination. Documenting a documenter. ( Watch for the graphic circumcision scene ).,1

"The time is the future and for many not aware of it, that day is now.",1
Overpopulation means there ` s too many people to feed?,1
At the time it was actually a huge box office success.,1
It's latest product is Soylent Green. For myself it also shows the Right to Life ethic run amuck. Obviously there's no family planning in this world either. We've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive.,1
"But Soylent Green is in a whole other league. Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? I bet this is one of Tarantino's favourites. A priest taking confession and being shot by confessor.",1
"However, the film has a great plot and acting and is super - exciting to watch.",1
Very interesting.,1
"I prefer more vulnerable heroes. Soylent Green IS... a really good movie, actually.",1
I just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years. < br / > < br / > Its reputation should be better. The film also looks so much better in a great 35mm print.,1
The story is solid. < br / > < br / > The music is absolutely perfect. This was the icing on the cake for the film.,1
"But the Italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for, of course.",1
"Still I was never bored. Boyer just walks around looking stricken ( no shock there ). As a serious movie - - a 1. Still, in a way, it is a classic.",1
"The Garden Of Allah "" will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography.",1
It is Paul Claudel reduced to beauty salon magazine standards. Oh well...,1
"Basil Rathbone is fine here, except given very little to do.",1
"I can't say more without spoiling things. At any rate, it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on DVD. Just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the DVD. I can't say for sure, but this might have been the first one ( 3 - strip ). In fact, just how good it looks is amazing.",1
Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie.,1
She look great ; Boyer looks young and trim. I can't help but think he would have been wonderful.,1
Dietrich's costumes are out of this world. ).,1
The remainder of the film was shot on a Hollywood sound stage. Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer are a superb screen couple. North Africa in the 1930's.,1

"All in All, it is very well done.",1

A quiet little Aussie flic that came and went at the cinema.,1
Some genre films need to be dressed up. This one was an exception.,1
You watch movie. This incident scars her. Or Will Maya have a surprise for Jared? Will history repeat itself?,1
Yeah.,1
"I really did wish to see much, much more of Katherine Heigl. And the audiovisual maze was sinister. This one, I adore. It's funny, sexy and scary.",1
It's the consistent undertone in everything in the film.,1
I agree that this is an incredibly brave film.,1
"I can't wait to get the soundtrack. effects, so special side effects. Not fake, just natural.",1
Too bad it was way too blunt for a widespread appeal. And hard to forget. Films like this deserve better!,1
"My particularly No less depraved. Movie are entertainment. The soundtrack was excellent, a blend of everything. Film is art. Just different. She is ruined.",1
"However, I cannot begin to understand the people who've trashed this film. I've seen Irreversible and can understand the comparisons. The way the film drags made it realistic to me. First, this was a BRAVE film. I'm 24 years old.",1
Very innocent flirtation between the two. He is actually the one who introduces Maya to drugs. What should I do? What do You could see the confusion and emotion on Maya's face. < br / > < br / > I give the movie 7. She falls into her own abyss. I had a great time. 5 starts out of a possible 10 stars. ?,1
< br / > < br / > At its very core lies a documentary not quite unlike Otaku no Video. Go figure. Deadpan humor taken to extreme. There is no director I like more than Mamoru Oshii.,1
And quite experimental.,1

The cast was great.,1
"The lead dog is Lazerov ( Dylan McDermott, who makes a terrifyingly real gangster! )",1

"He was great from the beginning. Spielberg also gets fine supporting work from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. In a "" Combat! "" But Falk agreed to Spielberg after watching part of the Clu Gulagher episode of "" The Psychiatrist "".",1
"But he could. Steven Bochco wrote it. Lieutenant Columbo knows that. So no remakes, please.",1
At least that's the feeling this movie left me with. The story however didn't really explored all of its possibilities. The movie is basically in the same style as most of Spierlberg's'70's movies and TV works.,1
His charismatic personality was highly infectious.,1
But this is still a great episode.,1
The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore. However it improved afterwards as the Valentine Party commenced.,1
"Rather than losing more money, he kills her. Jack Cassidy would appear in a later Columbo.",1

I am a big Beatles fan. < br / > < br / > I was not disappointed by this movie.,1
"But it absolutely did, and then some. < br / > < br / > I will watch it again and again. I sat down to watch this film with much trepidation and little hope. At times it seemed that Harris was channeling Lennon.",1
"I didn't even know all their names! I still wonder why I watched this movie. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much!",1
I absolutely loved this film!,1
What an AMAZING movie this was.,1
"What an awesome movie! SCREAM, however, was a good film. "".",1
"THe make - up artists made them look excellent. E. g.'Backbeat '. As for Lennon's rude line in the Italian restaurant, totally unnecessary.",1
Worthy of at least an 8 out of 10.,1
And prepare for a few surprises! It ` s a wicked experience for any Beatles fan.,1
Was VH - 1 treading on hollow ground here?,1
"Most certainly recommended. < br / > < br / > But I was more than a bit pleasantly surprised. Being the Beatlemaniac that I am, I approached Two Of Us with a combination of fear and fascination. Two Of Us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses, and a tale that is both sad and funny. What it does is imagine a meeting between John and Paul in 1976, while John lived in New York.",1
"You also certainly wondered how things went. I mean it's already three years old, for goodness sake!",1
Back to the show. Nuff said.,1

Peter Sollett - you deserve more admiration and respect.,1
"LOVE - HURTS. Everything about it was wonderful! This movie is, in no way, a Scream clone. ), and Marley Shelton. Coming soon... ORG )!",1
What a fun movie! A second viewing might just clear this up.,1
( Good thing Gong Li didn't try to become famous in America! ) This film is quite an achievement. Finally! Latino characters worthy of note. The dialogue is fresh and honest... and thankfully not filled to the brim with cutesy pop culture references.,1

I recommend it ( especialmente si eres Dominican! ),1
This movie feels like a film project.,1
"Yes, thankfully, they do. Yup. Only IMDb knows.",1
He is a natural. So is July Marte.,1
"All he's got is hope and a one - bedroom apartment he shares with his family. So, are hand - held - camera coming - of - age films in vogue, or what?",1
"Incredibly intriguing and captivating, I found it impossible to turn away once I began to watch. < br / > < br / > From a cinematographic I thought there was great use of light and texture.",1
True fans of film will love this authentic movie. The dialog is great.,1
< br / > < br / > 8 out of 10.,1
"Tone was a underrated actor he was rarely given meaty roles, and this may well be his best ( making his paranoiac both fascinating and believably dangerous ).",1
"THE PHANTOM LADY is based on a novel by William Irish ( the great noir writer Cornell Woolrich ). Raines starts going out after the truth, discovering that Gomez has some doubts of his own. She also finds an ally in a friend of Curtis, Franchot Tone, who was apparently out of town the night of the crime. Convicted after a trial, he is awaiting his death sentence.",1
That's about it. It's a colorful slasher movie.,1
"The film has some flaws, yes, but far too many delicious elements to ignore. ( B - movies could tread where A - movies were forbidden to enter! ) At least it does for me. And the plot is intriguing.",1
"This WAS a doozy, I must say. Cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance.",1
Phantom Lady focuses on Scott Henderson ; a man married to a woman he doesn't like.,1
"Krupa probably dubbed Cook in PL. harry carasso, Paris, France 3.",1
"Well, yes. The head police officer, Gomez, turns him over to the DA. < br She accepts, a little gloomily.",1
"But Scott has an alibi, right? His wife's been murdered. Only he doesn't know the woman's name. Neither does the cab driver.",1
Scott's wife has been murdered. Sometimes these are the best kind of dates. Ella Raines is good in the female lead role and Thomas Gomez makes a likable policeman.,1
"These two then form an alliance to prove Scott's alibi. He had however designed children's homes and playgrounds so I suppose "" family man "" had lit up in Carol's brain.",1
A really great film - - flaws aside. She's pretty and full of life. Tone gives dreadful performance.,1
This is definitely a move in the right direction. < br / > < br / > This is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror. I loved her in this movie.,1
It may not even sneak into the top fifty. 'Kansas'is Anderson's secretary by day and amateur detective by night.,1
"The shadows, lighting effects, and camera angles are all effective. Alan Curtis didn't seem upset that he might die and didn't seem happy that he lived. It's this scene that brings "" Phantom Lady "" into new territory. Franchot Tone phoned this one in.",1
The killer is not revealed until the end. She holds her own against much more experienced actors. He is effective as the accused man's best friend.,1
"Sadly not available on DVD as yet, but worth pursuing on TCM or VHS.",1
The rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent. Nevertheless I was engaged by the hook of the Phantom Lady. Recommended 8 / 10. He is no stock villain.,1
* * WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS! < br / > < br / > Gameplay - 8. 5 / 10 ( levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved ). Pure fun!,1
! On whole I like the game A LOT!,1
"It's the original gun barrel from the movies. In Turkey, Bond teams up with lovable sidekick Kerim Bey. < br / > < br / > After the game's opening, the plot faithfully follows the plot of the movie "" FRWL. "" The impersonators voicing villains Rosa Klebb and Red Grant are uncanny. He makes lines like "" Bond James Bond "" and "" Shaken, not stirred "" into a big deal again.",1
< br / > < br / > Bad : Main missions are a bit short. Loads of fun. It ties in with the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy.,1
"Denise Richards is killed third, while she just found a Valentines'Day gift for her at a whirlpool bath. Everybody has loved I'm not a follower of a certain movie genre. In fact, somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted. """,1
I am glad I did.,1
Very good!,1
"I find it to have a rather shrill quality. < br And the movie wouldn't be the same without the song'Adelaide ', not included on Broadway.",1
I won't try to speculate as to what Brando was attempting. And they have changed back to those from their previous scene!,1
! If it weren't for Marlon I would have given this 10 stars.,1
"), who bets big, is in town. Big splashy film of the Broadway music. I give it a 7. The real show stopper is at the crap game at the end.",1
A real joy is the MUSIC.,1
"Those dance and singing routines are fabulous. There she was sister Sharon and here she is Sister Sarah. Same temperament, different story.",1
Those were pretty impressive to me too and were usually the highlights of the film.,1
"So, he has only one choice to host the game, with a thousand dollar tab. It'd be easy to call Guys and Dolls great. If it's not entirely as great as some others of its ilk, it shouldn't be any fault of the filmmaker Joseph L. Mankiewicz.",1
Valentine is almost a comedy / horror. Who is the killer and why is the killer after them?,1
This is what the musical genre was made of. Nothing else needs to be said.,1
"The acting is very uneven. Of course he ends up with the lady ; and Detroit marries hi long - suffering fiancée, Vivian Blaine. "".",1
!,1
It was made forty - eight years ago. Its two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds.,1
"He wasn't great but he was just fine in the role. It wasn't until Brando goes to her office that the story came to life. The scenes between her and Sinatra were obvious. ). I really didn't expect much from Brando as a singer, but he surprised me.",1
Jean Simmons shines as Sarah Brown.,1
I love this movie.,1
"The characters speak in a stylized patois, apparently based on Yiddish idioms.",1
"Even the walking movements themselves are stylised and angular, halfway between a walk and a dance. This, unbelievably, was the first time I'd seen her in a film, yet she dazzled me from the beginning.",1
"Fortunately the music is so great, I don't care that much. As Sky rightly says, it's "" chemistry "". It's not the money it's the pride, but he and she meet their match.",1
"This is, for the most part, DEFINITELY not the case here.",1
Guys and Dolls is a unique play based on the characters. Vivien Blaine had terrific voice and was the perfect Adelaide.,1
Frank Loesser's music sounds great. The look follows closely the fashions of times. < br / > < br / > Vivian Blaine is a delight.,1
says the Prince to Cinderella. This one ought to be a cult fave!,1
Instead it shows more of Cinderella's selfless heart more than any other production and the artwork is simply stunning! I remember watching the Disney version and watching it now makes me think it has somehow lost its magic touch. < br / > < br / > What drew me to this film most of all was it's original take on the old Fairy Tale that none can compare to.,1
"Most films would never even expect such a thing of you. < br / > < br / > The acting ties much of this story together. Side stories happen because they do, and that's how life is. And you can almost never say that. But to have Juan Ruiz Anchía behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty. Much like early John Sayles films, characters are given space to breathe, time to talk.",1
I felt good. I could NOT really feel sorry for these two. They were so realistic.,1
It is VERY depressing until pretty much the very end. It is truly a blessing for the poor kid to have that one someone he can turn to. < br / > < br / > But they just can't.,1
"His family seems to shun him. The Stone Boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s. They really don't even try to talk to him. After while, Arnold even moves in with the old timer.",1
Great!,1
"Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hate. < br / > < br / > What I loved about this film : the lack of dialog. Something we don't get to do alot of with today'films.",1
"The dialogue is sparse but telling, and the nonverbal acting is outstanding.",1
Maybe a sequel could eliminate bad ending.,1
Our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you. < br / > < br / > This is Heather's mom.,1
"Thum up! How far will you go to protect your friends? Lie, kill? Can love beat the odds?",1
"All of the actors in this film, which was inspired by actual events, did a great job. I saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me. 10 / 10 Recommended.",1
"Never mind though, good gripping story.",1
I think this movie should have been in theaters. I enjoyed it very much.,1
I gave it a 8 / 10.,1
I finally watched it this week and what a delight. Adrian and her coach were also quite good.,1
"I recommend it to be seen. < br / > < br / > I think this movie was a little slow at ending, but was well done. You could tell that she was a tough woman. She is more a bad girl and that's what I like about her.",1
"Thanks, Michelle.",1
Highly recommended. But the ending wasn't a disappointment either.,1
I gave it an 8. This movie is a real gem. Check out this movie.,1
And I adore Whoopi to start with - she was amazing.,1
Super.,1
"I can't really explain why, but especially in the love scenes she convinced me. It just looked real I think. But I was wrong.",1
Great work.,1
"She just can't stay away from fighting. < br / > < br / > It would be easy to call this movie a "" Rocky with girls "" i guess. I rate this 7 / 10. But that is not at all what this is about.",1
< br / > < br / > ( originally written 10 / 7 / 2000 ),1
Is the end. It really impressed me.,1
actors are good.,1
Very convincing might I say. I felt the passion the y had for one another. I really enjoyed Girl Fight.,1
"< br / > < br / > Much to my surprise it wasn't about that at all. Needless to say, I didn't watch "" Hart's War "" that night.",1
It is the later outcome to my viewing the entire film from beginning to end. In her high school there is plenty of friction between her female classmates and guys.,1
!,1
"She wants to box. Genius, pure effing'genius. Not looked down upon because she is a woman.",1
"I speak to you as your anthropologist. Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring. No sex. < br / > < br With their narrow hips they can run faster. That will be ten cents, PayPal preferred.",1
"In fact, this may have brought the genre to its apex. Really good. Only Diana herself can decide what to do.",1
Definiately worth a look.,1
"I had heard it was good, but not this good.",1
"She's perfect. She also brings across genuine toughness. Big deal. Women's boxing has been around a long time. So as a boxing movie, it fails.",1
"Diana has found her element. Ultimately, with Tiny's help she finds a way, and the ring soon becomes her second home.",1
!,1
I knew I was going to see this when I saw the first preview. The camera - work is slow and sweet. Very nice.,1
The excitement is palpable. Follow your dreams. I believe this movie will be classic.,1
The on - screen chemistry works. 8 / 10.,1
The cinematography was acceptable. There were a few charged symbols to look for.,1
< br / > < br / > The cast is amazing. < br / > < br / > Warning! Celie's story is a true survival story. She has given birth two children for her father.,1
Definite worth a full price ticket and a couple hours of your time!,1
this a great Disney flick. this is a great family film.,1
It is a beautiful and inspirational film.,1
This was truly a great movie.,1
"A wildcat oil prospector convinces two Catholic nuns back in the 1920s to bankroll a West Texas well. They shared the same feelings and bore the same burdens. These movies neither insulted your intelligence no manipulated your emotions. Unlike "" The Natural, "" "" The Rookie "" shuns swearing, sex, and violence. The heroes differed little from the crowd. Morris attained his dream when he debuted on the mound as a relief pitcher in 1999. < br / > < br / > Moreover, rugged Dennis Quaid plays a real - life individual.",1
"This movie, to me, is about family.",1
Rating : 10 of 10.,1
"This is one of my favorite sports movies. Ladies, if you feel way I do, check this one out.",1
"It is a "" feel good "" story. The participants are believable and capable. Most important, I believe, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball.",1
"The people in Big Lake TX seem so personable that I want to move there. Since then I must've watched it at least three times. < br / > < br / > These are just normal people who have dreams like you and I. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never disappoints. < br / > < br / > If you're looking for a change of pace, then pick this movie up.",1
"It's inspiring, it's emotional, and it's funny. < br > < br / > The Rookie. The baseball scenes are fun, well - filmed, and portrayed excellently. It is a great underdog story and a very friendly family movie. I liked it, I hope you do.",1
It took guts.,1

I love it when they actually do a sports story well. Not this one.,1
It's one heck of thrill ride.,1
Her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sister. She has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth. I dare you to watch this film and not be moved!,1
"Sometimes, Lady Luck smiles on me. That, in itself, is a rare achievement for TV movies. Each day, I waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read.",1
This will leave you breathless.,1
You will be rich rewarded! It could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen. I was wrong.,1
now I KNOW it's a fantasy ).,1

"His father, a The results are spontaneously romantic and surprisingly consistent. Each piece is named after a different Parisian neighborhood and is a reflection on love.",1
"The stories vary from hilarious, to humorous, to touching, to tragic, to banal, to tender. Ask a large group of people their impressions of life in Paris and the result would be something akin to this film.",1
"Possibly my only criticism of the whole film, is that it makes Paris look too good. Absolutely perfect, and very, very funny, without Buscemi having to say a word. But I wish I had.",1
< br / > < br / > There are also a number of memorable quotes.,1
"Paris, je t'aime ( 2006 ) is a film made up of 18 segments. The premise works. < br / > < br / > This is an outstanding movie.",1
"I believe I can truly say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts. < br / > < br / > Tuileries : The Coen Brothers stick to their strange sense of humor and deliver some fine laughs.

"... for Paris is a moveable feast. "" < br / > < br / > Some of the vignettes are poignant and even dark.",1
"A very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust to as a viewer. Greetings again from the darkness. Don't miss Alexander Payne ( director of "" Sideways "" ) as Oscar Wilde.",1
< br / > < br / > Parc Monceau : Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier also.,1
"All easy to follow ( unless the "" experimental "" one irritates your desire for a formulaic story. The stories vary from all out romance to quirky comedy to Alex Payne's touching study of a woman discovering herself to Van Sant and one of those things that happens anywhere.. maybe? Several brought up some emotions for me...",1
"As far as everything else is concerned I can only say - captivating. Makes you want to leave everything behind you, flee to Paris and live those little romances yourself.",1
No problem.,1
All in all I can absolutely recommend this great collage and will be looking forward to its release on DVD. I watched this movie a couple of days ago in a small independent cinema in Paris. The stories were chosen carefully with regard to their matching Arrondissement and express the respective flair perfectly. And not to forget the all over topic of love!,1
"< br / > < br / > LES MARAIS - this was a huge disappointment! Some kind of shampoo salesman arrives in a Chinatown - lookalike place in Paris.

"7 rating on this film. Great full nude scene of her, too.",1
"I found myself at sixes and sevens while watching this one. Was he muzzled in by mammonist producers, perhaps? On the whole, the zooms were, well, inconsistent, and sometimes even trite.",1
"< br / > < br / > Grade : B "" The Gingerbread Man "" is nowhere near as good as that film, but it holds up fairly well on its own. But this southern - fried pot - boiler is pretty good. < br / > < br / > Also starring Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen.",1
"I laughed, cried, and got angry.",1
He is more of a maverick. He is not your typical mainstream purveyor of fantasies. Robert Altman is my favorite American director.,1
"The Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I've ever done! """,1
"And it's surprising that Altman would really want to take on one of these "" I saw that coming from back there! "" as the private detective in Branaugh's employ.",1
Very well done.,1

"Never heard of this movie, saw it on DVD. HA!",1

I bought the DVD immediately after renting it.,1
"Perfect irony. Really touching story of a recruitment camp in America, where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war.",1
"With war genre, laughter isn't something you'd associate with it for most of the time. Other more obscure examples include Kubrick and Welles who covered too much to write about here.",1
"it was a very gritty movie, through and through. Others, not so much.",1
"Are the men really this unabashed and brutal? This film is specifically about the preparation for war, nothing more nothing less.",1

"These songs teach the world to love again and war, hunger, evil are vanquished for eternity.",1
This film doesn't reflect reality. Yes way! Especially in this point Bogus Journey tops its prequel by far. Its friendly - naive and utopian. But who dares to say this film is no art?,1

"Though the acting and scenery etc is poor, who cares. Possibly the funniest movie of all time!!!! ! I recommend anyone to see this classic.",1
< br / > < br / > This gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature.,1
"My Take : A goofy, yet imaginative mess.",1
"It even boils down to 7 games against death - - Battleship and Club. < br / > < br / > This is a surprise. < br / > < br / > - - The "" choices "" motif. What's so good? It's not, it fits the material. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. Probably since this dared to be different is why it took 12 producers to pull it off. They even use Roy Brocksmith from'Total Recall'to emphasize the point.",1
"< br / > < br / > This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye, it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions. Genteel, softly spoken drama from Steven Spielberg was his first real venture into this genre. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong.",1
"The rest of the cast is quite good as well. I don't care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor!",1

And it IS hillarious.,1
"Such an omission beggars belief, since Spielberg's direction here is top - notch.",1
Do not miss it.,1
"< br / > < br / > Jim McKay's writing / direction is graceful and uncluttered. < br / > < br / > Our Song is a film not to be missed - by anyone of any age. What we see here seems, at times, to be heart breakingly real.",1
"The film breathes, stays in the moment, inhabits real time. Some scenes standout, such as the girls lolling about, each revealing her deepest fantasies. < br / > < br / > The naturalism is whole, complete. The story tells itself. Details emerge of their own, are never pushed, and thus seem all the more real and powerful for their understatement. The language is rich, spontaneous, the acting transparent.",1
"It is / was always thus. The opening title slide ` A film by'seems to list everyone in the universe. It's a gesture but by the end of the film, we know it to be a genuine one. This ain't no music video shorthand telling of teenage life. Small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout. Welcome heat and idleness.",1
"Hence, distribution questions - - how do we get our hands on it?",1
I can't wait to see what Mr. McKay does next. There is not one false note in the entire film. Not one.,1
But then again young people today are faced with some variables that I never had to deal with a youth. They except their plight and focus on the same things young girls all over the world are concerned with.,1
"Maria, whose father is in jail, has learned that she is pregnant by Terrell, a local student. Some day, we'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun. While the performances have some amateurish moments, I became so involved with the story that I forgot the girls were even acting. Joycelyn works in an up - scale dress shop but dreams about becoming a singer.",1
This movie would have been better off without both. The creation of the world is another masterpiece.,1
The voices and the sounds are top notch. The end.,1
Its all really well done.,1
It was jaw - dropping.,1
"That was all done in the TV show. Check it out. : ) It was enough to bother me, and I'm 15.",1
"My 3 year old loved it. The Broccoli in the sky? As for violence level? Far beyond the likes of Cars, and even WallE.",1
"Of course, it has its flaws but I can still really recommend it. Hektor alone is worth watching the movie since some of his moments are Stitch - like hilarious.",1
I was amazed.,1
"Of course, Hector is the character most will fall in love with. It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Oh, you have?",1
The humor is top - notch. < br / > < br / > The plot is absolutely romantic. The other char - s are very nice also.,1

< br / > < br / > Lee Shin - ae is a piano teacher. The most interesting thing about Miryang ( Secret Sunshine ) is the actors. But of course he makes him interesting and curiously appealing. Jeon's face is very changeable.,1
"In a Coreen drama such as this "" Secret Sunshine "", you'll also find some comical parts, thriller scenes and romantic times. """,1
Shin - ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can.,1
It is a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering.,1
Secret Sunshine marks the return of director Lee Changdong to the film - making world after a multi - year absence. But this isn't a romantic comedy. What follows is a journey through one woman's tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms.,1
"However, the acting of Jeon Do - Yeon is incredibly beautiful.",1
"But, this is not Hollywood. Do.",1
"Without love, we can't talk about hope and salvation. "" Do you have to go to the prison? "" Her lie causes much sorrow. She says, "" How could You forgive the man before I forgive? """,1
She becomes the centre of the film's universe as well as ours.,1
I saw this film in the worst possible circumstance.,1
"It does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written. Ultimately, it is a matter of faith. I do agree with the reviewer in that, the Evangelical stuff was a bit too much. The movie in a word is superlative.",1

The fact that we're watching a story within a story makes the oddness and exaggerations more palatable.,1
"Man, relax and enjoy.",1

That's a drawback. Nuit Noire contains almost no plot.,1
Even more blatant are John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his insanely jealous torpedo. Both Lancaster and ( surprisingly ) Hodiak fall for Scott.,1

Gerald Soetman is a great writer. Paul Verhoeven is one of greatest directors.,1

"Get a grip! So very European, so very Dutch!",1
Just watch his Dutch films. He needs that.,1
Reve do sex with her at her house as she is a boy. it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much. so it is obviously for me to watch this another Verhoeven movie. < br / > < br / > that's it.,1
A guy being eaten by a Lion * chomp * teeth in the throat. And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.,1
The fun is in figuring it out. On a trip to Flushing he is'seduced'by Christine.,1
This last Dutch speaking film of Verhooven made me laugh good.,1
"Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, the fiery woman tamed by fate.",1
"It's a nice change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare. I saw it in 1983 and it is a film that "" stuck. """,1
1983's The Fourth Man was the last film he made before moving to the U. S. and it seems to have been a transitional film for him. < br / > < br / > From the beginning of The Fourth Man it's clear that the film will be seen from the perspective of the famous albeit impoverished author Gerard.,1
Proves again what an excellent actress she is. So go figure. Could this be coincidence...?,1
"It mixes abstract / surreal / parallel fantasy - reality scenes and somehow makes it all work. If you like the work of Ken Russell and David Lynch, I can almost guarantee you will love this movie. There is NOT an out - of - left - field resolution here. Hell, if you have no idea who they even are, you still might like it.",1
"It can't get much better than this, a true classic erotic nightmare cinema.",1
"Christine travels to Köln to bring her boyfriend and Gerard stays alone in her house. < br / > < br / > The ambiguous "" The Vierde Man "" is another magnificent feature of Paul Verhoeven in his Dutch phase. My vote is eight.",1
Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine ). Jeroen Krabbé holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer.,1
Highly Reommended! Great cinematography by future director Jan de Bont.,1
This is by far Verhoeven's best film ( maybe second only to Robocop ). I even like the spider metaphor. It really was a pleasant surprise.,1
It is first in a line of films people either didn't see or wouldn't see because there are no aliens. It is quite an entrance. This is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations.,1
Why was it X rated? He was right! Then things get strange.,1
! 2 WORDS : Academy Award. Nuff said.,1
All of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed. < br / > < br / > I highly recommend this movie.,1
Each episode was built around a real historical figure of the old west. Both filmed the action with polish. Ace action directer William Witney directed 30 episodes. Franklin Adreon the rest.,1
The Lone Ranger could only wish for lady companionship.,1
"So her transformation at the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise. I have seen the movie at the Viennale a few years ago, where the audiences liked it.",1
"This is a powerful, incredibly provocative film.",1
< br / > < br / > Her only form of mental escape is the Yiddish theatre.,1
"This movie is light, funny, and beautifully filmed.",1

Should we ask more for first movie?,1
Sonja Richter's performance is alone worth price of admission. Highly recommended.,1
"For the record, "" Villa Paranoia "" is a fiction film, written, directed and acted in by Mr. Clausen, and employing certain motifs from Moliere's "" The Imaginary Invalid "". Five prizes in a single weekend - - not a bad scoop for a film from a small country with unknown actors.",1
You believe that he really is sick.,1
This movie is good.,1
"Bitterly. And on top of that, he himself manages to play a b * * * * * * d! Well, for starters, this actually was THE most elegant Clausen film to this date.",1
There's not a lot of plot here.,1
I sure am glad that I have now!,1
"< br / > < br / > Thanks Andrew and Catherine!... and "" Do you have a Flag? """,1
I could listen all day.,1
"Every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see "" Dress to Kill "". Forever more, "" Do you have a flag? """,1
"The topic is exotic and original. ... and I love it. Which is saying a lot for a movie again, made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits.",1
"I was dead at the time! "" Skip over those if you can.",1
One of the best comedians ever.,1
"Right, then, he's absolutely brilliant. He simply shines.",1
What more could anyone want? I laughed so hard I left a puddle. Thanks for your time.,1
He's not a frenetic fantasist like Robin Williams. He's not a joke maker. No way.,1
"Someone by the name of "" Eddie Izzard "" was on. It's convulsively funny.",1
But that makes it only better! And that makes it so great!,1
Highly recommended.,1
Thumbs way up.,1
"'is priceless. Well, he blew us away. He's better than Robin Williams ever was.",1
It is worth it!,1

Saura / Gades'film is unique as the most sensual of all and truly Spanish. Highly recommended.,1
"< br / > < br / > "" Carmen "" is another great movie of Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to the Flamenco dance. My vote is seven.",1
"Now we know, he made this movie. A true classic! The plot is a bit hard to follow.",1
There is passion. The direction wonderful. < br / > < br / > There is tragedy.,1
"It remains a gadget, and, for that reason, a bothersome distraction.",1
This is not a usual film by any standard.,1
< br / > < br / > It was far not for the first time life of one of the most legendary American presidents was brought to the screen. Curiously enough both of them were based on a very successful Broadway Stage Play released in 1938 and written by Robert Sherwood.,1
Cousin Vinnie? But the story was just so weak. I mean come on! How am I supposed to take this seriously.,1
"But as the lawyer in his earlier years he was charismatic, funny in the most unexpected places, and a true gentleman. My what a director's intuition can bring on material that needs just the right nudge in the right directions.",1
"They were expecting something akin to Star Wars, and it was not that. We all have a mountain of swords within us. I'd watch it again. Joseph Campbell, I believe, would have liked this film.",1
< br / > < br / > In the role of Abraham Lincoln we have Henry Fonda who effectively displays a quiet strength. He has also appeared in 11 Best Picture Nominees.,1
"His quiet and straightforward demeanor was rare then and would be today. I believe this is simply a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, widely regarded as the greatest American president. In Mohawk, pioneer America is in full bloom with Americans fending for themselves against Indians and other forces. We even get some scenes between him and a young Mary Todd ; and it is hard to see how they did end up together but that is not point. Indeed, our government surely needs more men like him.",1
"< br / > < br / > It's a nice watch, but not a classic. I just don't believe that real Lincoln was that soft - spoken. Never mind though. I wanted more story and character development. She's a nice lady who we can really feel for. The film is 100 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it.",1
However!,1
It is a fooler.,1
The film sings of the life of a hopeful young man. But for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision. Ford's camera has only praising views to reveal of Mr. Lincoln's early life.,1
I'll say no more. Massey still remains the definitive Lincoln.,1
"Even a filmed make - up test, in which he was stunned by how much he would resemble Lincoln, wouldn't change his mind. ( John Ford offered a different scenario of the events, but the outcome was the same! ) Carl Sandburg's continuation of his epic biography, "" Abraham Lincoln : The War Years "", was published, and quickly became a best seller. Humbled, Fonda took the role.",1
Ford is creating a sort of mythic history of America on screen. Young Mr. Lincoln is pre - Civil War America.,1
Think about that!,1
I found it highly enjoyable look at history. ).,1
It is worth watching.,1

This is a very hilarious short.,1
"Moe and Larry are newly henpecked husbands, having married Shemp's demanding sisters. < br / > < br / > 7 out of 10. The remake contains most of the footage from that film.",1
Almost no USD at all.,1
But besides this? Instant classic of course. This is film history.,1
"He certainly brought the FBI up to par. Marvelous James Stewart, Vera Miles vehicle.",1
The Hardesty character was well drawn and admirable.,1
"This isn't among Jimmy Stewart's best films - - I'm quick to admit that. But, as entertainment goes, it does a good job.",1
"Through it all, the family carries on with bravery and dignity.",1
Nothing appears rushed - unlike Hero. < br / > < br But I can see this film as one you either love or you hate. But that was because this isn't really a remake.,1
The background score is also pleasant. But Jimmy is the movie.,1
"Well maybe that's just me? Vera Miles gives a spotty performance, but it's very convincing, none the less. He even helped bring Communist spies to justice. The film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the FBI handles and how they handle them. Well, just remember before you decide to break the law, the FBI will always be there.",1
It was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film. Burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the Harding administration. Stewart and Miles are most assuredly an all American couple. It's important sometimes to remember there WAS an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover headed it. Some of that time is covered in the film as well.,1
What is significant is what it leaves out. This is no doubt why Purvis was never mentioned in the film. Never mind the Mafia. The FBI accomplishments that the film highlights are undoubtedly all true.,1
"The only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not'just say no ', because as war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought. < br / > < br / > Is it with the great interest and depth of a Ken Burns documentary? It's actually not long enough, in a way.",1
I am waiting for DVD release.,1
This guy knows his stuff! I found him to be an excellent spokesperson for this documentary. The soundtrack was excellent. !,1

Kept me glued through the entire picture. Great cast with just fine acting. < br / > < br / > I appreciated this nicetylish picture. This is really worth checking out.,1

"What does really say? The warmth that should be there is missing. < br / > < br / > May, now a widow, is lost. He dies that night. Paula is a bit ( well, more than a bit ) neurotic.",1
"It doesn't look that we've advanced that such in those aspects. But she's not in the mood for "" resting "", not yet.",1
"< br / > < br / > However, The Mother tells a different story. At the same time, May was coping with life after death of Toots.",1
"She cheated her husband twice with an intellectual. She confesses that she did not love her son and her daughter. Darren is an amoral addicted jerk who does not like anybody, even himself.",1
"She bares more than her soul for the screen. While good with his hands at building a conservatory, he is unable to construct meaning in his life.",1
"What a neat role. Well, i just love him.",1
A must see for serious film lovers.,1
It drew me in relentlessly.,1
Well worth search!!!,1
It won't disappoint.,1
May responds by transforming herself in front of our eyes. He knows how Darren will react to the situation. Obviously her sexual life was next to nothing. Also amazing is Daniel Craig.,1
The twisted part?,1
Great script.,1
"Reid's eyes and face reveal all of May's anguish and despair. His story's not easy to take. Or, when she begs Paula to open the front door after a disastrous date.",1
And it is beautifully acted.,1
"The slippers business was a bit OTT too, on reflection ). Here was a script that let the actors breathe and do something interesting with fairly minor parts. Almost Mike Leigh in that respect ( minus the contrived catharses that the latter inexplicably goes in for ). < br / > < br / > And of course I was, as everyone probably was, dumbfounded by what Anne Reid does with her character and with her body.",1
"Kids - of whatever age - don't want to know about their parents'sex lives. She's attractive, not pretty, and she seems to have a close relationship with mum - at first. Paula ( Cathryn Bradshaw ), is a teacher with aspirations of succeeding as a writer. widow.",1
"It deserves to be. The Daily Planet characters Lois, Jimmy, and Perry were portrayed well.",1
I loved this show. < br / > < br / > A new animated show of Superman was something I was not going to pass up. LOL! Ginny McSwain as Lois Lane. What a rhyme.,1
"< br / > < br / > Care for some more story exaggerations? As Johnny, Mark Damon is a reasonably suitable stand in but without the seething exterior.",1
"She is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty. It more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them a couple, where the wife is especially wicked.",1
"< br / > < br / > Given these criteria, Johnny Yuma succeeds. The quality of the execution is also, obviously, important.",1
All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too. Her performance is very believable. This is a very memorable spaghetti western.,1
Convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started.,1
But you know what? I'm sure a lot of writers are like that.,1
! I thought it kicked a * s!,1
one true great performance. she is like u have never seen before.,1
The characters come to life.,1
"In that sense, it is similar to "" Mr & Mrs Iyer "". There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation. But it is never painted as a black - and - white case. This is a extremely well - made film. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.",1
One of the better movies about the partition that I have seen. I was very fond of this film.,1
will not be able to ask them to return the houses. This movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way. Superb.,1
"All were perfectly cast. Here, no one country is depicted as good or bad.",1
< br / > < br / > I simply loved.,1
"So I don't have a broad basis for comparing Pinjar to other Indian films. I'm relatively new to Bollywood films and was born and raised in the US. Luckily, no comparison is needed.",1
The climax is just killer. Not to be missed. Priyanshu Chattarjee did good work as Triloki. The movie kept haunting me for many days.,1
But this movie changed everything. Two thumbs up!,1
< br / > < br / > A must - see film.,1
I was so totally wrong. This movie gives it all. In a word... amazing.,1
You'll see why.,1
Though in Tepper there is a tendency to downplay his emotions.,1
"Why isn't this film available from imdb? RPM ""? ).",1
"Yes, the cast and crew is basically the same. You should too! In small, cramped spaces.",1
Good work.,1
It certainly kept me awake that night. It's like watching a lab experiment.,1
"Our hero says yes to option 2, and then the actual story commences. B. and would you kill him to obtain freedom? AHA!",1
Personally I think it is well done and worth it. < br / > < br / > Rent this!,1

"During the film, i noticed about 10 people get up and walk out.",1
"And newcomer Lucy Russell succeeds making sympathetic a character that shouldn't be. It is a blatantly artificial conceit, but it somehow works.",1

"It may be the last film by this screen Master. They prefer action. Shakespeare was talky, too. These are what this film is all about. Why?",1
"The supporting cast also was great. could have used a better translation for the title. "" Her French seems to be excellent, as it appears she is fluent in it.",1
This is quite an amazing film to watch. Her view is that of an aristocrat. The filming of Louis's death is masterly. No accounting for taste ).,1
"My dad actually recorded it off the TV. However the new version, featuring Van Der Beek et al, is more comic.",1
"However, there is a couple of caveats to this statement. It begs the question why did Disney make such changes?",1
The children are not the only ones looking for this island. < br / > < br / > Recommended.,1
James Van Der Beek fares best. The voice acting is varied. The other voices are bad.,1
"Initially a box office disappointment in its 1986 release, it has since been embraced by critics and audiences around the world.",1
"There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it. They provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I'm not sure. < br / > < br / > For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it. Here there are a whole bunch of them : the pirates. Still. It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag.",1
It's just sad somehow. I'd give 9. Wondering if this will be the first Ghibi's dud. 2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie. The collapsing scene gave me patches of Metropolis ending.,1
It's not available on any distribution in an English - speaking country. Go figure. < br / > < br / > I just realised I've been using IMDb for years now and I've never reviewed my favourite film. Being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight.,1
"Then go see "" Laputa "".",1
The animation quality is excellent! ( but not quite! ),1
"Suffice to say that I'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I couldn't go any higher for'Spirited Away'and'Princess Mononoke '. And that would be a crime. To say much more would be to ruin the movie, so I'll kindly shut up.",1
"a true fantasy adventure, a must see for all children and adults.",1
But not this one.,1
I know Anime.,1
< br / > < br / > Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japnanese anime. Buy this movie and treasure it.,1
"< br / > < br / > This is exactly what Miyazaki's "" Castle in the Sky "" is all about.",1
"< br / > < br / > The design work on Laputa, nearly twenty years later, is still revolutionary. But I thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find.",1
"Sheeta holds key to Laputa, the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization. It's obviously way past that year now, but the dub has been finally completed. Soon, the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid. Laputa : Castle in the Sky is a film for all ages and I urge everyone to see it. And believe me, it's one fantastic one.",1
You won't regret it. The only sour note is American Dubbing.,1
< br / > < br / > Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney.,1
! Go see it when it comes out in America!,1
"The backgrounds are wonderful. This is one of the best animated family films of all time. < br / > < br / > Why is this film so good? Why? The animation is smooth, detailed, and cinematic ally composed - not a lot of flat shots.",1
This movie totally impressed me!,1
Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.,1
Anyway it seems that a young woman and her.. aunt? Wow.,1
"Needless to say, this movie fits into the aforementioned description to a "" T "".",1
Wow.,1
"I would definitely recommend this film. I have to give the director credit. I am an extremely jaded movie buff. Oh well. Ever. He did it. I must say, I thought I had seen it all.",1
this one is out there.,1
< br / > < br / > Go see it! It´s worth your money time!,1
"Kinda "" adapt "" them, you know? < br / > < br / > But then I thought, well WHY? I found it hilarious.",1
Be satisfied.,1
"Due to an old curse, Mathurin's uncle ( Marcel Dalió ) is strictly against the wedding. Without giving away too much, I can say that fans of exceptional cinema should not consider missing this film. As bizarre as it is, "" La bête "" is doubtlessly also stunningly beautiful in style, settings and cinematography.",1
"I was 15. Oh, there is so much more! I was clearly deceived after seeing... well... everything, to cut a long story short. It may be fun, but I doubt there are other porn films like this one.",1
"The images may look wild, perverse, "" sick "" or exciting, but they are all in relation with the lastly mentioned. Sex, desire and death are very strong and primary things and dominate all the flesh that has a human soul inside it.",1
"The sheep ends up dead and the woman gets scared. The cinematography itself is quite eye - catching and the sets, costumes and locations are elaborate. ! OK... this one's a weirdy.... THE BEAST pops up, rapes the chick and shoots 400 gallons of spunk all over her.",1
It transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art.,1
Some detectives! That's last six minutes in here.,1
"Overall "" La Bête "" is a visual feast. A must - see for fans of European cult cinema.",1
"The theme of bestiality is a definite taboo, and for good reason, I might add ; but the film conveys it ; straight and to the point. The film is very daring with it's subject material, and that is something to give it credit for. < br / > < br / > The film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female. Both man and beast have instincts, only man knows how to control them.",1
Simple enough. Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek's secrets safe. The lead characters in this movie fall into two categories : smart and stupid.,1
"It is funny, dark and extremely enjoyable.",1
Everything is connected and has its why & because. I loved this movie!,1
5 hours with movie.,1
"Physically, several of actors are astonishingly beautiful.",1
"This, and "" Hidden fortress "" are the Kurosawa's that are most dear to me.",1
"< br / > < br / > It's a great film, even if it is not greatest Kurosawa film.",1
The film is a visual work of art.,1
"9 out 10. I was not in the least disappointed, and I'd definitely recommend this.",1
This is one of the weirder movies I have recently watched. Is it any wonder that after making this film Kurasawa tried to kill himself?! It was not a fun experience. No.,1
"However, DKD is also, unlike Dreams, a great film and probably my favorite Kurosawa picture. Why? Mostly, I think, it's the colors.",1
"My vote is nine. """,1
"That its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn't be ignored, but it's not at all a fault of Kurosawa's.",1
"I'm begging you Mr. Hark - can we please have a sequel? Oh man, why can't we have stuff like this coming out of Hollywood? I've watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment. ).",1
The old man who is the center of the town who helps out a burglar that tries to rob him. Maybe too much.,1
"We can't remember just how many weeks nor just how high it got. ( Maybe some one can fill us in on that one item, please! ) Let's look closely now.",1
! I loved it!,1
The Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting.,1
We all enjoy Elton Brown.,1
But... Meh.,1
"And she falls for him. There is some nice battle - of - the - sexes dialogue, and fun exploration of sexual politics.",1
"Pretty special. With this cast, it's delightful. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Definitely worth seeing.",1
I highly recommend it.,1
"But she kittenishly refuses to tell him her name. The other is this film, made in England a year earlier. But he has not reckoned with Merle Oberon as Leslie Steele.",1
"As they all do in this gripping ensemble piece. It transports you into another world. Fans of 30's / 40's movies, Don't miss this one! Florence who? Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie.",1
Later comes a protracted battle with the Cheyenne.,1
Funniest series I have ever seen!!! !,1
< br / > < br / > simply the best movie ever.,1
"It takes trash cinema and elevates it to a work of art. And boy does it ever succeed. If you need chop off your arm to see it, see it. It's worth it.",1
It is the truth.,1
This isn't Masterpiece Theater.,1
Missi Pyle! ) OMG!,1
Funny funny funny funny! Not me.,1
It has officially become my new favourite movie.,1
< br / > < br / > We don't have any giants in Hollywood anymore. None of today's movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years.,1
All the characters are well developed 3D especially Coop.,1
Eileen Bruno doesn't appear to be happy being there. Sean and Jimmy were partners. The real mystery is revealed by her.,1
"< br / > < br / > In the story, Coop is single, a Vietnam war vet, with a deeply troubled past. - Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. I still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale.",1
this was a fantastic episode.,1
I shall be watching this one in repeat! Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in'68.,1
Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters. Beautiful.,1
All in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending.,1
A must - see for any animation fan!,1
De Mille goes West.,1
Directed by Rintaro. Made in 1979.,1
"Those childhood memories... when things were new, and we were filled with curiosity about the world around us ; as we took those initial first steps in the long journey we call life.",1
"Boy, now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing?",1
Coencidence? < br / > < br / > It's worth watching. Does the dog have something to do with it?,1
A lot of care was taken to show original guns of that time.,1
"I've seen this movie more than once. Leaving off the first part,'Hound of Hell'would have sufficed.",1
"The odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything. No, not very. The grainy film quality. ).",1
like this.,1
"Or did it? Just watch Bakovic and Cerar. Because for me, it came back the first time I saw "" Ekspres, Ekspres "". Uh.",1
In one of the compartments he meets with a girl.,1
"Not pompous like the British, not Gung - Ho like the Americans.",1
Gary Cooper is good as usual and i usually don't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here. This movie also deals with Custer's last stand and is far from accurate.,1
But I can promise you - - you'll never forget it.,1
"You won't be disappointed, just awe.",1
This is the Highest Honor accorded to the captured warriors in Japan. Get one copy today and be mesmerized. < br / > < br / > I won't give away the ending here.,1
Unforgettable movie. < br / > < br / > This film succeeds on that level as well.,1
This is a pretty decent example of film noir. That is not very normal.,1
He is a professional pickpocket. The sets show it is a limited budget film. Hoover wanted it changed.,1
66. She didn't get the Oscar. Watch their faces! But I did find the river.,1
"The story line goes something like this. See for instance Shirley Jones in "" Elmer Gantry.",1
"He's a little like Bugs Bunny, as he can be a wise - ass who is a little sneaky. And what a third act. It may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money.",1
It's truly shocking in its reality.,1
It turns out Candy was doing a favor for her ( ex? ) But the real question is what's going on with Skip? Why do we ( the audience ) want to like him so much?,1
They're on her trail when the theft occurs.,1
"For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market. Only in world of film! !",1
"sometimes. She really pulled it off! It is amusing to see Anthony Quinn in an early appearance as a Cheyenne Indian. Gabby Hayes is in there somewhere, but you miss him in the crowd.",1
"9 out of 10. Who Done It? "" A true Stooge classic.",1
< br / > < br / > Peters gets her best role as the moll - with - a - heart - of - gold Candy. And he still has to pretend he never pickpocketed Peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet.,1
See this film.,1
I'm not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywood's great craftsmen. Pickup on South Street is a case in point. Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America's great directors. He had to make do.,1
< br / > < br / > Director Samuel Fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of New York City.,1
Its good film.,1
Really humane. It was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed.,1
"He clearly doesn't trust Tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subway. Two FBI agents had been following Candy and witnessed the theft. One of the agents continues to tail her back to Joey's apartment and the other, Zara ( Willis Bouchey ), visits Police Captain Dan Tiger ( Murvyn Vye ). Skip is flippant and arrogant. The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing. """,1
It worked ; the line stayed in. This film provides the saga of a legendary Wild Bill Hickock.,1
I watched this last night on TV ( HBO ). Ahh yes. It has it all. It was classic.,1
Richard Widmark is great. 10 / 10.,1
< br / > < br / > Jean Peters is radiant as Candy. Throw me in.,1
Wonderful stuff. Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made.,1
< br / > < br / > Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice. She is selfish and demanding. Here is one situation you can't squirm out Ms Mitchell!,1
That's 35 years. The plot is pretty good.,1
In fact Abigail is convinced that he murdered her and made it look like a tragic accident. All the evidence points to Abigil including a pair of missing car keys that was Edmunds.,1
But he had been involved in actual problems with the West. Then he announces he has to go to the theater. < br / > < br / > Basically the film takes up the history of the U. S. after the Civil War.,1
Her acting is idiosyncratic. What humor there is comes from Gordon.,1
The movie has a great written genre story. < br / > < br / > An even better than usual Columbo movie entry.,1
The camera slowly moves out of the room and up towards him. Superb.,1
A top notch Columbo from beginning to end.,1
Don't waste time reading my review.,1
"It's Universal! BOTTOM LINE : As pseudo - history painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies don't distract.",1
To tell more would be unthinkable. I recommend it most highly.,1
"Others by the at times brutal violence. Some may be put off by the slow - burn nature of the opening scenes, or abrupt ending.",1
"She tends to the children, trying to comfort them. Odd. < br / > < br / > The movie opens on Christmas Eve. When she gets to her vehicle, she gets in to start it up. The twin's watch from the stairs. He pins her up against the wall. She notices a car coming up behind her and it blocks her from backing up.",1
"So I decided not to see it. So all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film, e. g. by referencing to quotes. Still, Tim Burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as ` Beetlejuice'or ` Batman '.",1
!,1
"Visually, it's incredible.",1
I hope no one casts him as Tarzan. Lisa Marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy.,1
I thought it was hysterical.,1
Good acting and not over top. They don't make movies like this anymore.,1
! I loved this movie!!,1
It'll blow you away. Both excellent.,1
"It is a minor masterpiece from the 1970s. Lightning paced, there is not one unimportant throwaway scene here. S? These two cops start out as safety - division rookies, busting dealers in plainclothes in their spare time.",1
If the themes of The Girl From Missouri sound familiar it should. < br / > < br / > And it's men of means that Jean Harlow is after. After that he is not amused and he looks to shake Jean from climbing the family tree. I've a feeling we would have seen a much more risqué film. Harlow and Kelly have the same easy chemistry between that Patsy had with Thelma.,1
"What was he really saying? I wonder what that line would have been just couple years earlier before the Hayes code came rolling into town. Fun, cleancut romp as the girls chase men around the country. ), but all is not as it seems...",1
"With her platinum hair & gorgeous accouterments, she is a dazzler.",1
Quite a change from today's standard fare. ),1
Or not. It is hilarious.,1
Very heart warming.,1
etc.,1
"- yes, but an outrageous movie. 9 out of 10.",1
I adored this movie. But also because he is NOT the main actor.,1
"It was a musical, but also romantic, funny, and clever. Only wish I could find it again!",1
"Then, too, the'modern'segment is weakly written. was finally unearthed for a screening.",1
: ),1
"MacMurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army. I don't find ANYTHING hilarious anymore. Something like that. ( Ho hum, right?",1
"Then, too, the'modern'segment is weakly written. was finally unearthed for a screening.",1
It is caratherisic for serbia. Yes it is ironic!,1
"A DVD of this movie, where?? ).",1
!,1
! I surely like it!!,1
Serbia.,1
"But nobody in USA has heard of it, which is a real shame! Serb humor at it's best! Talk about surprised!",1
< br / > < br / > And you're the one behind him. It's great Art!,1
Hi Years ago I was lucky enough to have seen this gem at a > Gypsy film festival in Santa Monica.,1
And happiness.,1
"Also it is sharp, intelligent and lucid. Little masterpiece, hardly reachable. Humor has'inner development ', rare in Serbian movies.",1
This is an Excellent little movie! 1 P. S. It also stars Lisa Rinna! !,1
"< br / > < br / > Alain Chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance. I think the supporting cast do what they can. I have to be 100 % honest with you fellow IMDb users. I didn't buy the dinner sequence. I'm in love with that woman! Plus, the humor is versatile.",1
Boring....??? Everything's great.,1
"Truly rewarding to watch, and again one that only the French seam capable to make. < br / > < br / > So far one of the best 50 or so Films I have seen this year, and well worth five start rating.",1
"I cannot guarantee everyone will like it, but I hope YOU do. < br / > < br / > The setting was interesting, strange but interesting. BUT they all didn't matter.",1
< br / > < br / > Alain Chabat was absolutely terrific. because that film I need at home to watch several more times! And the tears shed were all of laughter. Please? ),1
Of course the best laid plans have a habit of spiralling out of control. French farce with an English. No more talk of marriage from G7.,1
I loved it.,1
At times I find it empowering. And I always find the characters human and real. This film is a definite must see!! !,1
No one out of place or out of character. And the CAST!!!,1
"Forget Mona Lisa Smile, see Home Room.",1
What a mixture of events!,1
Definately must see for everyone.,1
Her body language.,1
SO its a very'real'movie. I never tire of watching it.,1
No matter how good... bad you are.,1
A sparkling film with a great cast and everything working. Grand Canyon is a very strange bird.,1
com / 62229249. myspace.,1
"It affirms Kevin Kline as my favorite actor. But either way, "" Grand Canyon "" is a great movie.",1
"Before there was Crash, there was this interesting film called Grand Canyon.",1
"Well, life itself, for a start. What is a miracle? Hopefully we haven't heard last from Larry Kasdan.",1
They stole show.,1
"Or is it pure luck? She claims the baby cried for her and that her "" rescue "" of the infant was preordained. Is possible something else is going on? "" They threaten violence if he doesn't leave his car. He then announces retirement from producing blood and gore entertainment. Quinten Tarrantino took an acting class whose instructor knew Harvey Keitel.",1
< br / > < br / > All in all? The writers deserved an Oscar. < br / > < br / > This work deals with life in all aspects. < br / > < br / > I really enjoyed the intelligence this exhibited.,1
I still enjoy it again and again.,1
Go ahead and watch it.,1
""". But why the poor reviews for this movie? How did I hear about it? But it delivers with an intensity and force that seems supple. I first saw the film when I was 17 years old.",1
"The couple rushes to his aid. I'm crying now. What tears me up is that this few minutes of film was PERFECT. That's a very trite and shorthand method of describing what Grand Canyon does. The film moves on at the pace of life. That's PERFECT! It's always a short step, too. I cried every time I saw it. Astounding.",1
9 out of 10.,1
Some answers are not.,1
"I'll keep this one quite short. Is it right, no!",1
Exponentially. In my top 5. Not a hand - out. The buzzer never went off during this film. And the chasm. Realistic human performances from all the actors. The ending confused me ). Just a thought. < br / > < br / > I have a pretty level sap - meter.,1
This is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right. It fails Miss Flyte. I know of only a few ). YES the law is drawn VERY badly in Bleak House. < br / > < br / > Has theowinthrop actually seen the series?,1
A few random examples will illustrate the problems. You don't need to read this review. The answer is simple : the book is full of padding. This would not be possible with Bleak House.,1
"( So I gather from Wikipedia. ) Twice, Elliott's character describes it as "" a curse. "" Another is a poor and helpless young boy. < br / > < br / > The acting too is to be applauded.",1
In meantime - I think it is a good presentation.,1
Now read the book!,1
"Esther is raised by her aunt and uncle, who ( in typical Dickens style ) mistreat her. In THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD he apparently was going to go to a murder trial. She is illegitimate, but they won't tell her anything about her parentage. Later we get involved with the gentry, Sir Leicester Dedlock, and his wife. In OUR MUTUAL FRIEND he looks at testators and wills.",1
I didn't like the fact also that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer. 7 / 10 Bethany Cox.,1
It is a must see movie for 2005.,1
Who wouldn't want to go on road trip with Peter Falk? Really delightful.,1
"Great, original jokes.",1
I thought better of him and think less of him for this movie.,1
"And I hadn't even been drinking! Well... we'll see how he does... "" Then I saw Peter Falk was in it. Let's see. I thought : "" Paul Rieser wrote this, huh?",1
"Both men seem to break out of their daily lives. With them away, the daughters can play detectives. It's never too late to change.",1
"A perfect outcome, it is no wonder this movie is that perfect and won that many prices. It is no wonder it took Paul Reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romance / comedy.",1
"The combination of the two is magic. At times, his eyes look so sad.",1
< br / > < br / > Very well written with an adult target audience in mind. Peter Falk's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film.,1
One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving! Grady Harp Well worth viewing. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living.,1
"It's just hilarious when they go fishing. But that's not the end of their journey. Nobody, I can tell you that. And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie.",1
It didn't try to pound a lesson into us. Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu.,1
So spouse and I took a chance.,1
"No violence or nudity but some strong language. Only about 5 for me. """,1
0 to 8.,1
It was an excellent film about adult family relationships. Let's only hope they'll have the chance.,1
"< br / > < br / > Peter Falk is magnificent in the film. The love of Sam for Muriel spans the many years they have known one another ; they seem inseparable. The Thing About my Folks "" came in as a surprise. We had no idea about what to expect. Along the way, father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children.",1
"I saw the film at the Nashville Film Festival. The father presents himself, unannounced, on the doorstep of his son and daughter - in - law. But more important, they each confront the unspoken tensions that can affect any family. It was beautifully done, from cinematography to the acting.",1
"I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film, and so decided to buy her the videotape. My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book. ).",1
"The part of "" Gig Young "" was played by actor Byron Barr who later assumed name before he became famous.",1
The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. I'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week!,1
"He isn't very good. Gig Young is played by, huh?, Gig Young. Weird, eh?",1
"< br / > < br / > If you're Stanwyck fan, this is a no miss.",1
"Honestly, this man is like ice cream : even when he's bad he's good. I first saw Rob Roy twelve years ago. Liam Neeson, as usual, is fantastic, a sexy beast you can't take your eyes off of.",1
"Then, he sends them away and beautifully makes love to his woman. This factor has to do both with the sets and locations of the film as well as the wardrobe.",1
Much like Gladiator. This makes it a more interesting film. Go and see it!,1
"On two fronts, however, "" Rob Roy "" scored far above average. I loved this movie. I could give numerous examples, but why should I?",1
So sorry about this. I absolutely loved this movie.,1
One of my favorites.,1
"In contrast, Rob Roy has grown on me over the years.",1
His rape of Mary is repugnant and harrowing. 10 out of 10. SOME MILD SPOILERS WITHIN.,1
! < br / > < br / > This is a top 50 movie!! Don't listen to them!!,1
"Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves. Sounds fair enough, doesn't it? This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. Rob Roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that Braveheart was.",1
What makes this film is the cast.,1
He is a true actor. They need each other.,1
I can imagine this is how early 18th century people spoke and behaved. I was particularly impressed by the apparently genuine dialog. I would recommend it to all.,1
"Like Braveheart to which it is frequently compared, it is not very historical. He temporarily entrusts this money to his friend, Alan McDonald.",1
"The film is a definite keeper. Many have already asked. Apparently, I am not alone.",1
The story is good and you really want Rob to win. < br / > < br / > All in all just shy of a classic.,1
One of my favorite films. Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role.,1
Its violence is both ugly and glorious. And Tim Roth is a superlative villain.,1
"When he finally does fail, it is not to his fault. To put quite simply, I love "" Braveheart "", but it is a pale shadow to how much I love "" Rob Roy "". Rob Roy may be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. He's a legend, a martyr, a larger than life figurehead. But alas... < br / > < br / > it constantly, and unfairly gets compared to "" Braveheart "". < br / > < br / > Let's face it, William Wallace in "" Braveheart "" is not a real person. < br / > < br / > The depiction of Wallace is very well done and effective. But it really doesn't inspire or intrigue me.",1
"MAJOR SPOILERS!! The first character to get pregnant is the villain's ( Roth ) girlfriend, and when he coldly suggests an abortion, she states it is too late for that. leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene. Rob replies in a noble tone, "" it's not the fault of the child, "" and then states what he thinks name should be, girl or boy. Rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment - - not coincidental symbolism.",1
Both do their jobs well. This is one powerful film. It is excellent.,1
"Honor, in his view, seems a quaint notion... He is intelligent, fair and virile...",1
Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping. Not a single scene is wasted.,1
There's nothing noble in that.,1
"There is motivation, and a method to his madness. You're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse. This movie is an example.",1
Check out Cider House Rules. A thoroughly good ride. Lots of exciting scenes.,1
7-Oct,1
"God, what a horrible legacy slavery gave us. Remind you of Iraq? Huh????? Reminds me of Iraq.",1
I have strong suspicions. Which makes it all more appealing to me. As was Jeffery Wright.,1
"These never officially joined the Confederate army. He gives a fine and understated performance. Now, he turns his attention to another American icon - - the Civil War. When I heard this film was directed by Ang Lee, I made sure to see it. And their costumes are too new.",1
"< br / > < br / > Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict. But the overall feel of the film is genuine. They cannot believe that 19th century farmers would "" talk like poets "". Please rent this film. The stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film.",1
"In short the film is, well, enchanting. Further Deponent Saith Not.",1
A great film....,1
Definitely worth seeing.,1
It even has first CW cavalry battle put on film recently. Who are we to fight?! ).,1
"< br / > < br / > The performances are superb, with Maguire and Wright both courageous and dignified.",1
This movie is one of the sleepers of all time. And she's good! Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel. I gave it a 10 rating.,1
She was amazingly good. Toby Maguire was awesome. A civil war movie is not the typical movie I watch. This movie was wonderfully written. The spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie. The movie was deep.,1
The letter scenes are very moving and yet subtle. Was the war about slavery and an abolitionism?,1
"This movie is cool, observant, and generally light - handed in its judgement, which is GOOD. Don't watch if if you want non - stop action or heart - renting emotion. And I take it very gratefully that she's not a weeping widow.",1
The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long. Check her out in other things you would be surprised.,1
A class A film with fine acting and directing.,1
"), plays a homeless bum who acts as Greek chorus, superbly.",1
Harvey Keital's best performance so far the new century. Recommended.,1

"Watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you. ( An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter. ) As it is, it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film. It is a film about middle age and the choices people make.",1

As incredible as it may seem, Gojoe is an anime - and Hong Kong - inspired samurai action flick with a pacifistic message. < br / > < br / > Other problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence.",1
The music is really good. The lead actors are uniformly excellent. The two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes.,1
Intense.,1
Another solid effort by Tadanobu Asano in my opinion.,1
This is what I call a growth movie.,1
"Actingwise Daisuke Ryu is dignified and powerful with a mysterious savagery as Benkei, while Tadanobu Asano has a driven, cold arrogance as Prince Shanao. Of the leads Masatoshi Nagase rounds things out as an ordinary man, smart and cynical but still unaware of just exactly what the stakes are.",1
Yoshitsune's depiction in Gojo nicely accommodates all of this. This movie rates as one of my all time favourite top 10 movies. It is a time of demons. The scenery This is said to be where ninja clans began historically.,1

Excellent but rather obscure.,1

"She is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an Ogre living in her basement. It is, however, rather good!",1
"Great atmosphere and terror follow. Alright, before we review, I have to ask : why isn't this listed individually? < br / > < br / > The multiple nightmare sequences were pretty freaky. And the monster itself was a scary one, when it was presented correctly. The Ogre "" is an original. I guess the film's TV origins explain the last act.",1
"Of course, that's just a speculation I have, but I think I have my valid evidences. Honestly, the movie is quite atmospheric and even though there are a few unintentionally hilarious situations, I thought it was genuinely creepy on the whole. As a matter of fact, Michele Soavi's "" The Church "" is also known an unofficial "" Demons 3 "" and it's a deceptive title in that case as well, so go figure. I'm sorry but I can relate both films very easily and I'm not saying that as an accusation. Leaving Nevertheless, I think it's fair to say that the story somehow tries to emulate Lucio Fulci's "" The House by the Cemetery "". Having said that, I think it's unfair on the other hand, to say that "" La Casa dell'Orco "" is not worth the look.",1
"And with the "" Demons III "" in the title, one would assume it would. I give "" The Ogre "" 7 out of 10. Just don't expect it to be like the other Demons films. Italian fans should try it out.",1

This one is different. You are going to have to see movie to see what I mean.,1
Clarence falls for her. Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings. Iturbi's piano work is beautiful.,1
The combination doesn't work as well as it could. Brady helps and he and Doolittle end up taking the boy back home. Brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named Lola.,1
Jerry Mouse does more than dance with Gene. The sequence is nicely done.,1
"Depressing how quickly we forget. I get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970. Allow me to explain. < br / > < br / > And as to the lack of a plot, Americans didn't need plot. Everyone wanted Iturbi back then.",1
"Jose Iturbi does great job performing himself. Also Tom Cat is seen there as the butler. It's so energetic. "" Sara Berner is the voice of Jerry Mouse.",1
The fabulous dancing that Kelly does? So what if he wasn't an actor? You'll feel good after seeing this movie. No.,1
"However, observing his physique, it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean. As another viewer noted, this seems almost to be a warm - up for On the Town. Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players.",1
See movie.,1
"He'd become friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly got Sinatra to dance a bit. I sure can't do better than that. Kathryn Grayson didn't do too badly with this either.",1
One of the best dancers of the 20th century. You will NOT be disappointed.,1
I'm not quite sure why this is. How is Brooklyn going to take this betrayal?,1
"Tom then accidentally bites the house maid. Well, this would fit into "" others. "" It felt slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts.",1

"Is there a way out that does not punish Mala? Highly recommended. It is also usual for their women to want to take the place of the missing spouse. Will the Mounties get their man? All of this seems natural in the context of the desolate foreboding Arctic setting. Eventually the lead Eskimo ( Mala ) realizes that he has been duped and he takes his revenge. When an Eskimo man loses his mate, it is natural that other men share their women with their friend. Is there no hope for innocence?",1
"And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in the story. All in all, the film is definitely worth look.",1
"Foremost among them is that of Ray Wise, playing the leading role of Mala the Eskimo.",1
The actresses were great.,1

Wow.,1
"In every other way it's just as formulaic as any standard product. At the time, "" My Left Foot "" was the little movie that could.",1
"May not be for everyone, but not bad at all. Brenda Fricker, as Brown's devoted mother, also won an Oscar for a believable and touching role.",1
"This also changes the people in their lives who have visited them. Had a bad day? A delightfully uplifting movie! Due to financial circumstances, two other women join them.",1
"Human. He has a lot of screen time here. He changes completely, with each character he takes on. No. Fo sho, yo!",1
Probably a man too for that matter.,1
Outstanding!,1

Go and see it!,1
So lucky for Christy!,1
"Brown was born in 1931, one of the thirteen children of a working - class Dublin family. My view, however, is that the majority of these awards were well deserved. Matlin, who played a deaf woman, is herself deaf, but all the others are able - bodied.",1
"Christy doesn't talk back. Walking into pub, he announces, "" My son's a genius. """,1
My left foot is a powerful outstanding film.,1
"There's a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love to her before others and then goes into a frenzied rage after drinking too much. Both Fricker and Day - Lewis won Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. < br / > < br / > The film, however, is a very difficult one to review - - or even watch.",1

I loved so much. It keeps you wanting to see more.,1
I always prefer JC in films such as Project A where his natural comic talents shine through. In serious confines of some elements of Police Story it just doesn't work for me.,1

"This was what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic Queen, which she was! I was a little worried that it wouldn't be historically accurate, but it was and I loved it. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!! She was treated so badly by her mothers adviser Sir John Conroy, because he wanted Britain to have a regency.",1
"< br / > < br / > I liked The Young Victoria very much, and I really took a very nice surprise with it. And I say "" unexpectedly "" because I usually don't pay too much attention to those details.",1
It was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth. If I was Blunt I would have trouble parting with any of them!,1
"The facts of her life are not the Sturm und Drag such as powerful dramas are made of. I have not been this fascinated with a young actress since Cate Blanchett burst upon the scene over ten years ago. What more can be said? Thus, central to the film is the budding love of Victoria and her Prince Albert.",1
"It had a well written screenplay and flawless editing. "", lol. Good performances all around!",1
"As she was in that film, she is once again the standout here. Having others taste your food before you eat it? Not enough can be said about Emily Blunt in this role. Needless to say, it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing. Facing an over - bearing mother? The other actors in the film are also very good.",1
It is a tricky thing to play a queen. I'm just saying.,1
More contemporary stories would include Helen Mirren's award winning portrayal of The Queen on the current reign of Queen Elizabeth II at the turn of Princess Diana's death. < br / > < br / > That's not to say The Young Victoria is without.,1
"), and the rest. First, she must surround herself with the "" right "" advisers to govern wisely. Once he arrives at the palace, he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual. Which brings us to the young queen's second major decision. The young lady refuses, despite John slapping her around. Princess Victoria ( Emily Blunt ) is in line for the throne of England.",1
< br / > < br / > BRAVO : 9 out of 10!,1
An act of love. He is superb.,1
"Everything from the costume designs, sets, hair styles, lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to Victoria's story without ever over - encumbering it. The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history.",1
It's a love story with a twist.,1
Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes.,1
"< br / > < br / > In a word, it was great!",1
"( According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father ). < br / > < br / > There are three main strands to the plot. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81.",1
News of the revolution reach the secluded Siberian village through the grapevine.,1
"It can be seen in three parts. His son, by the local beauty, fights the Germans during Second World War.",1
"I would prefer "" Kurochka Ryaba "" to them...",1
By far!,1
Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly.,1
Wonderfully atmospheric. 5 to.,1
I thank you Hello Playmates.,1
"I Thank You.... < br / > < br / > OLD MOVIES CANE GOOD MOVIES! Years later, I watch it every now and again, enjoying the familiarity. There is much to enjoy. The atmosphere is truly as near sinister as an Arthur Askey vehicle could get.",1
If he was playing an annoying little man as part of the script then he succeeded.,1
His humour is innocent and childish which makes it sweet to watch.,1
"Oh, and can he become the chess champion, also? This is a lovely film, based on a novel by Nabokov. Then, too, the ending is bittersweet.",1
You though are at home. It's set in old rural England during the second world war. < br / > < br / > I will tell you!,1
"< br / > < br / > The set pieces in the movie are very atmospheric. It keeps you hooked from the moment the movie starts till it finishes. They are not dated to me though. It is an escape from reality for a while. This man was in the Will Hay classic "" The Ghost of St Michaels "" as well.",1
It is on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics. The only problem with the film : Fred Astaire singing without dancing.,1
"Overall, I did like film quite a bit - - it had a lot of charm and excellent writing. Because of this, the usual balance and great boy - girl dialog was lacking. I have never been a fan of their show or their movies.",1
The story would have been much better as a half - hour TV episode. Her scene with solid character actor Gardiner as devious snob Keggs is a one - of - a - kind classic.,1
< br / > < br / > Except a leading lady. The surreal fun - house sequence is marvelously staged.,1
"The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. Fontaine does not sing, but does a brief ( and decent ) number with Astaire. Her facial expressions are hilarious. Yikes. < br / > < br / > Fun film, great songs, good cast, and Jan Duggan in a rare spotlight!",1
She's hilarious. I would have thought it was a double except the dancing was so lousy. < br / > < br / > Definitely worth seeing despite flaws.,1
< br / > < br / > There are a few high points.,1
This would not have been too difficult for Dickens. They served ( and still serve ) their purposes. FANCY ROMFORD'S HOUNDS is a title of one of his novels ). His Earl of Emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in England than being... well Earl of Emsworth!,1
< br / > < br / > But...!,1
"Fortunately, she went on to better things. Only the musical interludes give story the lift it needs.",1
"Their two numbers with Fred are high points of film, and worth waiting for. ( George was once a tap dance instructor ). It almost seems spontaneous.",1
"I like humour ( Balkan humour ), photography is an art itself, each scene is artistic to the limit. To understand it you really need to be one of Balkan.",1
Still my N1 remains The Shawshank Redemption!,1
It's a fun film before all.,1
"It is beautiful to see one big movie director to not take himself too seriously. 'Zavet'is something completely different. Of course, if you want to be praised, you have to play safe. Second reference is made to Goran Bregovic previous Kusturica's composer. Average western viewer would not get few references.",1
"Surely, I recommend to everyone to see film. I had two hours of pure energy without rest.",1
"For those who did not watch this movie - watch it. It is simple, but true.",1
"Will they ever express their love for one another? I gave it Big soulful eyes and flawless skin. Will he ever return from the war? I immediately thought : this director loves Ozu. She's almost a Madonna type, she's so beautiful! A real weeper!",1
"Similarly, Emily Watson shows the wealth of her experience ( from her outstanding background on the stage ). < br / > < br / > The Italian sets are stunning.",1
"< br / > < br / > So begins Kabei's struggle to hold down jobs to feed her family, and the frequent, difficult meetings with her husband behind bars. Help comes from relatives, especially on Shigeru's side, since Kabei's own dad had adopted an "" I told you so "" attitude with her choice of spouse.",1
"< br / > < br / > Allow me to explain. It's a funny business, reviewing movies.",1
And there's all that glorious old swing music!,1
maybe - who knew? ) And of course a great celebration of the life of the stage.,1
"Her playing is strictly for artistic fulfillment. The Last of the Blond Bombshells is an entertaining bit of fluff. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a newly widowed woman at loose ends.",1
"And I defy anyone to second - guess ending. I shan't, therefore, give away much more.",1
I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. I would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves. Thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment.,1
This movie will be a favorite of mine.,1
"So speaks Elizabeth ( Judi Dench ), George's widow. One is dead. The rehearsals more often than not turn into off - key shambles. < br / > < br / > Why not? The roses that would appear on his bass drum had a special meaning that attested to his affection. )",1
Life should be this simple. 8 out of 10. A case in point is the flowers that are sent by an admirer to Judi.,1
"2 from Jazz Suite No. What a treat! I've heard that before - where? Beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in late 1920's. It's "" Waltz No. Yes, I went and picked up the soundtrack from Tower's. The front - end subject is the mind - game and mathematical logic of chess.",1
No message.,1
The actors deliver wonderful performances. Among the band members she finds are the ( still foxy! ),1
"She certainly still gets my pulse going! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at 69 years of age. All I can say is, I hope I look as good at their age!",1
"This film has the elusive combination of pace and mood that set some films apart from the opening moments. But wait, there's more. An album of songs so old everyone thinks they're new. "" Well, OK, not really, but this movie is a winner. And why not?",1
"< br / > < br / > After the first time I saw it, I couldn't find it anywhere else. It is the BEST movie I have EVER seen in my life! Soon into the movie, he escapes and starts making his way back to the lake.",1
"Obsession, it seems, has no prejudice or preference ; moreover, it gives no quarter. < br / > < br / > Valentinov is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to Luzhin, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him.",1
Palance's Blackie is as cold as a block of ice.,1
One of America's most brilliant film directors was without question Elia Kazan. This film was a major feat of social realism.,1
"I found very little to criticize here. Kazan did a good job with that. 9 / 10 By the end, they've forged a real bond of respect for each other.",1
The plague is coming! ( um. Kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director. These are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them.,1
It's good.,1
"is simply outstanding. City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease. Zero Mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic. It's tension filled, suspensefully well paced and edited. Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie ( Black Death? )",1
Panic in the Streets ( 1950 )'owes more to British noir that its American counterparts.,1
"As the film opens, two thugs kill another thug. No one seemed willing to believe the doctors! Good actors but also known actors back in 1950. ! The biggest problem is that this illness is so incredibly grotesque that in 1950 they really wouldn't have been allowed to show it.",1
I can almost see where they are coming from. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Kazan's early film noir won an Oscar.,1
"Drama aside, there was lot of eye candy.",1
Black and white suits the film.,1
< br / > < br / > But it's not only the professionals that add color. But my money is on the one - and - only Zero Mostel. I'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes.,1
"Poldi, however, is very ill and unable to provide any information. Blackie brings in his own doctor and As a result, the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable. < br / > < br / > Following a dispute between the participants in a card game, a man called Kochak ( Lewis Charles ) is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area.",1
"It also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director. It's noirish elements, such as paranoia, blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being. To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema.",1
A lot ( all? ),1
< br / He was so intense! We see a family man painting furniture with his young son. < br / > < br / > Mr. Kazan shot on location in New Orleans.,1
I have never found out why.,1
The cast and crew are flawless.,1
I can't really condemn the movie because it does work.,1
"< br / > < br / > The acting is also very good. Panic in the Streets "" is disappointing but still worth watching. The standouts in the cast are the two villains.",1
"If there was any less it would be an Indiana Jones film. Palance got rave reviews in first film where he received notice. As cop Paul Douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest. He plays the same kind of role in the Humphrey Bogart film, The Enforcer.",1
Palance is his usual evil presence. Refreshing ` lost'gem!,1
For fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch.,1
My vote is seven. The engaging plot has not become dated after fifty - seven years.,1
"He wanted to exploit the environment. "" It's so terrific and colorful. The sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked. This film predates those, but Kazan has said that he was already "" untethered "" by the studio. The film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods.",1
"Joe MacDonald, a favourite with the director, photographed Panic In The Streets'detailed environment.",1
Watch it.,1
Some of the conflicts are not resolved. They took some risks and did a few things different.,1
"If you feel lost at the beginning, stick with this. In fact nothing very exciting happens in the entire movie. Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized that I was enjoying this. In the end, it turns out to be a delightfully charming movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > I had my doubts, because even though Freeman is great actor, sometimes he gets involved in bad projects ; this is not one of those times. This is film - making at it's simplest and it's best.",1
Not that much things happen in this movie but A lot of meanings.,1
"It's a difficult movie to classify "" 10 Items or Less "".",1
"Bravo! It is a film that is well directed and written by Brad Silberling. The editing is fair to good, but a little rough.",1
The same goes for Freeman.,1
"Not a conventional character study ; they each represent entire worlds. ( That's quite an aspiration, for somebody who looks like Paz Vega. ) If you don't mind slow pacing and a "" talky "" approach, this film will entertain. A nice watch. It's an odd little film, probably made on a shoestring.",1
This is the start of a new and interesting Star Trek series.,1
"Stuck, Him decides to check out the local market. How is this possible?! "" ). It stays focused, being funny, sad, and well thought out. ) And it's nice to see when a director / script get it right.",1
And it was really good. But that's what director Brad Siberling did.,1
< br / > < br / > Make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits. In real world it's the exact opposite. The film had World Premiered the day before at the Elgin Theatre VISA Screening Room.,1
It also helps considerably that Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are playing the characters.,1
A very rare masterpiece!,1
This movie is really genuine and random.,1
You tell me.,1
So many of his titles were big budget clichés with no heart. But I have to admit that I have often wondered about his choice of roles. I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman.,1
"From canon we know the history of the future. < br / > < br / > There is STAR TREK canon - - lots of it. An unfortunate fact for long time serious fans. With ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking disregard for rank. < br / > < br / > ENTERPRISE pretty much disregards much of ST canon. Still, I liked the actors for the most part.",1
They are completely what started Adult Swim. Leave it to Braik to put on a good show.,1

Hohl brings the plot of Man's Castle to its climax through his scheming. Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith quite seriously.,1
Spencer delivered his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting. ( She started acting as a small child.,1
They sell too many adds. The theme.,1
"Her devotion to him is obvious, and complete.",1
It makes film warm and affectionate. If only more people could see it. It's a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the US.,1

"Oh please - when has anyone told Streisand what to do? She could have been doing good stuff like that all along, bringing audiences UP to her level instead of stooping to what she thought the young public wanted. There had never been a female singer quite like her ever before, and there never would be again ( sorry, Celine - only in your dreams! ).",1
"She had this special filmed her way, and for the most part her vision was by turns clever, canny, and incredible.

I thought King Solomon's Mines was beautifully done. My only reservation was Alison Doody.,1
This vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the AQ / KSM saga. 8 / Unintentional is the word. I hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be. Nor is it a poor attempt to be so.,1

Of course it's not 100 % accurate. But I do agree with the critique that his childhood years went by too fast. Especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened. I don't know what it is with this movies. 7.,1
Yet it is announced as a surrender. It was not. So why is it hilly in the movie? Robert Carlyle does a fine portrayal of his subject.,1

Also society's reaction was also reflected to movie but it was very limited. < br / > < br / > The flow of history is nicely reflected to spectators.

Villagers expose him. It is the concept. This is not a war movie. Che's men attack and are attacked.,1
His army is like a horse that doesn't want to be led.,1
It is probably too long.,1
I watched part one two days ago and today I saw part two. I was struck by how hard it would be to try something as Che tried.,1
I couldn't have said it any better myself.,1
"It surprises me that I actually got the courage to watch the bio flick or flicks "" Che : Parts 1 & 2 "". Why? OK, I am che - chatting a lot of crap towards your way!",1

Che's image has to be one of the most over exploited ever. Of course dying young helps. 5 hours is about right for a movie.,1
Gannon locks Jeff up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town. Jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold.,1
For the most part it was structured finely but somewhat distracting. I feel exactly the opposite. Many reviews I've read reveals that most people tend to like Part One better than Part Two.,1

"The lovely Rosemary La Planche makes an ideal heroine, beautiful, spirited yet vulnerable. Just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging, pervasive fog.",1
But who's complaining? < br / > < br / > Rosemary LaPlanche does her usual imitation of someone in a coma that passes for her acting style.,1
I had never seen this film before. How is that for a twist. And be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection.,1
Its definitely worth a look if you can come across it. < br / > < br / > The plot is simple. She takes over the ferry business as the ghost closes in on the man she loves.,1
Excellent.,1
< br / > < br / > Both movies end with the same image - a close - up of a ringing bell.,1
are highlights of this 1917 feature. Very effective.,1
The only major difference is that this film is set in the North and THE PATRIOT was in the Carolinas. I really wanted to like this film and I don't think I was terribly disappointed. It just doesn't seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each other.,1
This movie is the result. < br / > < br / > Comparisons with BIRTH OF A NATION ( 1915 ) are inevitable.,1
"after clobbering a few detestable hooligans. Strangely enough, the lesbian forgives Mani and becomes her best buddy while she's behind bars.",1
"She's a one - woman vigilante squad, a martial arts queen, a crack shot with no mercy. < br / > < br / > Action & Adventure. She's the ALLEY CAT. Watch for the dramatic ending versus the Gang leader! When her grandparents lose their lives to the brutal thugs.",1
"It is hysterical, hilarious, very entertaining and quite amusing. Artwork is of good quality either.",1
"Wonder if it was - released, or some problem?",1
Was that Pee - Wee Herman's first movie appearance? What about the rooster? I will just say that Cheech's cousin shows up.,1
"Despite this, the film has an excellent sense of pace, and doesn't drag at all.",1
Check it out anyway.,1
The best Cheech & Chong movie so far!,1
Followed by NICE DREAMS. Will Cheech get his freak on? Funny but not as good as first film. But Cheech and Chong fans will enjoy it.,1
And the other 2.,1
"Whipped "" never slowed down for a beat and provided the audience with non - stop comedy. The audience was laughing all the way through. Whipped "" pokes fun at relationships in a way that most sex comedies wouldn't dare.",1
He is a major talent. Check out the trailer on whipped. A MUST SEE!,1
"I look forward to his next effort. If you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes, this might be a film for you. Kudos to Peter Cohen and his network for seeing this through.",1
This movie is hilarious! Everyone can use some of it sometimes.,1
"In plain language, they missed the point. See this movie, you'll laugh from start to finish.",1
Of course this meant I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised as Whipped is actually rather a good movie.,1
"Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a magnificent place, but still not the real place where the film takes place. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps, Corinne Calvet is the nice girl.",1
END OF ENDING SPOILER!!!! There's only a few minor shots of her breasts. This film would get by with a PG - 13 easily now. I actually started to giggle during one!,1
Enjoy.,1
"Disappointed, she returns home and divorces him. A very lonely young man, when I saw it, I willingly concurred.",1
She knows this man is different. This was a very daring film for it's day. One did not need it anyway.,1
"Consequently, the characters are badly developed. My vote is eight.",1
"), who is then trapped in an unconsumated and loveless marriage. Money? First, let's get the "" hoopla "" out of the way. Her boyfriend, Pierre Nay keeps his clothes on at all times.",1
"As I watched this fever dream of an exercise in 1930's sexuality, I thought YOWZA! ).",1
"And, oh yeah, Hedy does get her kit off.",1
The production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and love.,1
"( No need to recap the plot, since others have done so already. ) But in sense that the characters seldom speak when we expect them to. I don't claim either to be any better or worse. < br / > < br / > None of this is intended to belittle today's film - making.",1
"Machatý seems an expert at using motifs. The final bit is odd, to say the least.",1
"After an awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other. Eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake. Some thought it to be scandalous. But the audiences couldn't stay away.",1
"< br / > < br / > The only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is certainly a good comedic actor. Definitely worth a watch, just don't expect to be blown away.",1
"This film is great. """,1
"writhes in his bed in bandages. This is a case of not so much mistaken identity but of there being a lack of peace of mind with oneself and surrounding people. Can he register complaints? ) It won't happen again, Polanski's good - natured but slightly nervous tenant says, but there is no peace even in moving a cabinet or a chair.",1
"; I remember this factor bugging me on first viewing as well, and I'm sorry to say it's no clearer now!",1
But these are trivial concerns. A fine Western costume drama.,1
!,1
It leaves the viewer a lot to think about. This is my kind of film. But it is also a dark comedy.,1
Later Simone dies. He and Stella become pretty close. It gives a lot of that psychological scare.,1
"'The Tenant'is quite an interesting work by Polanski, one of the first of his European exile. The circle is closed.",1
"Damn, he makes for one ugly chick!",1
Then the twists and turns start.,1
"A slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments may make this movie difficult to enjoy, but it's an experience nevertheless. But is he being possessed by a spirit, or is he just letting his wild imagination get the best of him? Once I watched The Tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie. He becomes obsessed with her and slowly starts becoming her : he wears her clothes, puts on makeup, talks like her. And technically speaking, it'a marvel too. In fact this movie can be understood on a literal level as a lonely man slowly becoming crazy without any external influence.",1
The overall weirdness of the film is also a plus.,1
I vividly remember Ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly booed at Cannes. Polanski's Trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order. He seems to have few strong feelings about his likes and dislikes.,1
"You're wrong Mr. Dunston "". This nicotine addiction proves fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen.",1
Roman Polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as Repulsion.,1
"Maybe that is the reason why I took it so seriously. Needless to say, the three films would make a magnificent boxset.",1
"< br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) : "" O Inquilino "" ( The Tenant "" ) My vote is eight. The performances are awesome and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful.",1
"I did not watch it. In the seventies, I really tuned into Roman Polanski.",1
I think it´s one of the best horrormovies ever.,1
< br / > < br / > This is a rare chance to see Polanski himself in a major role. Why?,1
Is there a difference? This is one creepy movie.,1
"And slow. - I still have an overall positive impression of it. < br / > < br / > Yes, movie's obscure.",1
She does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to Dawson.,1
"< br / > < br / > Polanski himself plays Telkovsky, a young man looking for an apartment in France. The supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film.",1
It never let's me down.,1
Kudos to director Robert M. Young. Should she continue to render her own punishment?,1
James Avery is seen as Security Guard. She got a Golden Globe nomination. It asks question is revenge justified. His name is Joe. The man has her purse.,1
There aren't many movies that have riveted me as this one.,1
"Walter Brennan, as Ben, serves as Jeff's long time sidekick. He doesn't have a meaty role, but serves to soften Jeff's hard edges. She eventually has to decide between Gannon and Jeff. They find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction.",1
A real powerhouse. He pays her a visit one fateful day.,1
"She then keeps him in bondage, and the consequences must be faced. Highly recommended. 8 / 10.",1
"She realizes, however, that Joe did get her wallet and knows where she lives.",1
It does make for some disturbing and shocking images! Well done everybody involved.,1
Maybe.,1
"Well, it's just a matter of taste. ), down to 1 standing for Poor.",1
I loved this movie.,1
Bravo Britney. !,1
What is the movie and does it entertain me.,1
"Sadly the great cinematography of the Canadian Rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average DVD transfer, with only the theatrical trailer as an extra.",1
"But, in every movie there is a downer.",1
"< br / > < br / > The rest of the cast does a fine job, too. She reminded me of Diane Lane for all the good reasons.",1
"Ben Hur looked expensive, but not ambitious. The only good German in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of Austreheim. < br / > < br / > Was it a good film? If I was any more gullible to such propaganda I would punish myself for having a part - German ancestry.",1
"The torpedoing, and sinking, of a ship carrying Pickford is "" Titanic "" - like. Of course, German lover Holt arrives.",1
"Against the wall is a very large crucifix. She's also very very pretty. Hatton is OK. < br / > < br / > Pickford is, as always, a pleasure to watch.",1
com based on my other interests.,1
"Fan = YOU MUST. Episodes in funny order, I kept thinking when does Dr Matt leave??? 30am ( i was 14 ). - they made it so confusing.",1
! You will not be disappointed. The good news is that it is OUT ON DVD!!!!,1
Lucas Black as Caleb is also a superb player.,1
"Pithy and to the point is clearly not the IMDb way. ) Reckon it don't get more controversial than that! I'm watching the series again now that it's out on DVD ( yay! ) < br / > < br / > The central performances are gripping, the scripts are layered.",1
Colorful western.,1
"Some Devilish ones too. Someones at the Door "".",1
I was sorry to see it cut off..,1
"I love the series! Some things never change, and we see the "" good old boys "" every day! I somehow think Trinity, SC must have been in Barwell County!",1
?,1
"Well worth a watch, definitely something out of ordinary!",1
Made us go WHAT? Compulsive viewing. Shoot exec.,1
! Sheriff Lucas gave many a viewer the willies.,1
"Ironically, he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without. What is McIntire there for? People are killed. A man So, Flippen is elected instead. He is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money.",1
10 out of 10 for me.,1
"He's Heroin. The devil isn't always in the details. Sure. I really like this show. It's original, and thought provoking.",1
The sheriff is really Satan. Subtle. It was pretty funny. They had me from the first show.,1
"Which, brings me to this part ; the part about that this show is all about. That is until now. For years I hung onto my copies of this show, ones that I had taped or had someone tape for me. The other actors did a super job as well, so I guess you could say, even the casting was hit with me.",1
It's small town supernatural eeriness but with fantastic layered characters. The comparisons made to Stephen King are just about right. Definitely spoilers in this review!,1
"After half an episode, I was hooked.",1
And he is so handsome it hurts!,1
8 / 10 Here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved. core reeling the viewers in. Cunningly interesting Western from a director who had few peers in the genre.,1
"It's not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered. Frankly, the amount goes through the roof. The sarcastic, verbal wit can still be great, though much less of it is than before. Yes, his master is a buffoon, they always are.",1
"Every time, Edmund says Macbeth. I love the episode which Kenneth Connor guest stars as a British thespian. The two thespians do a silly little act to ward off evil spirits. We could still use Black Adder even today. It's funniest things that you will see.",1
"Includes appearances from Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. This is a very good instalment to the popular comedy. Outstanding!",1
< br / > < br / > One of best westerns ever. Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann teamed to do some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the best. Some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of film.,1
Hugh Laurie is a complete hoot.,1
! Exactly how much was Holmes involved in the murders?,1
"Bye Holmies! Yes, John Holmes! Ok!",1
The dialogue is fast and naturalistic and never once rings false.,1
This movie is a victim of such circumstances.,1
Music : just right for this film. Opening credits : great.,1
"Dirk Diggler "" in "" Boogie Nights "" is without a doubt John Holmes, who unlike "" Dirk Diggler "", had no redeeming quality. First, this is a review of the two disc set that came together with the "" Wonderland "" DVD rental.",1
The supporting cast is just as good.,1
"They were being beating with lead pipes, there's not much more that needs to be said. So, finally, it hit the shelves, and I picked it up. < br / > < br / > Overall, an excellent movie worth the watch, even if once! What followed was one of the more engaging flicks I've seen in the last couple years.",1
Great plan. He is the center of this story anyway.,1
"Basically, this film is a murder mystery, and as such - it's excellent. Nonetheless, it's a stunning performance. < br / > < br / > RATING : 7.",1
The cast is good. And why would it be?,1
"That story was told in "" Boogie Nights "".",1
"He is a capable, charming, and brave man, but has his fatal flaws. I am haunted by waters. """,1
This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever seen.,1
To be honest I really don't know what the problem with it is.,1
He is a caricature of a real person. The details of the real life murders make this movie even more eerie. Director James Cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in John's life into a nightmare for all of us watching. Josh Lucas'performance stands out as one of the best in the movie.,1
"To be fair, I expected car chases in this film. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose. I don't know why there are some people who hate movie so.",1
This is rather perfect. This is so exciting!,1
Watch Le Million today!,1
I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive.,1
"ha! "" For these reasons I refrained from giving it the highest rating.",1
There is never a dull moment in this movie! This is one irresistible great cheerful - and technically greatly made movie! Also of course the musical moments were more than great. This is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early French musical. The overall humor is really great in this movie.,1
"I give this film a 9 / 10. It is cheery, funny, and romantic. The romantic moments are also very well developed.",1
This constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me. I was so excited to see this film because I had always heard it was very scary. In typical Japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing. < br / > < br / > The storyline was quite confusing as well.,1
10 / 10 and 5 stars! I love whole plot!,1
I didn't expect getting scared. I don't agree.,1
"Omigosh, this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever, ever seen. < br / > < br / > Super highly recommended.",1
It's not a great movie either. Nice. But not always.,1
"If you want to be scared, watch this film. You get the idea.",1
It is amazing. I can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than Brad Pitt.,1
The make - up is also VERY good. There were so many'surprise'- scenes ( what's the English word? ),1
"but IMHO there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections. < br / > < br / > Secondly, the production was exceptional.",1
"It was not blood and guts, it was eerie, atmospheric and terrifying. In fact, it was easily as good as The Ring which I also thoroughly enjoyed. We are finally getting movies that actually can be categorized as "" Horror ""!! They also set it in Japan in the same location, in the same house. She looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well. This was great.",1
!,1
"The ending scene, too... whoa! I saw the movie by myself. ) I felt foolish but my nerves did not care! ! Oh, yeah, I even half - covered my eyes a few times! Perfect for Halloween. ( Can't wait for Boogeyman! )",1
"The Grudge "" is a remake of Shimizu's own series of popular Japanese horror films. It probably doesn't play as well in your living room. """,1
"< br / > < br / > The Grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend, however. Karen soon learns that something is not right in Emma's home, and she attempts to "" see how deep the rabbit hole goes "".",1
But it is Dumbland.,1
Yes.,1
"It's also very, very, very stupid.",1
"Each episode has its own rhythm. In a way, these eight shorts are unique Lynchian rhythms.",1
no redeeming qualities whatsoever.,1
!,1
"com website, but have now been released on DVD. ). Dumland focuses on the lives of one ( American? )",1
no redeeming qualities whatsoever.,1
"The DVD transfer is from last year, 2001. Overlooked by most people.",1
"A River Runs Through It "" is a wonderful film. < br / > < br / > 8.",1
"But deep down, you can see that Larry cares for him. You will never forget this film, EVER!",1
It is good. They talked for about hour afterwords.,1
Eugene yells at Dominick and throws him against the wall. He has a disability.,1
It's not pleasant material. I think this might be Hulce's best role ever. The story will sit with you awhile.,1
"I know that for a fact, because that's my soul you will be observing.",1
"No such luck. Liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact, but then he does later on.",1
Moral : Don't hire other people to do your dirty work.,1
Kris Kristofferson is creepily effective as Aaron. He hangs out with a bunch of other surly Vietnam vet's. This movie could only originate in the 1970's!! ). Vincent and Kristofferson have good contrasting chemistry with each other.,1
It's great seeing Kris play against type.,1
"Two great undead epics. The effects are very good for such a small film. 100 % fun party movie. I say stop being a prude, enjoy life and get more movies like Zombie Bloodbath and Meat market. Then his guts are shoved out of his mouth. There are a million gore gags and it's almost ALL action. < br / > < br / > OK - UPDATE!!! Some of the plant is still underground and these undead come up and attack area.",1
"The acting goes from terrible to actually pretty good. It is gross. There is not much plot, just lots and lots of gore.",1
I gave this movie an 8. ! !,1
Horror especially.,1
Horror especially.,1
Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It has some bad acting. Sad. Buildings were under water. So does half the movies made. It is raw.,1
And these zombies are fun. Did I have a good time with this movie? No.,1
"The first 20 minutes are cluttered with the most awkward - sounding conversations you could imagine. Luckily, not everyone changes with the times. Well, then again, Zombie Rampage doesn't include that mullet guy, now does it? I mean, what makes this one that much more superior? Conversations that let you know that this isn't just a low - budget zombie flick, this is a Z - grade disasterpiece, fella. Enter Zombie Bloodbath.",1
Top thespic honors go to the pretty and perky Kasey Rausch for her winningly spunky portrayal of the resourceful Daria Trumillio. Frank Dunlay likewise does well as rugged take - charge army veteran Ralph Walsh.,1
The plot does seem far - fetched. !,1
I must've been 13 or 14 when it came on... !,1
"Actually I think its about really cool monsters, which this has.",1
"The only question remains though, where is the DVD? !",1
"The Footage is extraordinary, mesmerizing at times.",1
"The Maxx "" is a must see.",1
"< br / > < br / > You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. Maybe they're all real or dreams. This was the best show to appear on "" Oddities "", hands down. You'll have to wait and find out. The Internet Database lists this as a TV show.",1
I actually like Kerching.,1
"DVD release, anyone?",1
I give it a 10...,1
"And some things are so unbelievable, like the easy availability of clean water.",1
It then becomes a battle for turf.,1
"< br / > < br / > It is an important take, from mid - 1961, on the long Cold War that the U. S. was then embroiled in.",1
Maclean did in his church. How I wish it still was!,1
"And that's about it. Appearance - wise, it should be the reverse. This 30 minutes is no doubt the sexiest of the series. Wow!",1
!,1
"After a few Music Videos also ( Speed Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc. ) the story starts. Wait and see.. Amazing! During the chase we see fantastic segments, fx.",1
Michael Is King.,1
! This movie is my all time favorite!!!,1
I give the first segment a 9 / 10. I liked the dancing but that was like out I even loved the message in the song. This segment is the Music video but it's redone by Kids.,1
And I liked it that way.,1
At long last!,1
"I am haunted by waters. "" I'm sorry that more people didn't appreciate it. It was beautiful!",1
"It was so interesting and moving. It was great, drama, mystery, and more. I loved it!",1
He's so talented! !,1
bye bye.,1
Cue another song ( big shock there ). and the creepy chase begins again.,1
But you will find more.,1
Yeah. I found it a little out - of - whack compared to the rest of the film.,1
It sure is in my book. You will be entertained the whole way through. When I first saw this movie I was with my dad.,1
"Mr Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. Everything I've mentioned is here. His short movies, i. e. music videos, are simply the best. < br / > < br / > My first impression of this film was "" What is this...? """,1
"MJ and the little girl he is with get caught, then chased... yada yada yada. This movie is great. It's passable.",1
"It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! If not, then stay away. Because MJ overheard his plans?",1
"His music, his dancing.. I almost cried.",1
"The first time I saw this "" film "" I loved it. I give it a 10 +!",1
Lots of dancing. It is a sad day for all of us.,1
I hope it comes out on DVD!,1
The club is now filled with zoot suiters and swing dancers.,1
The Stooges performed very well in this short! I recommend one!,1
In this short the trio are handymen working in a recording studio. The stooge are pelted out of room. They end up using the lucia sexlet until the baritone recognizes them and unplugs it. Excellent. Moe calls Curly Senior Cucaracha. The voice is amazing.,1
"Most Stoogephiles consider this to be the best Stooges short bar none, and they're right. A must - see.",1
< br / > < br / > 10 / 10 Be he still managed to pull it off in his last ones!,1
Micro - phonies is a classic Stooge short. No doubt this is essential viewing for Stooge fans.,1
sometimes it takes a lifetime.,1
"Whew, we eluded them, "" says Moe. "" Finally things calm down. "" In all, a pretty good episode.",1
"Even in a minor entry like SAPS AT SEA, one can see that Laurel and Hardy were great comedians. For SAPS AT SEA has its slow spots. The title aptly describes the starring team, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.",1
Lighten up already.,1
"That's the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of Hal Roach. The connection here is the year 1940. I'll mention the significance of the latter later on. All right After they find one they like, we find out that convict Nick Grainger ( Richard Cramer ) has just escaped... The latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment.",1
I mean Fox.,1
"Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. The early story at the boys'apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with Stan doing a banana within a banana bit. On that count, "" Saps At Sea "" provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well on it's way to hornomania.",1
"It's just not as special as the other two. It has just enough time to it to hit the right notes. This is not going to be a peaceful vacation. < br / > < br / > Stan and Ollie work in a factory that manufactures horns. Ollie's nerves finally snap, and he goes on a rampage.",1
"Eat it. "" is one of my favorite moments in the oeuvre.",1
Fortunately there is more. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. In a little town in Montana two brothers grow up.,1
"The doctor ( James Finlayson - - in his last film with the team ) recommends an ocean voyage. They had a bit of an edge that all the later films lack. This sounds pretty funny, but it isn't.",1
"It's reasonably funny by bits, it got great stars and it's gorgeous to look at. But it's a fairy tale, and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow.",1
But where script and film really come to life is in the battle of the sexes that follows.,1
The shows are all basically identical. They actually saved men.,1
Heck the character Goose actually scared me sometimes. He was just that odd at the time. !,1
I am hoping that more come out. Because it bloody well rocked.,1
"They were OK matches, but DiBiase deserved better in his final pay per view match. They just needed a Borga push on pay per view television. Is there a soul out there who didn't like Akeem? How often do you see two legends win Feud of the Year this late in their careers? Who knew the Bodies could hold their own against one of the best teams ever? But I loved it. I wish Perfect could have won, but Michaels lies down for no one.",1
A new crop of talent needed to be pushed. As such there was much anticipation for this match.,1
"Could it be Doc Ock? However, that is also a weak point. Spider - man has been framed by a mysterious impostor.",1
So be warned if you have XP. Rated E ( Contains Violence ).,1
Buy today! Almost every costume has special abilities! But still great! It gives you another health bar! He was really planing a symbiote invasion!,1
"But Carnage is actually kind of fun to fight. Next boss is Carnage, who is, you guessed it, easy to beat. The 4th boss is Venom again. The second boss, Rhino, is also very easy. The 5th boss is Mysterio, who I think is the funnest boss to battle in the game. I gave it an 8 out of 10.",1
He does more than spin webs.,1
"< br / > < br / > The three main characters are amazing. Possibly, this was his best performance ever.",1
This movie is essentially Deer Hunter 2.,1
Excellent film. Not sure why its not higher rated.,1
"All he wants, he says, is for people to leave him alone. Jacknife is a war movie that is just about as far removed from the war as war movies get. Dave reminds Martha several times that Megs is not his friend, just someone he knows.",1
After the war none is a hero. Simp magnificent movie.,1
They can't. I loved this movie.,1
it's not an epic like The Deer Hunter. it's acting in this one that makes it so great.,1
Granted it was entertaining but shallow. A place where you seldom worry about crime. The scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension. There is a lot of deep thinking in this film.,1
"And the long - suffering Martha finds her needs tended by Jacknife, too. Highly recommended.",1
Very worthwhile.,1
"While we are on this subject, "" Casino "" 7. ! 8 out of 10?",1
"< br / > < br / > 8 / 10 This guy is an awful actor. He stinks. It's a genius performance. Be it comedy, drama, tear - jerkers etc.",1
! thats what i thought jackass. don't rate movies u don't understand.,1
Its nice but not all that excellent.,1
The three newcomer actresses are average. Garam Masala is his funniest film he has made.,1
"The Story told is not just a family history, but a history of Life.",1
This movie was a fantastic comedy.,1
"In Mexico this movie was aired only in PayTV. A true ideas'war : two different Germans, both with faith in there believes.",1
A touch of drama adds 2000 realism.,1
"They are vibrant, beautiful, sexy!",1
The script itself was very well put together. ( During the run of this movie. ) Rose tries her luck at being a comedian. From a non - fan I still enjoyed this little get - together.,1
Tom Skerritt is the Rev. < br / > < br / > Redford's cast is perfect.,1
"The Italian'is among the great or near - great films of 1915 that are available today. < br / > < br / > Unfortunately, the cinematographer appears to be unknown.",1
"Very neat. The Italian "" is such a film.",1
'Maintaining proper perspective is key!,1
This picture is well worth time.,1
She stole show!,1
But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia. But here's a hint. < br / > < br / > This film was sadly shown at three o'clock in the morning on TCM.,1
Master flyfisherman. Dad does the work of the Lord. Mom takes care of house and home. The parents fit snugly into their roles.,1
Everything is predictable. < br / > < br / > Skip : Because you've had enough of all this couple - fest nonsense!,1
Yet this is the case in this Hindi film.,1
Some of dialogs are quite good. Songs are OK too. Very nicely done.,1
I was waiting to see this movie from a long time.,1
This is a really well made movie. No aesthetic sunsets in this one. < br / > < br / >'Doghi'is not a Hindi movie. The rest of the cast and crew too are not mentioned at all. Sumitra Bhave has always made sensible cinema and this is my favourite film by her.,1
Sumitra Bhave's concern and humanism shines through.,1
Goes way above even any international movie of any repute.,1
I recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics. If I'm correct Ralph Bashki did that movie too.,1
The acting is great. But oatmeal stayed on the plate! That scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors! That is funny! The sunburn! and they all leave. I disagree.,1
Done well and well done. < br / > < br / > Racist? I don't know.,1
"Racist, but good. Well, this is Coonskin.",1
"Coonskin "" wants to be more. It's by Ralph Bakshi.",1
Coonskin might be my favorite Ralph Bakshi film.,1
The film moves on as the Italian mafia want him out. Worth watching for Bashki or Blaxploitation film fans. They decide to make names for themselves in Harlem.,1
"That said, I definitely recommend Coonskin to fans of Bakshi and of every form of animation. That is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children.",1
"hmmm... pretend they never exist? I had watched this film from Ralph Bakshi ( Wizards, Hey Good Lookin'), one night ago on www. afrovideo.",1
"7 / 10. It's very sloppy and doesn't really say anything. Besides, isn't Bakshi white?",1
Wonderful stuff.,1
"Fly fishing!! His wife was God fearing, and dutiful. ! Brad Pitt starred in this film before he was really THE!!",1
"He was an excellent comedic actor, and a truly nice, sincere person.",1
A lot.,1
Woah!,1
I can only give this a 7. Excellent makeup and special effects too. Will she escape? But I find this film annoying. Where are they from? )?,1
"I either really love them or I loathe them. Stephen King movies are a funny thing with me. Some of the smaller ones, I really loved.",1
"< br / > < br / > Anyway, I liked it. It really is so bad good. This is not a good movie but I still like it.",1
I even had the home version!,1
"Such as Amy Dolenz, I was smitten with Mädchen Amick.",1
"Of Course, Superman AND Batman. Hope more like this are made. And line delivery seems to be a problem with him. He stands around with a goofy look on his face that simply says, "" slap me. "" I believe the goal was to get it as close to the comic character than the movie persona.",1
"The attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. No more "" Batman & Robin "" fiasco, or Hulk, Daredevil etc. Even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts. !",1
It's... not good. Iconic. The acting is perhaps the most evident. The editing is spot - on.,1
i won't go int to the storyline here.,1
"< br / > < br / > As far as this film goes, I could easily pick it apart. Sure the CGI effects aren't perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. Great job.",1
"Supes is toned no doubt but not bulk. Superman flies through the sky. Certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of Hollywood lately. The suit Kent wore masked his size. I'd probably pay to see a film, if ever made, and would be sure to catch it on television. Now this may not be just O'Hearn's fault, Collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction. < br / > < br / > All in all it was a good trailer. Evidently the harness and rigging supporting O'Hearn must have been located on his lower torso.",1
it was cool.,1
"I don't know guys... Oh, Lois is pretty hot too. ). If given a bigger budget, and his own movie... He may be handsome, but a GQ Stud he is not.",1
Let me make one thing clear. 2'But does he really suit role? Why? 1'Great!,1
"World's Finest "" is an unique project. It has some impressive shots but also a couple of lame ones, mainly Superman flying sequences. < br / > < br / > So the movie is one big tease, even more than standards everyday real movie trailers. But really the better and more spectacular moments really compensate for this. I even found it a pretty laughable thing to watch.",1
< br / > < br / > This film is still great fun.,1
Santa Anna was within his prerogatives to be angry.,1
"As might be expected, Bing is in fine voice.",1
It's great family entertainment too. Hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons so I simply accept it as is.,1
"This was a woman that technicolor was invented for. < br / > < br / > This is Crosby at the top of his game. That song was nominated for best song, but lost to Baby It's Cold Outside.",1
"The Pensacolians are coming. Rarely is it seen as a growing film town. Even martial arts stereotypes. Watch and listen, world. More film companies are coming in to shoot. Like virus.",1
"The female victim looks vulnerable. Yes, this is an ultra - low budget movie.",1
The title says it all.,1
! You are happy for the ending.,1
Micheal des Barres is a hoot as an over the top attorney. Bill Nunn plays a Cadillac - loving mystery man who becomes her lover.,1
"As long as that stands, we will have a set for future Alamo interpretations for the screen. That man needed such a weapon. Back in the day no one saw ironic contradiction in that.",1
I couldn't have done better myself!,1
"Haha! If only I had seen this film as a kid! subgenre. Is Sammi's music possessed? """,1
In reality he probably would die of a broken neck. Go and buy this one.,1
"It certainly was THE movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time. Recently, he has been considering a TV comeback. Or should I say MP3 player? Sadly, Tony passed away on February 27th 1995 of AIDS related cancer.",1
I love it so much. I gave this a 10 out of 10 points.,1
"Granted Freddy never molested a girl in a car before. Nothing great, but a nice time filler.",1
"It's only Rock'N'Roll!?! """,1
I paid $ 25.,1
Bowie wryly explains.,1
It is all about the extreme demonic power of metal. 9 / 10!,1
"The teen characters are horribly clichéd. The acting is pretty good. That was my experience with "" Trick or Treat. "" who speaks out against heavy metal. No other reason.",1
"It's got a surprising number of good qualities. But what really sucks is the music. Ironic, huh? com ResidentHazard.",1
Porn seems to sell. I may have nightmares of him next night.,1
Nothing is acceptable that does not fit Santa Anna's wishes or activities. Padilla did not have any spoken dialog ( even in Spanish ). < br / > < br / > Here we see the egotistical monster at his worst. They did bring in the issue of slavery. Raul Julia was a wonderful stage actor.,1
The soundtrack's banging '. CHECK THIS MOFO OUT.,1
"Eddie tries to destroy album, which results in Sammi coming back to life via Eddie's stereo speakers.",1
One of my favourite films. And what does Roger do? ).,1
I first saw this film as a teenager.,1
"Being a big fan of KISS, it was great to see Gene in the movie. The'OZZY - Gene'cover was only created for the $ 5 re - release. I really wanted the movie, but not at that ridiculous price. Definitely not to be taken too seriously, but just enjoyed!",1
God I love this movie.,1
We even get a few garbled words from Leo Gorcey.,1
How times change!,1
"In fact, while this isn't a great film aesthetically, it's sure a lot of fun to watch, so I will give it a 7!",1
: ) I am 19 years old now. I was all mixed up.,1
He's something to watch!,1
"Great job! The score, though not bad, gave film almost a music video feel. I walk away from this very satisfied. Along with a nice twist at the end its a cool package overall.",1
Worth watching more than once! The Cure uses voice over to create an intense mood.,1
"What really impress me are the camera work and music. So the energy pushes audience back from the emotion of the film. Way to go, Ryan!",1
Give kid a break for Gods sake! Marvelous job then in that respect!,1
"< br / > < br / > So, give it a watch, but do it with the sound turned off. < br / > < br / > Where the film is unfortunately let down however is the sound.",1
And with any film that is all that matters. There is no major tech. stuff to point out.,1
"However, the thing I didn't love was some of the writing. While the basic idea was great, the ending was just too easy to foresee. Good job.",1
The writing was top - notch.,1
This one is an excellent addition to genre.,1
My vote is nine. But time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end. I hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen.,1
"Many people have also compared it to one of all time greats, CASABLANCA.",1
GO SEE THIS MOVIE! ! One of the most erotic lesbian scenes I have ever seen.,1
Many of the Betty Boop cartoons showed her undress without revealing any defining features either.,1
< br / > < br / > Now if only I can figure out why I watched cartoon about menstruation.,1
He knew what he was doing. allure of the film still remains. The real sounds in contrast are from non - conformists.,1
"He was killed by a 150 lb. While serving his prison sentence, Mark died an ignoble death. Mark Frechette stars as Mark, a college radical leftist.",1
What does that REALLY mean?,1
They were beautiful but inexperienced. Why?,1
"Oh, and I haven't even mentioned highly explosive ending.",1
"< br / > < br / > Let's be honest. Seriously, these straight and sober reviews of ZP miss the point.",1
Events. So what do we see?,1
"( Still do, it has aged very well. )",1
ZP is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement. In my point of view a film to remember.,1
It's time for a full evaluation of the film. < br / > < br / > The print I saw runs 1 hour 50 minutes. Antonioni was very daring to do this.,1
Even the anti - establishment students are as inauthentic as gov't they rebel against.,1
"It is a colourful intermission in a colourless landscape. Mark from the "" rebel "" youths, Daria from an estate agency corporation. Not so.",1
"The dance between the airplane flying over and the girl's car makes for a series of great shots. It just leaves you in awe. < br / > < br / > The first part seems a lot more fragmentary, which is not a bad thing, it just requires more of an effort to follow. Perhaps it's true that, like In the end, I realised perhaps it was better that way, because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one. When it gets to the desert scenes, all efforts are repaid in full.",1
Its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey'60s. She - took - her - time... To Live. It's politics too upfront and ridiculous.,1
"is a part of a "" reality group "". But. When this film was made, the hippie thing had gone mainstream.",1
"And the desert badlands are beautiful. < br / > < br / > Even so, I like this film.",1
"Obvious hippie - era, dated and easy symbolism and all. He is virtually unsurpassed in this skill. For my taste, Zabriskie didn't have a tedious minute in it. Well, I loved it. I really can't see why.",1
"Also, Antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful ever to grace the screen. Well worth seeking out, and one of those key films of the 60s that demands a DVD restoration / release.",1
""", but this was one of them. A director's job is to see "", Antonioni once stated. Perhaps that was point.",1
"For me, this movie fit like a glove.",1
"Well, that's not exactly true.",1
"< br / > < br / > Antonioni's compositions are created for the Cinemascope landscape. < br / > < br / > At last the audience could understand "" Zabriskie Point. """,1
< br / > < br / > An unexpected gem.,1
"A rare gem, among many jewels. However, I will maintain some sense of dignity. I would just like to state that this may be biased, as I am a producer on the film. < br / > < br / > All in all, this was treat.",1
"The movie does a great job of giving us people we canympathize with. There is a lot of heart in this movie, a lot of wit to. I have to say that it was a lot of fun.",1
Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant. I am decidedly not in the target audience for this film.,1

I think they are just jealous. Hopefully there will be a follow up so keep me posted Jon. Fantastic after party too.,1
This is a scandal. The music of Albeniz pervades this film.,1

"He moved to France in his early thirties and was influenced by French composers. If Saura hadn't done anything like this before, Iberia would be a milestone.",1
In fact this would make a perfect DVD to demo your system. Wow! You can tell that they are a close family. I wish we could all have that experience. It is about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. The script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son.,1
It is quite possibly the best worst movie ever. You won't regret it! It is a true gem.,1

"If you haven't read Othello, see this. Very nice work.",1
"That was, of course, way before I saw this. Laurence Fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career.",1
"Some might say this film is overly Iago - centric, but I disagree. The acting, as stated previously, is very good. I give it a marginal recommendation.",1
"SUrprisingly, he didn't direct it but played a role. not that there was a British vs. American issue about it. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. IT's just worth watching. Apart from other Shakespeare tragedies, this is dealt with issue of race.",1
"Nice to see the views of Venice, too.",1
"3 Certainly in Shakespeare's day they used black face just as they used boys to make girls. 2 Why is this important? Students often ask me why I choose this version of Othello. Perhaps then, the reason is same. Why should a Black actor be the Black man on the stage? Fishburne's depiction is therefore classically tragic.",1
It is not an easy thing to do.,1
"( Even Shakesspeare, after all, can be improved upon, now and again - - and if that be treason, make most of it!",1
The language somehow breaks the time barrier. To my surprise Othello was great!,1
"Whatever the reason, I thought it was pitch perfect.",1
"Due to his insane jealousy, he's out for revenge. It's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you've read it. Othello, the classic Shakespearen story of love, betrayal, lies, and tragedy.",1
"The director had a great cast, and no one offered bad performance. displays his usual talent for Shakespeare in this movie, he is somewhat marginalized. Also, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. On the other hand, maybe the did just meet - - - like Romeo and Juliet. Although Kenneth Brannagh ( sp? )",1
Do watch it.,1
"Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino. Why?",1
Kick back and enjoy.,1
But this is better than that. I like this movie. The critics are dumb.,1
"A real winner, in my mind. Much like the hit comedy, Elf, in fact. Take my advice and rent it. = D It had a few serious moments, sandwiched between hilarity.",1
"Don't avoid this movie because of the reviews. If you don't like it... well, now you know. Yes, but they still make it work!",1
Good team.,1
Especially a romantic fantasy.,1
"< br / > < br / > This film was a dark comedy gem, and I'm not sure what people expect. It's wittier, wackier, and an offbeat, enjoyable gem. < br / > < br / > Remember this people ; Most times, Popular doesn't equal Good.",1
< br / > < br / > Why do I love Envy?,1
"Everything else is plain odd. Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors. Absolutely hate it. < br / > < br / > The plot is really simple. If you don't, run away from this movie.",1

"So I don't ruin it for you, I'll be very brief.",1
The film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time. I was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival as well.,1
"She's also getting over a divorce. Remember kids, safe sex ). All Kira Reed fans MUST see this.",1
I enjoyed this film very much. Cinematography was average.,1
Sex is not always required in a good romantic movie.,1
"And i was right. Like every tale, it has some short of morality. She literally shines in this movie.",1
"Overall, a fun, cute movie.",1
And - what a delightful surprise!,1
I'd watch it again... with a girl.,1
The biggest applause should go to the two leads. Not bad.,1
This film is like marmite. You either love it or you hate it.,1

"Jack Frost is one that not only delivers but is actually one of the best that I've seen in a long time. The lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny. I truly hope there is a sequel and I'll be right there to watch it on whatever cable channel does it. I gave it a 7 out of 10, this is a great movie for dates and couples in late hours.",1

"All in all, the story is enchanting family entertainment. Miss Price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life. This actor was previously cast as the children's father in the movie Mary Poppins. Some have been critical, but the movie features excellent special effects. Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to London on their flying bed.",1
"Other big names make outstanding roles. please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie!",1

Great family entertainment and we need more films like this today.,1

There are two parts that stay with me.,1
I'm sorry it didn't materialize into a series. Sam ( Flash Gordon ) Jones was a perfect Spirit.,1
"We say, < br / > < br / > The film is a sincere attempt to put Eisner's world on screen. The casting of Denny Colt / The Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was really quite well done. This can't make up its mind if it's serious or not! "" The left over screen play became the serial, THE MASKED MARVEL, one of Republic's best.",1
He also plays a cameo as the conductor.,1
"Lots of bad chasing the good. Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - tough on the inside, and shall we say in touch with his feminine side. Another encounter involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs. My guess it will find big success on video.",1
There is only one good song.,1
"Is the murderer found out before the curtain falls? A very enjoyable film, providing you know how to watch old musicals / mysteries.",1
MacLaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective. This rates a 7. And try to spot Lucy in the chorus. What happened?,1
This was very obviously pre - Code.,1
"The murder mystery is good with the exception of the denouement, which is pretty flat. Victor McLaglen is something new in cops. A bizarre and bawdy camp classic highly recommended! For no Probably faulty direction.",1
Vanities is so horrifically anti - female that it's delicious. < br / > < br / > A must stroll down Memory Lane. And Duke Ellington doesn't hurt either.,1
Truly he is coming into his own. The cast does a fine job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. The fusion is highly entertaining.,1
Magnificent! This movie is wonderful.,1
I can only regard the current film on its own merits.,1
This film will be no exception to that rule.,1
"The last five minutes of the film were perfect. The scene in which Fool and Jalal were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional. All that aside, the film, I thought, was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me. And well, Parker Posey, who could complain?",1
"In the original Henry Fool, Posey played a simple woman leading a very simple life. Available within them is information that could concede the safety of the United States. < br / > < br / > Hartley, however, is simply riding on that fragmentary idea.",1
I'd buy it. I'll watch it often. Henry Fool surprised me.,1
"Her extravagant naiveté is perfect for Hartley's direction. The complexity of this film's development is unparalleled. < br / > < br / > I consider "" Henry Fool "" my least favorite of Hartley's films. This is never suspected at beginning. < br / > < br / > This is the epitome of a "" stand alone "" sequel.",1
"< br / > < br / > Hal Hartley obviously loves to play with themes. Secrets weapons research or paths to terrorists? Who knows but Henry. And that's the case with FAY GRIM, the sequel to Henry Fool. And he does so to the extreme here.",1
"In Henry Fool, the object is the memoirs... That is, in a philosophical sense, what Fay Grim is all about. Henry is a thinly veiled devil, first visiting Simon as a modern Faust, etc.",1
"< br / > < br / > Overall, it was funny ( but not slap - stick at all! Her acting was fantastic, I couldn't even tell that she was American. It kept my interest the entire time and I will be buying the DVD when it comes out!",1
"Alright, this film is the representation of several things. She seems quite mysterious, but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom. One student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries.",1
But this is where the subtlety of Fay Grim lies.,1
But this is no ordinary toy. Simon ( James Urbaniak ) is still in jail.,1
The downside?,1
"I have mixed feelings about the film and Hartley's later films in general. To those who've never seen Henry Fool, I wouldn't worry. It somehow works and doesn't work at the same time.",1
"She's at once touching, funny, cunning. In the end, it offers something that defies description. The supporting actors commit to it as well. ( I resisted temptation to turn off the DVD twice ).",1
"The plot, however, is completely different. """,1
< br / > < br / > This film is very funny. I can't wait for the third part in this story! Syrianna : of side note - Mark Cuban Exec. ?,1

It's simply magical. I won't spoil it for you.,1
"He has never been better. Slow pacing gives way to breathtaking action, and we are sucked right into vortex. What began as dark comedy morphs into romantic drama, and the transition is masterful. Although that may be redundant. And Liam Aiken is Fay's oversexed 14 year - old son.",1

"Rogers sings the catchy "" Let Yourself Go "" and later does a solo tap - dance to same tune. Quintessential Astaire and Rogers.",1
"Good but far from great. However, despite this, I was a bit disappointed in this outing. Plus, although the music is by Irving Berlin, the songs just don't seem as memorable.",1
"If Hollywood is to be believed, being in the the Navy is nothing but a bludge.",1
79 / 100.,1
Did Margaret Thatcher? ( Choreographed by Hermes Pan. ) And she's marvelous. The same avenues to romance aren't open to her. Everything works out fine. Astaire and Randolph Scott are in the Navy. It's tough enough for a homely guy.,1
"I needn't have feared, the film version is bl * * dy awesome. And you know what?",1
"< br / > < br / > Astaire and Scott are two Navy men. In it, they epitomize'30s glamor and fantasy. Rogers is vivacious, and a youthful Astaire is a dynamo. It is truly to be treasured and watched again and again.",1
Randy is in my top ten all time favorites list. This really is a great movie.,1
"How can you not like sailors dancing with each other?! Especially such a shallow and inconstant man. From a modern sensibility, it's sometimes hard to watch older films. < br / > < br / > Apart from that subplot, I did like the movie. ).",1
"Romance blooms for both couples. However, they go a bit more downscale for this 1936 outing, the fifth of their ten musicals together. Connie and Sherry inherit a steamer from their father, but they need money to keep it afloat.",1
WWII was still a few years away.,1
I like Hilliard.,1
"Pretty good though. Great versatility and artistry. She had a varied career, becoming the more famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here she is touching without being sentimental.",1

Ulrich Seidl must be a very strong man. I confess to only watching the first half hour ( for now ). Oh no!,1
Therefore... 10 / 10.,1
that blonde guy is a genius actor. yes his dog gets killed. if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal. this ain't a rosy picture of world but it's not... completely hopeless.,1
Probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong - due to good visualization. There is a middle - aged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a ( violent ) master. ).,1
Maybe you'll end up like them. And you SEE the people. I guess Hundstage is such a movie.,1
"I, myself, can't say I had a lot of fun watching it. Kind of like Tarkovsky films, but different in a way. But this one's an outstanding piece on its own.",1
"And at the low end of the oppression chain, mostly women. Without any glitter, and most disturbingly, without any hope. However it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles I fear, as subtitles can´t transport accentuation. < br / > < br / > A movie showing this as brutally as Hundstage is surely tough to face, but having to endure such lives, is even tougher. I sure do know such people. Somewhere the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place, somewhere hopes have to shatter.",1
""". If that's good or bad is up to you!",1
< br / > < br / > The despair in the film is palpable. An abusive man mistreats his woman but she forgives him time and again. It is a thought - provoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole.,1
I'm also a huge Sci - Fi / Fantasy fan.,1
So real is the visceral feeling of the viewer... Hundstage is no exception.,1

That is generally the problem with some movies. Now on the Blu Ray scale.,1
"A lot of people found this annoying ; I find it raises a smile. Whatever was great about the original has been streamlined. < br / > < br / > It's an update of the movie that shares its name.

"A remake of the 1974 cult hit, this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertaining. Just be wary of other drivers fighting for a pole position as you leave the theatre.

It is great slapstick. The Russo Brothers did a fine job directing.,1

"Riley with his little baby and wife in jail. Toto with his pants. and all others. This fact goes beyond comedy into the soul of that criminals. Everyone gave their part of brilliance from this movie cast. This movie is remake of Italian comedy "" I Soliti Ignoti "". Because of one difference.",1

But I join in regret that ALL the meaning in today's teenager's talk may be expressed by cusswords.,1
Why can't we find such talent here in the U. S.?,1
OK here is how I do this. The epic scenes were believable. The Action was fun and exiting. I grade movies on 10 components. Cast - I give this component 10 points.,1

"gitwisters. But this story is based on actual events. OK, so the FX are not high budget.",1

"If only everyone could have such an attitude. The movie makes the very same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. Having read the original story, I must say I cannot agree. Now, eight viewings later, it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time I saw it. < br / > < br / > I think just about everyone can relate to The Grinch's terrible experiences in school.",1

It is just like book. It is a movie any age can enjoy.,1

You think you've had it tough?,1
Highly recommended for teens and adults.,1
Well done!,1
Mostly by Robert Deniro.,1
A wonderful film.,1
Certainly not at the risk of his life. Cuba Gooding saved an otherwise badly done movie.,1
I was more than surprised by it.,1
You bet.,1

Please watch this movie.,1
"The title indicates the source of their bond. And it is great because of its focus on values. It will be seen many times in future, I'm sure.",1
That's not good enough for Gooding who applies to become a Navy deep sea diver. I'm certainly glad that a film was made about Carl Brashear's amazing life story.,1

This is probably the best I've seen him. This film is probably most like ` GI Jane'since it focuses on the desegregation angle.,1
"Just Enjoy Yourself. Madhuri Dixit does a cameo as herself in the song "" Makhna "". The conmen have no heroines. She dances like wind. < br / > < br / > Viju Shah's music is awesome. Asrani shines in a brief role. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, pales in comparison with him.",1
< br / > < br / > The songs.... It is a imitation of Bad Boys obviously! It was the all round Bollywood action / comedy movie.,1
All in all it remains pleasant trifle showcasing a beautiful and charismatic actress. In its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period Les Grandes Manouvres which is no bad thing.,1
"This, Renoir proudly suggests, is what the true French do best. < br / > < br / > Filmed in vibrant Technicolor,'Elena and her Men'looks terrific as well, a flurry of bright colours, characters and costumes. Throughout the early 1950s, following her scandalous marriage to Italian Roberto Rossellini, Bergman temporarily fell out of public favour.",1

"It felt like real life. But it did not come easily, and not just by singing a song or two. My expectations were quite high for this film.",1
"The town he visits, or rather revisits, is, unbeknownst to the townsfolk, place of his childhood. This film's structural similarity with the likes of The Full Monty, Brassed Off, Calendar Girls and On a Clear Day shows its indebtedness to the formula. < br / > < br / > Its success as a crowd pleaser comes from two facts. The same year and with a similarly Swedish breeze, The Queen of Sheba's Pearls did it, and Babette's Feast also comes to mind.",1

I'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation ( Of which it could be said I am one at 47! ). Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be well proud.",1
One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. All of you must watch this. Perfection!,1
without doubt. < br / > < br / > the best documentary series ever made?,1
I would have to say it was worth the effort. Marie owns a retail shop and she provides for Alex. Alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants. There is hope! He lives with an older woman called Marie.,1
"In addition, some of the footage is in color. Remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. There is one episode that's dedicated to the Holocaust. The series ends with the episode Remember ; the war's influence in a post - war world. Each episode is like a mini - film.",1
The historical research is virtually flawless.,1
Spoiler - we win.,1
You'll be so glad you did. It expands their critical thinking.,1
These things could happen to anyone. Then the movie starts. And the things they say are totally understandable. Deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts ; no complexity inside of her mind. She's isolated. Look the contrast between them.,1

I really liked this movie... it was cute. You will enjoy it!,1
"There's been a lot of movies lately based on video games, and I think this in one of them. But it does follow parts of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out. And some of these games actually won Parents'Choice Gold Awards.",1

It's so cool!,1
"Is it possible to have two lovers? At first we think it might be all about what will happen to Alexandre, but we're mistaken. The women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around, talking on and on, for something to sink in.",1

I definitely recommend watching it.,1
"She is still good enough to get boys'attentions but she also knows how present poise and self respect. Five Stars Andrew Fleming's film is indeed a modern marvel, a comeback to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in Hollywood.",1

This film is a great adventure. Jake Speed is a hero.,1

"Arms and the Man is excellent comedic theater and is definitely one of Shaw's best works. The play has flashing wit, buoyant humor and bitter sarcasms. Arms and the Man, proves that notion to be false. You're only an amateur ; you think fighting is an amusement "". She is shocked, one night by the arrival of an enemy soldier.",1
The plots are generally clever. The other players are letter perfect. Enjoy this for what it is.,1
"While the best of Shaw has always been his ideas and his dialogue rather than his bare plots, in ARMS AND THE MAN, the plot sparkles as well and the master manages happy endings for all concerned. Whenever the world sinks into strife, ARMS AND THE MAN seems to soar as ever more timely and relevant.",1
That's it.,1
"Certainly, either one towers over that Hollywood camp - riot starring Peter Ustinov.",1
Wow! It was amazing!,1
"There is a nice little story beneath the runway model approach in this film. It has the great triangular shaped headlights. See if you can find that one. The hair styles, male and female are gorgeous.",1
It's a must see for the Arthur Conan Doyle fans.,1
At the end Holmes goes with Watson to burglarize Milverton's home.,1

The film is resonant with Eustache'personal experiences.,1
"The effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable. Matt Greenberg and Sci - Fi should be commended, and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD edition of the show. The show's low points are still entertaining, and I've never seen such taut pilot episodes.",1
"See for yourself, a real adventure!",1
The tweedy professor - types thought they had it all figured out. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. Wonderful.,1
"Actually, it is not so brutal. Is this post - modern man?",1

"It immerses you into the world of a future Paris. It is noir - ish. There is some action, and even a car chase. It is not quite dystopian. The facial expressions are amazing!",1
"< br / > < br / > The year is 2054. Presented in stark black - and - white, the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based, and the futuristic city of Paris looms ominously above us.

2054. Worth a look.,1
The pacing and plot development are marvelous and the dialogs crisp.,1
One the whole its well worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have it! The story line is great and well composed ; you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it. I would almost give it 10 out of 10.,1
Add a detective story and you've got an interesting film.,1
"The initial woman storms out, and she is kidnapped.",1
"Okay I'll stop. But it sure is fun. 9 / 10 - 30 minutes of pure holiday terror. Bwahahahahha. Okay, so it's not that scary.",1
"< br / > < br / > Pixar are the animation masters. It is almost a clever use of pathetic fallacy, and is finely directed also.",1
"On rare occasions the emotions in the voices don't quite match those on screen ; something that should really have been avoided. Although the animation in Renaissance is certainly stunning and incredibly well - accomplished, I never felt like I was seeing something that hasn't been done before. Every second of the film is gorgeous.",1
"Old news. Really nice work. First, it is well executed. This is to be applauded.",1
"The atmosphere, the music, the characters, their lines, the plot are all nice and endearing.",1
I would recommend it. Whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer.,1
"There's no need for that however! "". Animation always seems to be fringe. < br / > < br / > That was one of my fears for this movie. If you're a normal person you will get scared by this. It was awesome.",1
"Picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper - stylized black and white visuals of Frank Miller's Sin City. < br / > < br / > Genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair, especially in a contemporary context, with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted. Then picture a dystopian, science fiction thriller, such as Steven Spielberg's Minority Report or Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly.",1
This one is the 1st.,1
Vive la France!,1
"It goes one step further than Sin City, and it does it well. It's style is definitively unique and very well made.",1
3D grafics look 2D. A BW comic book brought to life. One of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction.,1
< br / > < br / > Definite worth seeing. then you will be fine.,1
"It is also a watchable story, even if it isn't perfect. Sadly, Renaissance has had similarly revelatory trailer makers.",1
"< br / > < br / > That same cannot be said of Renaissance. The locations are great, too ( I want to visit the nightclub ). There are flaws in its plot, but I'll get to that later.",1
It's a vision.,1
"< br / > < br / > Nevertheless, I regret a few mistakes. The Those little things makes it a 7 / 10. It is far closer to a good film noir. I haven't been disappointed.",1
No one makes films like this.,1
Just like the first episode ; karma.,1
This is an important film.,1
This is weird wild stuff.,1
The first film ever made. < br / > < br / > worse is the historical reality of the film. The truth. These factory workers are Lumiere employees. < br / > < br / > But consider this short again.,1
A movie to venerate! What a moment! And above all the shot is a beautiful shot!,1
It's utterly pointless to rate this film.,1
"Until the photograph started to move. It The idea wasn't entirely new ( Le Prince shot the first movie as early as 1888 ), but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary. The film shows the many workers of the Lumière factory as they walk through the gates of the factory, leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work. < br / > < br / > "" La Sortie Des Usines Lumière "" would become the first in the long series of "" actuality films "" that Lumière would produce over the years.",1
Fifty seconds.,1
"At the time, of course, their ` cinematograph'must have bewildered their peers, including their subjects. This one - minute film is arguably the first movie ever made.",1
When they are all out the doors close again. One simple reason : it is only fifty seconds long.,1
"It was located at Montplaisir in the suburbs of Lyon, France. All films made before 1912 really need to be viewed with a sense of time and place. < br / > < br / > During 1894, Louis Lumiere applied himself to the task of inventing a moving - picture camera. It was electrically operated ( using power from from heavy storage batteries.",1
"Overall, I was impressed with the movie, in that it followed book very well.",1
< br / > < br / > Be sure to read great novel.,1
"Yes, it is alive. The results are predictable. But I liked it anyway.",1
I give it a 10 / 10 overall an Excellent movie and a must see.,1
< br / > < br / > Such movies are like leap years. So little is known about both of them and this movie describes them uniquely. They come after only so much time.,1
Little did Harilal knew about his aptitude and he gets emotionally carried away with small pleasures in life and fails in front of the huge idol of his father. It had the best drafted speech with a subtle humour & a veiled threat to the British raj in India!,1
"A son marries his childhood sweetheart, upsetting his father. < br / > < br / > The film does not debunk Gandhi and his ideals. The events in the film are mostly real.",1
The acting by a small cast is pretty good. This time there are Christmas themed opening & closing Crypt Keeper ( John Kassir ) segments complete with the usual puns.,1
!,1
Jaihind.,1
"Certainly not an overview film like Kingsley's Gandhi, or abstract as Kamal Hassan's Hey Ram. Though, the movie's background score and the father - son and mother - son moments are just a brilliant treat. It's borderline to that. 7. somewhere, the plot is lost and when you expect absolute epitome of emotions, nothing comes to you. < br / > < br / > This movie could have been great.",1
It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. < br / > < br / > Overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.,1
"We never really understand why he turned to Islam, and then back again to Hinduism. Show us incidents of their early conflict. The thing is, we never really understand Harilal at all. Words are not enough, show us how these incidents shaped character of Harilal Gandhi.",1
"Only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve. "" Well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream! As from old E. C. comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for!",1
"8 / 10 "" Gandhi as a husband and father? "" I would recommend it as "" must - watch - once "".",1
Costume looks and match with context. First Akshay. He performed well and with quite an ease.,1
"Gandhi My Father is a well made movie. Somewhere, the character looked incomplete.",1
There was a Sacred Silence... NOT ONE! Akshaye Khanna has proved himself to be a Top Actor.,1
Jeez.,1
William H. Macy is bomb.,1
"The best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding. No surprises there, since you know they're going to triumph. ), but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that.",1
"( Good to see Louise Lasser getting work, too. ) There are people who should not see this movie.",1
"As it is, it looks like something George Romero might have devised. Furious ( Ben Stiller ), who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day. < br / > < br / > "" Mystery Men "" opens on a party at a nursing home. And Rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre. I've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time. """,1
I love this movie! Hilarious I thought.,1
"By way, this particular reviewer watches it every Christmas on routine.",1
There are many problems with Mystery Men. The special effects detract from the story and are not really that special. < br / > < br / > Now onto the decent parts.,1
"Ben Stiller breathes such life into this character, you can't help but love him. * * * * * * WARNING : MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * * * * * * * * * * * * * * < br / > < br / > So who are these "" Mystery Men? "" ).",1
Where have we heard that before.,1
A very big surprise.,1
It doesn't mock just any old thing. Much funnier ; also much more endearing.,1
David has dreams that warn him of the future. The photography is also quite good.,1
Just look at the cast! ).,1
"BUY this film! Oh, and Ms. Garafolo is in it.",1
more than once.... enjoy!,1
This is a great movie.,1
"The dialogue is witty, and the performances given by Stiller, Macy, Azaria and Garofalo are exemplary. The funniest of all, however, has to be when the team actually attempts to rescue Captain Amazing. Mr.",1
This one is a must buy. This movie was a brilliant concept. Esp.,1
"Also, a little of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go a long way.",1
This is no regular comic superhero movie!,1
"The writing is good, and the cast is GREAT. And on that basis, it was a success.",1
AKA I got a little bored in spots. Like Aussie response Malick! I might just need to watch it again though.,1
Furious's desires.,1
"This was executed again in the mediocre, direct - to - video "" The Specials "" as well. They made Mr. < br / > < br / > The story : a bunch of low - level superheroes save the day. ). When I came back home, I went to see it again.",1
La da da de de.,1
"the programme just really went downhill and lost its luster. i saw the last episode. i would have liked to know what happened after. if you're gonna have new people at least keep them. LOL. i must say the last few seasons were absolutely terrible. and they got rid of Libby! they were most funniest, most entertaining and most um... good.",1
I was gutted when they decided to finish it!,1
I used to love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and have seen every single episode.,1
I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. Not having Hilda and Zelda seemed wrong somehow and Miles was gone just like that. Magical.,1
"< br / > < br / > Well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout. Yuppie lawyer Chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man's court. Yet, it's also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave. And then there're those scary dreams that come and go at odd times. Audiences can readily identify with them.",1
< br / > < br / > Alicia is made to go to the hospital by school principal.,1
The sitcom revolved around a girl who must learn to be responsible for her own actions.,1
"because a lot of good characters disappeared later on. i really liked the first 2 seasons. but i still like to watch it, but the only reason i watch later seasons is because of sabrina.",1
And why did the aunts have to disappear out of the show for good? But there are a lot of questions unanswered. Too bad hes too old for me though. I used to love the magic of Sabrina and the teenage witch. I really hope that she picks Harvey! I'm sure the ending went to be perfect. And I want to see the last episode of S. T. T. W!,1
"Each episode had a maniac, zany energy and rapid - fire pacing that overcame the occasional awkward joke. Melissa Joan Hart exuded a keen talent for physical comedy, particularly in her facial expressions. For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a gem hidden away on TGIF ( and later, early school - day afternoon reruns ). The final season, where Sabrina works at a pop culture magazine, was unequivocally disappointing.",1
The best season is probably 3...,1
"I would recommend this to any family because the television series is clean, funny and adventurous. Classic!",1
": ) She's funny, smart, outgoing, witty, and a lot more.",1
"Not to put down Hilda and Zelda. Unfortunately, the latest I could get is the first college season. As a child they always talk about how he does not want to be an exterminator like his Dad. Melissa Joan Hard is beautiful and was perfect for the Sabrina with her Perky personality. But I would have liked to have seen it. I loved Roxy and Mortgan ; they were so talented! When Sabrian moved into the house that season, they never really explain how it happened.",1
"I've heard from a doctor before that everything that I've mentioned above leads to a healthy "" hart ""... and isn't that what we all need? : ) I was inspired... and why?",1
Those episodes were great. He was HOT.,1
"However, sweet'n'sexy Cinderella ( radiant blonde cutie pie Catherine Erhardt ) remains determined to change things for the better. In the grim totalitarian future of 2047 sex has been deemed an illegal act by the Big Brother - like impotent bumbling idiot the Controller ( an amusingly goofy Erwin Fuller ).",1
"it would have been better ( although this of course was covered, I don't think it got as much time as it warranted ). It was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these stories, and then be unable to see them. I felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport, the ideology of the sport, etc.",1
"I must really love it, right? It would have been good to see some of them. Not a single wave is ridden start to finish. The same sentiment shows up in the main production. Mavericks is not just a bad acid trip. At times, the editing reduces the movie to the inscrutable. It must be a couple of frames in length at max. ).",1
"It is the joy of exhalation. d's ( again, perhaps ). It has no guns. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism.",1
Who are you? Do the aborigines? But it finally got to me. Here's a scene. Does the entirety of Sidney?,1
"What was the biggest boost to the sport? I saw the first, not the others. < br / > < br / > A rousing musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story. Wonderful.",1
There is a gritty reality to the sport as well.,1
I was never happier. We used to watch 16mm films at the local high schools in SoCal.,1
Only brave people can do it.,1
Cut to Noll and you know you're in for a treat!,1
< br / > < br / > Thorough worth watching.,1
< br / > < br / > This a great film.,1
See it. I stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked. Half way into this movie you'll want to go off and learn to surf as well.,1
I got nothing more to say. Now for the film. What do I mean?,1
Why?,1
Enjoy!,1
"And the storybook history of Laird Hamilton, today's surfing icon. < br / > < br / > All this, and the movie has more. He was deeply moved by the audience reception of him and film. Wow!",1
"This is what really attracted me to this film. In Riding Giants, we have a very small cast of veterans and newbies. How does it do this?",1
")! 1 nemesis, Gary Merrill ( who had himself been the protégé of Andrews Snr.",1
Excellent.,1
"Every crime drama seems to be a "" noir "". Okay. But now he's committed multiple felonies. "" At least I think they must be multiple.",1
Good silent drama.,1
< br / > < br / > 8 out of 10. Great lighting and mood setting.,1
"You'll enjoy this, but you can't miss that. Sgt. But he's pretty vicious for a good guy.",1
"At least, he finally admits to what he has done. As a result of his bitterness, Mark doesn't know when to stop using his hands.",1
"Dana Andrews is one of those actors that I've probably seen in a dozen films, but who has never really registered for me.",1
"into his nostrils each time he talks to Dixon. Good cop but getting out of control easy. Dixon knows it well : "" Who killed him ( Paine )? Why is it that he hates them so much? ). Playmates!",1
Dana Andrews stars as a hot - headed detective who all too often uses his fists instead of his brains. This time he does NOT use excessive force but the assailant is killed. This is the way Noir was meant to be.,1
"Andrews, on other hand, has rarely been better, exhibiting a toughness and unhinged anger that I hadn't expected of him. ' The sidewalk represents respectability, integrity and morality only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter.",1
Dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river.,1
"We don't just see and hear the city at night ; we feel it because Preminger lets us see and hear even the most peripheral and distant factors of it. The troubled man reclaims himself with his own tangled impression of rectitude. As the plot develops, he is secretly entangled in situational snares, yet he is renewed by the outward acts that can be seen in the vintage noir protagonist's visceral facial expressions before he executes them. But there is an expressionistic matter - of - < br / > < br / > Dana Andrews furnishes a complex character unfolded through his streaks of violence and the hatred that always infests him.",1
DVD brings the movie to life again and I saw it differently.,1
"As his girl, Gene Tierney is attractive but unremarkable.",1
"He was doing fairly well digging himself into and out of a big hole, but she was just too much light at the end of the tunnel for a noir film.",1
"Gene Tierney does a solid job in her role, as much as it is, being a sweet shoulder for Dixon. He's the perfect film noir anti - hero - he's not very nice all the time, but we still root for him.",1
"Ah, noir.",1
"With no better suspects, Jiggs is arrested and charged. Mark Dixon ( Andrews ) despises criminals, as his own father was a crook. "".",1
"Now he must cover up the murder. If you like film noir, this is a must - see.",1
< br / > < br / > This movie belongs to Andrews. You could easily see both movies side by side for a textbook compare and contrast session.,1
"And this time, he's got the same co - stars : DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY.",1
< br / > < br / > The role of Mark Dixon gives Dana Andrews one of the most interesting parts of his career.,1
"He does his best to cover it up. But that's where most of the comparisons end. Overall, it's an amazingly well made film. Sgt.",1
And boy didn't they had have it coming?,1
"< br / > < br / > Of course, that's far from an end to it. Realizing that his job's already on line, Andrews dumps the body in the river after making it look like the suspect had taken a powder. But they're wildly dissimilar films, set in different strata of New York ( not to mention at opposite poles of the noir universe ).",1
We're a long way from LAURA.,1
"But that's really not the point. < br / > < br / > For UK readers, DMAX ( Sky channel 155 ) have just started ( Jan 2008 ) daily re - runs of Airwolf. Sometimes it failed, but often it succeeded admirably - and on a TV budget to boot.",1
!,1
I vaguely remember the theme song.,1
"The Last Wave'is far more than the sum of its parts. The incidental music is unobtrusive, never trying to be grandiose. ' Strongly recommended.",1
"Olivia's "" my girl "" and I love her work.",1
"There's a key, I feel, in his relationship with his ex - wife Britta ( Signe Hasso ). Marriage implies a "" union of the soul "" in the traditional conception. He says that he never would have or could have become a good actor without her inspiration. It's unusual that the male and female protagonists are divorced at the beginning of the film.",1
George Cukor directs a brooding and cynical classic.,1
Yet the court decided to prosecute the five for his death charging them with manslaughter instead of murder.,1
Excellent film.,1
He put into that character all his talent and sincerity. I would see this movie repeatedly and never feel bored.,1
"Ultimately, it leads him to the depths of insanity and murder. I just saw it again and loved it. And, much more serious, he begins to see and hear his play even in regular everyday life. Ronald Colman plays a famous Broadway actor who has begun to lose his mind and sense of identity.",1
It became his best known part.,1
"I can add Sidney Carton and Rudolf Rassendyll to this list. I have my doubts on either level - but it is among his best known roles. Let's take the second point first. She demands that "" Tony "" leave, saying she won't see him. But here he is not heroic.",1
"Joe. Tony tells her his name is Martin. "".... Hamlet. Then he says : "" Or Paul.",1
I stumbled on this late last night n TCM.,1
or at least a remake.,1
"< br / > < br / > I think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system. However, the graphics during game play aren't quite up to that standard. Legend of Dragoon is one of those little - known games that people either love or hate.",1
Final Fantasy eat your heart out!! !,1
< br / > < br / > A definite 10 out of 10. But this is different than Final Fantasy. I remember this game. And I believe it should be made into a movie.,1
I absolutely love this game to death. Ever since I was 9 years old ( I am now 15 ).,1
I really miss the show.,1
Others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal. The director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off. One of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history. These attitudes are on the way out.,1
< br / > < br / > Highly recommend for Ulli Lommel fans. So what. Don't believe the hype. This is a gritty and street level horror film. Can this killer be stopped? Is David Hess still the man? < br / > < br / > This film is NOT about original Zodiac killer.,1
This episode is a bit confusing. Delusional.,1
"However, this can not be called a pure thriller.",1
If you like that you will like this. Girl Interrupted comes to mind. Which gave it no chance to be seen. If you haven't see this movie you should. AGHhh.,1
"Only Chloe believe on his words, but she is also considered insane.",1
Lana is devoted to him. < br / > < br / > This episode is utterly mind - blowing and shocking.,1
What was in Marishka mind? Where's Mammy? What?,1
I love Romy Schneider movies. I loved this movie. So yea.,1
"What would it be showed like? < br / > < br / > The movie is almost identical. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! And now...? They are strikingly similar.",1
Truman's book was in fact not 100 % true to the real story.,1
He said that Bible is the best of all books. This was a pretty good film.,1
"I got the DVD and watched it last night. I thought, OK cool... ! One minute?",1
There is no need for more words.,1
"This movie has thought occur to him, but too late. Why the Clutters didn't try this, I have no idea.",1
"To him, both men HAD to die for his book to succeed. Shame and guilt. < br / > < br / > Capote's book is not truth. It is not factual or journalistic.",1
Its not every time old ones are that good. This are my opinions.,1
She learns how to control the machine ( with some uncertainty about time of day ). ( < br / > < br / > The film is not a work of serious science fiction.,1
Does anyone know if he'played in over movies or TV shows?,1
"Now, I really must read original book, as soon as possible. Both are in abundance in this film.",1
"This is a legitimate question but, according to the reverend, the Church answers all mysteries.",1
It's a nice family movie.,1
"It is an excellent film, in its own right, and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film. ', but this is wrong, for alcohol isn't her problem - nor is her chain smoking. You're great!",1
"Otherwise, "" as he said, "" what am I doing? """,1
It's a daringly abstract premise. That is perhaps what makes it so intense.,1
< br / > < br / > I always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with an actor.,1
I spent 5 hours drenched in this film.,1
"She's in a crisis. The movie has a slow pace and a dark, moody, frightening quality.",1
"The ending is a little ambiguous but I take it literally, it's the easiest way out and scariest. Uh huh. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended. OK, a man has died but it wasn't exactly a normal killing. The Aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans.",1
< br / > < br / > Almost - but not quite. The film is superb.,1
"She starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that doesn't help to much and Myrtle is one step away from complete madness. Both movies are simply amazing, they have a richness of ideas hard to grasp at first sight.",1
10 / 10.,1
10 / 10.,1
It's just perfect.,1
"Never before have inner demons been so exposed physically. But then, he always was intelligent, he just never flapped it around for easy praise. < br / > < br / > It's about the mystery of becoming, performing, and acting. Who is this dead girl?",1
"00. He also had FACES ( 1968 ). A few minutes later, this fan is hit by a car and killed. Yesterday, I went to the monthly Antique Flea Market that comes to town.",1
So this movie might not be suitable for everybody. I love De Palma! ).,1
Remember? Mission : Impossible also. Before I watched this movie ( today!,1
I like Ghost stories.,1
keith gordon is gorgeous.,1
"Rated. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known for mixing blood - soaked death with macabre humor.",1
"What surprises me is what cuts he wanted. These are the ones to get, if you can find a copy. He does not. But there are a few complications. But some copies of DePalma's original cut still exist. A hooker ( Nancy Allen ) is the sole witness to the murder.",1
"Highly recommended. It's taut, stylish and extremely suspenseful mixture of sex and violence. """,1
"but i digress. i guess you could call this scene soft core porn. to me, this music really elevated the movie. the film is very well paced. there is very little violence and blood.",1
May contain minor spoilers. And there's a split screen scene that I thought was almost classic. As a thriller it's tense and quite often believable.,1
Its a bootleg.,1
The film tacks on a needless & unnecessary twist ending that I didn't really see point of. I'd imagine that every shot in Dressed to Kill had a great deal of thought put into it.,1
"He refuses, and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled. < br / > < br / > The sequence begins with Angie at an art museum. She watches strangers, all involved in sexual or family activities, then begins to get turned on to a man sitting next to her. She then goes to her therapy session, where she complains about her dead marriage, before attempting to seduce her therapist, Michael Caine.",1
Keith Gordon as her son Peter is brilliant. The atmosphere is right there.,1
Dressed to Kill is a must see for all cinema fans. Michael Cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist. It's a truly edge of your seat shocker.,1
The Acting is amazing!. Dennis Franz is good as the detective. ). ( Caine Rules! This is a taut suspenseful masterpiece from Brian De Palmawith amazing performances all around!.,1
The prostitute is the sole witness of the crime. The audience is easily glued in front of the screen.,1
It's odd then that director Brian De Palma was basically trying to crib Hitchcock. The similarities don't end there. < br / > < br / > Dressed to Kill is somewhat important historically. Quite a few scenes approach soft - core porn.,1
David Birney played her husband. I highly recommend story.,1
"It is highly successful on a visceral level and I actually get involved / interested with these characters. < br / > < br / > And to top it all off, it has a professional and believable cast. < br / > < br / > 8 / 10 There's a bit of trivia for you.",1
"It is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of film medium. That scene alone, pretty much represents everything I want to see in a film. If I was a film director, that would be the kind of thing I'd like to do. "" Not for the faint of heart!",1
I give it a 6. I didn't remember him in it. Dealers skit is pretty cool too.,1
I give a 7.,1
Sadly this movie is dated.,1
I was born in 1982.,1
Each one! Where do you get a copy? It was that funny.,1
producer.,1

I highly recommend this vid. One of the best things to come along in 1972 was Groove Tube.,1
"but trust me, it's funny stuff. Just look at any video made in the 1980's. of recognition on the'virgin's'face. """,1
Ewww! ) Chevy Chase and Richard Belzer made their feature film debuts here.,1
Really funny.,1
The Groove Tube.,1
"( That is Shapiro, not Nat King Cole singing Just You, Just Me ). It can't!",1
Bring it on.,1
"LOU "" is such a film.",1
Bravo on next level of cinema.,1
Soooo much love... sooo many blessings. What was this costing me?,1
I feel like its a quirky Gem for the self - help market.,1
Needless to say I was enthralled throughout the whole movie.,1
The intention and the message is clear and profound.,1
Men admired him and women dreamed about him. He did most of his own stunts.,1
I won't spoil the end.,1
Do see it! And what a gem Marcel Herrand is as the megalomanous and lust - driven King Louis XV!,1
see it.,1
< br / > < br / > The setting is clearly modeled on Paraguay. He sports a deliberately obvious blond dye job. This is due to the country's having fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries.,1
"His co - star, Mr. Julia, played his role equally as perfect.",1
This movie is fun to watch.,1
"The Winters character, supposedly a salesman, is actually a CIA operative. < br / > < br / > A very good film, not a big blockbuster, but very entertaining.",1
"< br / > < br / > All in all, a memorable romp under Paradorian moon. You get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes.",1
he was beat.,1
"No matter what they do in this movie, they pull it off. Definitely worth seeing.",1
and hold off the rebels?,1
< br / > < br / > A ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator.,1
In fifty years we will have the proof.,1
"But before he can leave town with the magnificent prize, Dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle and skips town fast. The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam pursuing the man who killed his father. The support cast isn't too bad either. The men instead square up in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that Lin eventually wins.",1
"He had got the weapon by cheating Dutch Henry at poker. As in most of them Stewart's hero has an violent edge that threatens to explode at any time. Young Bull is killed during the attack and the gun passes to Steve. It turns out that Dutch Henry is also in town for the rifle shoot. """,1
"I'll come clean. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later.",1
Meanwhile the starring is going on the vengeance. The breathtaking cinematography by Greta Garbo's favourite photographer Willian Daniels.,1
They wouldn't stand a chance!,1
Too bad it wasn't photographed in Technicolor.,1
There are many classic moments in this movie. Will it get back to the right owner? Stewart is the right man to play the lead.,1
"The weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably. The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness.",1
"Stewart does, of course, since he won it. This is because of the noir edge.",1
"One scene in particular serves to explain his Mann's use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns. ( I would be remiss in not recognizing cinematographer William H. Daniels's contribution, particularly his superlative day - for - night, open - range photography. ) Nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue, relying on actors'eyes or a well - chosen image to convey the stakes.",1
"This really is a standout and of course the first of the Mann - Stewart pairings. Decaf no doubt. : - ) Enjoyed it so much I ordered the DVD. Worth the shot, I repeat. Saw this flick on ENCW last nite for the third or fourth time. Steve Miller ( not The Joker ) is interesting as a handsome would be hero who's interested in Lola but too yellow.",1
< br / > < br / > It's also a really great looking movie. But it's no criticism really.,1
"Not that he wasn't already a multi - talented Hollywood star. He had even done westerns before. But to most movie goers he was the all - American boyscout type Mr. Smith or George Bailey. < br / > < br / > Anthony Mann was associated with B flicks in the film noir mode. "" The whites want revenge. The year is 1876.",1
Enjoy!,1
Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull. < br / > < br / >.,1
The picture has plenty of action and suspense as Stewart closes in on his quarry.,1
"In other words, it's a seminal work. The dialogue, the pacing and Mann's direction are excellent. < br / > < br / > "" Winchester'73 "" is a joy to watch.",1
All of them are fun to watch.,1
"Philosophically, Duryea explains he can wait. Eventually it does return to Stewart. Every character has a wide variety of experiences. Drake is aware of this lapse, and it helps lead to his destruction.",1
"In The Gunfighter, he's the town marshal expected to arrest Ringo but once rode with him in an outlaw gang. The final battle between good and bad brothers, high atop a series of jutting rock canyons, is now legendary among western buffs.",1
"It was to be made into a Fritz Lang film, which did not come through. Shelley Winters, the leading lady was far from virtuous, she kept following the man who stayed with the rifle. He was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized, far from the average good guy. With Winchester, Mann created a different conception of western, but still maintaining all its traditions.",1
"< br / > < br / > WINCHESTER 73 is fraught with noir anxiety. Noir is often considered a psychological genre, visualising the traumas of its protagonist's head.",1
"And despite Sergio Leone, no one does them quite like Americans.",1
The style of filming and pacing is what hooks us to watch it.,1
!,1
Recommended in every way!,1
"At midnight? Addictive "" is an adjective I've heard many times when talking of certain TV shows. And it truly paid off.",1
"Wrong. This is New York City, the place where nobody sleeps.",1
"When an airplane explodes over the Mojave Desert, Jack has one additional issue to worry about. My vote is eight.",1
That's 72 forty minute episodes!! Season 5 ended before I even saw my very first episode. I got into the series very late. And boy was I hooked!! ! I watched the first three seasons in three weeks.,1
"My vote is seven. < br / > < br / > "" My Super Ex - Girlfriend "" is delightfully silly and funny. Jenny turns Matt's life into hell, while he has a romance with Hannah.",1
It felt like it was RUSHED into theaters.,1
Possibly a nine ( depends on how it appears on second viewing ).,1
! She was just simply FABULOUS!! This film is very highly recommended.,1
I got to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. ( 3 1 / 2 * out 5 * ) This movie is certainly not for everyone.,1
< br / > < br / > The story is quiet simple. My Super Ex - Girlfriend is an entertaining movie no more no less.,1
"( Maybe he was at a prescreening that showed more...? ) Superman surprised me with actually having me feel good ( goosebumps! ) Of those comments here before mine, I mostly agree with Edyarb's. You could see them wanting to make a joke, but no one in the audience laughed.",1
"well, this is an Ivan Reitman film.",1
Dominic Monaghan really became the insomniac. Is it a dream or reality? !,1
"And IMO, it succeeds at being a nice film. < br / > < br / > So.",1
7 / 10 my collection.,1
It was!,1
"Underrated, for sure. But I can't blame it for that.",1
"Shocking. Jenny curiously asks Matt what was G - Girl like. Luke Wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend. First off, we all love the hero. Reitman starts with a great premise, and really squanders it. Because if there is a woman who can play a Superhero, she is Thurmanshe looks great.",1
Overall I was rather impressed with the pilot. C but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that I very rarely see television tackle.,1
Caprica is set in the twelve colonies some 58 years prior to the events of Battlestar Galactica. In the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series.,1
It will be interesting to see how this plays out.,1
It's fraking entertaining! Time paradox? In the 1960's communicators were fantasy. Of course.,1
"The narration is almost hypnotizing, and from the opening lines, it is impossible to turn away. It comes very highly recommended.",1
"Paula Malcomson of "" Deadwood "" fame is terrific as his wife as well.",1
That kind of makes me happy.,1
It significantly applies most to the 2007 series. < br / > < br / > I give series 8 stars.,1
BSG is one of my all time favourite TV series.,1
Special note it was good to see Polly Walker outside of Rome!,1
The production values are incredible and the acting is first - rate. I was immediately hooked on this gorgeous new world.,1
!,1
!,1
< br / > < br / > I was wrong! ( 58 years before the events of the BSG pilot ).,1
I can't wait until next week. But it was time for it to end and the story to move on.,1
Good show. Wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something. There is moral decadence in a virtual world.,1
Well done to Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent job.,1
I look forward to the full series. Battlestar's powerful rolling drums and mournful duduks served it's themes very well. < br / > < br / > Caprica feels different.,1
< br / > < br / > I loved it. It was really very good.,1
He is without a doubt from the best of America. Those don't come along every day.,1
Bet not. Amazing to watch.,1
Both were written and played by the couple Bacri Jaoui. 88 minutes of pure bliss!,1
factor after the movie had ended.,1
Great fun.,1
This is an excellent movie.,1
Coffin ( nice name for a guy in a horror flick ) is especially bad in this case.,1
"Good stuff. If you like old horror movies, this one is worth a watch.",1
The plot? They both like to sleep in coffins.,1
A fun little view. so that his wife can keep looking beautiful. Who knows? ),1
"People, don't do it.",1
Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant.,1
Final thought seven pounds = seven Stars.,1
"< br / > < br / > I would give it 8 / 10. There is absolutely no twist whatsoever, there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening. There were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke.",1
If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan you will love it.,1
"Bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues. Someday they'll thank you for it. The script was so real it was amazing. < br / > < br / > Go BUY this film and show it to your teenage kids before it's too late. This film not only doesn't follow the formula, it shows how other events often lead up to and / or affect what happens afterwards.",1
"Will Smith's a feelgood actor, so serial killers were out. Absolutely masterful.",1
It does. I loved this movie.,1
!,1
Who knew?,1
You cannot miss a thing. I don't know how he does it. Thanks again Will. AMAZING and sad all at the same time.,1
Always he gives a record braking performance. now what is the lesson you can see that while watching. When its DVD was released i came to market and bought it.,1
"She looks beautiful & does her part extremely well. Top class cinema! Will Smith, also is the producer again with some of the others. At least that's what he thinks. You won't forget this movie easily.",1
Maybe that was the point of the film.,1
WOW!,1
"Overall, excellent movie. Great directing. Music was great.",1
< br / > < br / > This film has potential. This is one of them that can.,1
"I haven't seen him much lately, but that could just be me. First, I did like this film. < br / > < br / > It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. Excellent. It was well acted by all.",1
Remember Gabriele Muccino's name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn't quite so high - profile. Put this on your list. It's quite a versatile performance.,1
I just watched Seven Pounds. I don't know what to say.,1
Nudity : No. By the end of the movie I finally put it all together. I didn't. ). The rest of the cast were very good as well. What is his motive?,1
Give it a chance.,1
"Until then, Smith, plays it mysterious, almost stalking people. He looks like he's lost weight and is sick. You spend most of this two - hour film wondering "" what's the story regarding the lead character? "" < br / > < br / > Will Smith, as a low - key "" Ben Thomas "" will keep you guessing.",1
"It is his character, seen maybe three times, that really encompasses primal level of emotion being dealt with. Or is it a car crash?",1
"One thing I can give him a ton of credit for, the man can cry. But nevertheless it's still a good movie. Ezra remains calm and Tim decides he is worthy.",1
Don't get my wrong its not a bad short film. You can tell that it has been an act of love for her.,1
"But when things eventually fit together, wow. Thank you for the picture Will! Very true to himself.",1
It's a very layered and intelligent film.,1
! I hope it comes out on DVD soon!!!!,1
the actors were really good and i loved all the music! I just saw this film in Santa Barbara.,1
"She's also very STRIDENT throughout, which gets tiresome.",1
Vanessa Williams is a perfect fit for Rose.,1
"Otherwise the update is better in every possible way. The sets and cast really make Sweet Apple, Ohio the place to be. Sure it's long, but it's length is a testimony to how true to the original musical script the film is being. In fact, his perforamnce literally steals the show.",1
"But luckily, from what I've seen, they are in the minority when it comes to this gem. This director really knows what she's doing. The story, the visual composition and the soul of the film, which are indisputably flawless. That much is clear. The production value is very low, but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school? Pretend for a moment that the budget doesn't matter.",1
Part of that has to do with the writing. ( We loved his'Giant Step'number. ) Or never cast her to begin with. Kim's role is completely one - dimensional.,1
5 stars.,1
"Eh, maybe I'm delusional. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was that? ). He is so great! The casting for this movie was right - on ( with one exception ).",1
They put in new songs and scenes. It was lengthy for one. So what made this a TV ratings flop?,1
I think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs!,1
Very funny. The action scenes were well filmed & choreographed.,1
"Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. This is a hard to describe film ; comedy, satire, action, screwball. And as a result I was quite entertained.",1
I love most of the actors. She ain't great. Her character is odd. It makes sense.,1
What a script!,1
He portrayed angst very well.,1
"at its CORE feature is an anti - globalization gig, period. ).",1
"But, once there, Brand runs into difficulties. Brand Hauser ( John Cusack ) is an assassin for the CIA.",1
"Marisa Tomei is so attractive! ) ( My gosh, "" George Costanza "" was right.",1
The one person I was most impressed with in this film was Hilary Duff. I strongly recommend film.,1
"On other hand, if you like sly comedy and broad satire, this is for you. To be fair, they are given good material.",1
"All those critics, who shouted hoarse that Hilary cannot act, will be silent for a while. Especially, Joan's hysterics are uproarious! The film is really witty and you need to be equally clever to get all the satire. ). I have always been a huge fan of Ms. Duff.",1
"Unfortunately, they went 0 for 3 with her. Not much of it, mind, but some. He handled the small ( $ 10 million ) budget very well, stretching it to make it appear to be much more. ). The story also got a bit ludicrous at points, which is fine for a satire to a point, but it took it to a whole new level here.",1
< br / > < br / > All the elements of a great film are here.,1
It's really funny.,1
I'd say it's worth a watch.,1
"Seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely. < br / > < br / > In final act of the film, the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled. Somewhere in the mix, a pop star named Yonica Babyyeah gets thrown in. He meets a reporter ( Marisa Tomei ) and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man + a hot reporter. I thought it was executed very well, but other may disagree, and I could understand why.",1
"< br / > < br / > That's all, and it works. It isn't. Ben Kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless CIA boss.",1
My rating 8 / 10.,1
He's sooo cute! ).,1
I rate this movie 8 out of 10.,1
"Good job to this girl, I can't wait to see more! SO well written. It's undoubtedly strongest part of the film.",1
"However, how does your child react to it? Well, mine loved it more than the first. Well, maybe it isn't - to you.",1
What a mess. This is arranged by their father's accountant ( King ). The young women are pretty and all do good work.,1
"< br / > < br / > Durbin carries movie with ease. Nope. Is there any doubt that Durbin will sing a song or two in her warm, luscious soprano? She's billed last, but with the typographic equivalent of neon lights around her name.",1
She also has one of funniest lines in the film.,1
"< br / > < br / > This film is enjoyable, light fare.",1
"It has been said that Deanna Durbin invented teenagery. This first film was one of the best. Her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma, which she certainly had. Deanna herself never did.",1
You'll love it.,1
"12 Monkeys "" is evidence of Gilliam's own vision and style, as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake. "" Definitely one of my favorites. The difference between Gilliam and artsy posers is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning. His bald head is a mark of uniformity in the disease - ridden future world, yet makes him recognizable in 1996 world. This tendency for Gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art - house pretentiousness.",1
"< br / > < br / > Some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. 'sort of way.",1
I do like the end. but a big question also comes. ? So why everything is still happen?,1
"< br / > < br / > Some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. 'sort of way.",1
"The bullet - well it might be some mistake, some falsification. A very strong movie. < br / > < br / > Best. Bruce is good and Brad also.",1
In my top ten.,1
"It's so original and so entertaining. It shouldn't be a surprise though, as he does an amazing job.",1
"). But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at that ( well, almost always.",1
Brad Pitt delivers a perfect performance.,1
( In a middle of a war. ) The story of this film is truly remarkable.,1
About that.,1
A great addition to anyone's collection. < br / > < br / > The actors in this were awesome.,1
My first impression? The gorgeous Madeleine Stowe is quite a treat to watch. < I can't decide whether this is one of my favourite movies. < br / > < br / > The movie is set in the future. A virus killed 5 billion people. I definitely liked it. I have to check out his other movies.,1
"A must have for sci fi fans, or movie fan of any type really, because it includes suspense, drama, action, etc.",1
html. Whew!,1
It's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. The acting is amazing too.,1
"< br / > < br / > I watched this movie once around 10 years ago. The scenes between Jeffrey and Cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie, Pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he Gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness, perfection and originality.",1
He is gathering information.,1
"Not to change what happened ( the past is inevitable ), but make the present better. A linear travel within a non - linear structure. The world of this Terry Gilliam film is a world with little space for free - will.",1
One of my big favourites.,1
"It was entitled "" Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts "". Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing. But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness. < br / > < br / > I love Gilliam films ( Brazil, in particular ). It is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles.",1
< br / > < br / > The movie constantly plays with time. I know I did. In 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital.,1
"What we do know is that he is a man who dreams, and his dreams may have been reality : he may have already been at the scene of Event of 1996. Cole could be any person.",1
This one's a don't - miss!,1
"Just awesome. "" It is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept. Unfortunately, limitations still exist in such arrangements.",1
"Now they are set on trying to prevent virus from ever happening. He tells them the future, of course no one believes him, he goes back to the future. < br / > < br / > 12 Monkeys was an incredible film. Who knows?",1
All serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.,1
!,1
The UK had very limited access to anime. Personally i think its a big shame. I regard it as a favoured film of all time. In fact. The sync is perfect in every shot.,1
That's simply not true and a little unfair.,1
"While the plot may be somewhat cliché, it is also clever and entertaining. < br / > < br / > The film is well made, with good cinematography and fast pacing. It's also pretty sexy, with a lot of nudity and some fairly explicit sex scenes.",1
"Therefore it is Trejo, el padrino, who'adopts'Cantillana, and effectively'makes him'as a man in the city. Power relations become a vital theme, as society's outsiders merge in a mini - family.",1
< br / > < br / > Sound like a Chilean Pulp Fiction?,1
< br / > < br / > I strongly recommend it 9. This is for you.,1
Not for all people. I loved that. Hats off to the person that thought of doing this.,1
Antagonist? It really makes you think.,1
Neither can his girl back home played by Eleanor Parker.,1
It was during the bloody fighting Al was hit in the face by a Jap grenade that ended up blinding him.,1
The hunting scene is very good.,1
The Army Hospital has since become a college campus.,1
Pearl Harbor is bombed and he's off to war as millions of others were. I do wonder though whatever happened to the real Al Schmid. < br / > < br / > It's a great part for Garfield. Definitely at the top five of best John Garfield movies has to be Pride of the Marines. It's a film one shouldn't miss.,1
No matter how many.,1
And they had one here. A striking dream sequence is included.,1
This movie is a fantastic movie.,1
"My father, Dr. Gordon Warner ( ret.",1
"Bullied freshmen? A dorky music teacher ( Paul Bartel, also from "" Eating Raoul "" * )? Check. "" A real treat.",1
This is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!,1
"Not right away, anyway. What makes this movie so special, anyway?",1
"Well, simply : art. So much for heroism, but they get the job done. Everybody's got problems! When I get back, some guys won't hire me, because my name is Diamond "".",1
Goodnight Mister Tom is one of these special movies.,1
Quite a heartwarming little film and not just for the kids. Getting a boy instead she completely ignores him.,1
"Amazing! No, not at all. John Thaw is mesmerising as Tom Oakley.",1
This movie resonated with me on two levels.,1
< br / > < br / > We soon see why this child wets his bed. He comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly.,1
A great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at time.,1
Luckily I borrowed it from him and watched it on my own and I cried all through it. It is a magnificent film and I have already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends.,1
"Really heartwarming, and definitely recommended. By time William proclaimed'I CAN RIDE MY BIKE, DAD! ).",1
Very good!,1
A heartwarming film.,1
A truly heart wrenching film.,1
John Thaw is a an excellent actor.,1
Full marks.,1
I give it ten stars.,1
"All in all, a modern classic.",1
< br / > < br / > Two points of interest. Willie is played to good effect by Nick Robinson. Tom discovers again his ability to love and care.,1
sort of.,1
< br / > < br / > It just doesn't get better that that does it?,1
"Roeper may well be an idiot savant, but in some other field. It's your mind and thoughts we long for.",1
You shouldn't miss it. The second storyline is about Sam and Kate Barlow. The film's dramatization at some points is very well done. The film is reasonably easy to understand.,1
"Holes "" is my all - time favorite movie! 10 out of 10 stars, I definitely recommend it for everyone to see! """,1
Louis Sachar thats who. It brings out the child in everyone.,1
( I liked it. ),1
Disney has done it again.,1
I give this movie a 9.,1
!,1
It was best that way. What a GREAT movie!,1
"This movie should be on your top 5 "" to See "" list!!! ! My sister, who is 9, and I watched it and absolutely loved it!",1
< br / > < br / > The casting was very good. I would most certainly watch this again!,1
"Folks, let me tell you I wasn't disappointed. "" Most recommended!",1
Holes is an awesome movie. But not with Holes.,1
"There is no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard, for example.",1
But for what reason? All the cast are great.,1
The other plus is in the casting.,1
"Holes "" is a movie that is smart and beautiful. A must watch! For the first time events are not explained in details.",1
Just loved it. Hmmmmmmmmm.,1
"He "" dug "" himself into the role. ( 6 ) I love the choice of settings for the movie.",1
"The novel takes more time in developing the characters. It works a lot better. I also don't like the multitude of pop songs. But, to my surprise, I absolutely loved Holes. 9 / 10. It is an intelligent story, and it's very well told. Jon Voight is especially great.",1
"3. Brilliant actors. Louis Sachar! And I'm serious! The one - liners in this are smart, funny and unpatronising.",1
The only down side?,1
ITS AWESOME! Hello.,1
"Jon Voight is especially nasty and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.",1
"` I've never been to camp before,'says Stanley. He is unlucky in life. Holes is a story about Stanley Yelnats IV. Green Lake seems is, in many ways, a haunted place.",1
"So what who gave him the job? Coppola did. They said exactly that in film. These are the only people they are trying to "" disassociate from "" and for good reasons! They recognize that SF is close to LA which is a benefit. Of course you don't know it because you are so LA jaded. How is he not to be considered that? And who directed The Godfather? And that proves your point how? How can you say that Francis Ford Coppola is the "" so called "" San Francisco director? Don't be so sensitive! And so what if Sophia wants to live in LA?",1
I love this movie.,1
"Sure, these are just some cute kids having fun. This adds a new angle to the film. These guys have. And, many of issues with which they were dealing are still running between them two decades later. On the surface this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80's by a group of upper class neighborhood kids. But, this is also much more. As we get older we tend to forget how overwhlelming the realities of life were when we were little.",1
< br / > < br / > Totally amazing!,1
of flamboyance at an early age. I couldn't stop laughing watching this film.,1
I also didn't realize the series flopped.,1
There is a moral to each story. It is entertaining.,1
"However, I still like the light and humorous attitude of show. After watching the first episode I could see why people were turned off at first. I absolutely love this show, but I saw the second episode first.",1
"< br / > < br / > And what stunts! "" ( I urge you to read his mini - bio. )",1
"< br / > < br / > Zorro's Fighting Legion is a bit different from other Zorro films. < br / > < br / > Another big difference is that the setting isn't California. Something, Zorro, and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop. First off, it's a Republic serial in 12 chapters.",1
This was one of the best of the era.,1
"It gets 8 out of 10 because it still suffers from slow pace, padding and the other tricks. I also like the way he dispenses with Sebastian in the first episode.",1
Dee Dee Ramone 1952 - 2002!,1
Its super and highly recommended.,1

"That's too bad - - it deserves better. Will he? Reeve is, surprisingly, very good. It's so good Sidney says he would kill for it. However, her accent did get on my nerves.",1
I had my moment of glory.,1
You Go Girl! < br / > < br / > What I viewed was incredible!,1
Everybody has his or her own agenda.,1
Worth watching.,1
As for Michael Caine he's..... well he's Michael Caine. Deathtrap is not a whodunit.,1
This is not helped by the acting. It's lucky then that the story is good ; and it is just about good enough to save the film. The casting of Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it.,1
Enter young wonder kid ( a solid Reeve ) who's just written such a play.,1
"and Dyan Cannon screaming at regular intervals. 66 : 1 ratio. of films I don't think anyone wants to see in this compromised format. Minor complaints, both. They're definitely not bookish men who can't fight or will back down from an obstacle.",1
Gabba - gabba hey!,1
"TV reviewers poke fun at Caine, and he gets drunk. And, the much ballyhooed love scene is shockingly tepid.",1
"I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of'Death Trap "" in a top 5 list of the best stage - to - movie adaptations ever. You don't have to choose! Yes, the two stories have a lot in common.",1
"< br / > < br / > Sidney Lumet's comedy - thriller DEATHTRAP, as derived from Ira Levin's hit Broadway play, is a great example.",1
"The dialog is quick, fresh, and witty. How about Dyan Cannon?",1
"Caine, Cannon, and Fred Jones are superb. He cannot permit Reeve's scandalous play - a - clef to be produced. FULL OF SPOILERS. would be a splendid set of digs anywhere. So - - what else?",1
Awesome movie!,1
"Stage adaptations often have a major fault. 4 out of 10 Still, it's nice to look at for what it is. The script is incredibly convoluted, and keeps you guessing. "" The dynamics of their relationship are surprising.",1
"No surprises here - he does his usual good work. It's an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit. Or so you think, for the first half of the movie.",1
]. real life! ( Although marketeers decided to go with a more fun Rubik's Cube icon for the movie. ),1
"The rest is history. I have to check out some of their albums! "" ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the Ramones.",1
Let's just say that what we know in the beginning is all you have to know about the film for the present. < br / > < br / > Summing up : Well worth seeing - - but not everyone is pleased with the ending. MICHAEL CAINE is an insanely jealous playwright whose latest play has failed miserably.,1
Cannon's franticness works well for Myra. < br / > < br / > The acting is excellent.,1
"He was glib, deliciously manipulative and sadistic. Needless to say, it's a must - see. It was one of the finest DVD purchases I could've picked up. < br / > < br / > I absolutely relished Michael Caine's performance.",1
"It is called "" Deathtrap, "" and Sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit. Much of this is due to the cast, which is remarkably fine.",1
But film floats because of the actors and the script. The possible weakness here is Thompson's laid - back direction.,1
I don't think so.,1

He was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon. This is not a sci - fi nor action film of any sort. I mean really win me over.,1

!,1
It took me time to really appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. This movie is meant to be scary and I think it succeeds very well. It's about the worst night in Laurie Strode's short life. It's not about blood and gore. Need I say more? Very highly recommended!,1
It is one of the eeriest images in movie history. It is just pure terror.,1
Predictable horror movies bore me. : ),1
It is a MUST for all genre fans!,1
Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time. Without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. She gives a tremendous performance. Death at any turn. Halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way.,1
It works on many levels and draws audience in and never lets up. < br / > < br / > Halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie. It's reputation truly proceeded it.,1
"no.. maybe not to everyone, but to me it is and always will be. The film is sheer genius and will always hold a very special place in my heart.",1

"This movie is SOOOO funny!!! If you like monty python, You will love this film.",1

"My personal favorite horror film. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence. No bells or whistles, just the basics.",1
Get that! A true classic.,1
"The scariest night of the year! ! Besides the setting, there is some great acting.",1
But they don't. He showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. No movie.,1
"This is a very high - energy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kid's wet dream. Fun stuff indeed. And no, the film doesn't feel dated one bit, and yes, it was worth the wait. )",1
"Surprisingly, the animation manages to keep the feeling of the original art. < br / > < br / > Definite recommended!",1
a must watch movie.,1
< br / > < br / > I neglect describing plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it. Watching Fire and Ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year.,1
The rotoscoping is a lot more detailed and the animation has a vibrant look to it. It's still hella cool and really funny. With Ralph Bakshi most of his films appear to be like two - edged swords.,1
"This is another fantasy favorite from Ralph Bakshi ; after watching it on YouTube that is. With plenty of fantasy, sexual innuendo, and thrilling adventure.",1
Good story and excellent animation.,1
Fire And Ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world.,1
"I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea. < br / > < br / > Take none of it seriously. Just go in and have a good time. It's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers. How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones?",1
I for sure did not mind! It's quite effective. < br / > < br / > I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10. But I had also enjoyed this animation as a child and I never forgot it.,1
Enjoy! The art is good and you see glimpses of Frazetta at his best. Therefore the 2005 release was a dream come true for me.,1
"Anyone looking for "" depth "" would be sorely disappointed. I won't claim to be a fan of Ralph Bakshi, because i am not. yes i did.",1
This is not similar to Bakshi's usual frenetic style.,1

"The film is very complex, but not confusing.",1
What is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream?,1
Regardless of what you have heard about it.,1
I think it's necessary. And Tom Cruise does a very good job in it. < br / > < br / > This is a good movie.,1
"I really enjoyed this film because I have a tremendous interest in American History... the Antebellum years and the Civil War in particular. the movie makes no real mention of this, except to mention Henry A.

"She's impressionable and often von Niemann just humors her and constant fictional illnesses she feels plagued with. I'm certain the film's print has seen better days, though. This is the kind of B - horror item you'd find packaged in with 50 other random cheesefests and poverty row programmers. Lionel Belmore returns as yet another frightened, superstitious Bürgermeister. < br / > < br / > Creaky, static, but rather entertaining nonetheless thanks to the cast.",1

"Suitable for all ages, kiddies will no doubt love funny visuals.",1
"It begs for longer sequences, and begs more for even longer explanations. I have never been a fan of Mol, but I cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes. I am not going to lie. It does not feel rushed ; it just does not feel all there. On one hand, the film never overstays its welcome. But it curses the film as well, because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on.",1
Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers. Greetings again from the darkness. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page.,1
Great acting on the part of Gretchen Mol.,1
"Especially when that person eventually succumbed to a split personality disorder in her latter years as if to demonstrate her own point. But the delicate hand of the director is more palpably felt during Page's times of despair. If you're director Mary Harron, you don't shy away from showing the push / pull nature of THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE.",1
"< br / > < br / > What I will ramble on about for a moment is the splendid performance of Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page. Mol perfectly captures the essence of the woman as I have come to conceive her, no pun intended, ). It is a bravura "" comeback "" from an undeserved semi - obscurity.",1
"< br / > < br / > Very soon, we go into flashback.",1
Page comes across as someone who enjoys her work and doesn't appear to be degraded by it. It also appeared to be much less harsh. < br / > < br / > There are many things I did not know about Page.,1
"This does not mean, however, that it is a bad movie. < br / > < br / > Everyone knows Bettie Page ( played by Mol ).",1
It was later said that she had been over hyped. Was it Mol or Theron? I disagree. Oh yeah!,1
The film captured this quite nicely. Bettie Page is simply being who she is. No harm there.,1
"Much like her photos, it's just an image. The film errs with the character of John Willie, played by Jared Harris. It does tend to exaggerate Bettie's notoriety.",1
Some great costumes too.,1
What Page didn't realize is that in fact she would be just that when she arrived.,1
Ms. Harron has crafted a work of subtle subversion. Page herself.,1
"she comments a couple of times ). The movie, co - written and directed by American Psycho's Mary Harron, fleshes out the key parts of her life well enough. Soon, she becomes the underground pin - up sensation, with bondage the obvious ( and "" notorious "" of the title ) trait attributed to her. This adds a much needed comic relief to the film's otherwise usual nature. She's not a simplistic character, even if at times her ideas of morality are questionable ( "" well, Adam and Eve were naked, weren't they? """,1
Gretchen Mol looks just like Bettie Page and gives a very fine performance. S Senate investigation in the 1950s. I looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from film since its original showing at the Toronto Film Festival.,1
I would rate it a 7. It's shot in black and white for that 1950's nostalgia feel. Terrific casting. And her body is as close to a replica of Page's as possible. Mol herself with the Bettie Page black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page.,1
"7 / 10 The problem is, it's emotionally rather flat.",1
"You were one helluva woman. If this doesn't put her back on the A - list, well I'll be a monkey's uncle. < br / > < br / > Intensely private, Bettie herself has not seen film yet.",1
"To watch Ms. Mol as Ms. 50'Miami comes alive in super - saturated, 16mm - style color. The real Bettie Page seems to scamper, smile and pose before us, and yet the effect is curiously lightweight, barely lewd and not at all dangerous.",1
I still enjoyed as much as I did the original though. < br / > < br / > Overall 8 - 9 / 10 While NightWing ( Dick Grayson ) comes to the rescue often.,1
"Slowly, everyone grows up and goes away. It doesn't pander for tears or ask for sympathy.",1

I just wish some of episodes could be longer. It was an interesting perspective to their relationship.,1
But this gal truly can act. Glad indeed. Check it out! Nothing period. It makes one think.,1

"< br / > < br / > A very good movie - - essential viewing if you came of age in 1980. Madge ( Marilyn Kagan ) has overprotective parents. I give it 8.

I give it a strong 8 / 10.,1
"Yeah, I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy / Drama under Genre. < Nevertheless, the denouement is great. 5 ; I gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars. That sure is misleading, isn't it?",1

"there's an episode on their love lives, jobs etc. The third follows their European tour.",1
So why not a 10?,1
0 and DD5. Ferrari's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing. Otherwise we get the film in its original 1. < br / > < br / > As for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them. < br / > < br / > The same is also true of the soundtrack.,1
"Broken is no genre classic. Here's to knowing he's getting the chance. No, not really. Mayhem ensues.",1
"There is no way out. The film is sharp and cool, it looks good and it feels like something big. They are all guns and knives.",1
0 and DD5. Ferrari's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing. < br / > < br / > As for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them. < br / > < br / > The same is also true of the soundtrack.,1
We're going to be drowning in crap! I've seen the box office. You're staying away in droves.,1
go!,1
< br / > < br / > This movie must be seen.,1
Please purchase this game as soon as possible. PURE GENIUS!!,1
"You also get to play as Chris Redfield, from Resident Evil 1. I give it a 10 out of 10.",1
"The third, and final installment of "" Hanzo the Razor "" is the most concrete of them all. Definitely the perfect finale. The "" training "" even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film.",1
WHO'S GOT THE GOLD?,1
"The film opens with Hanzos assistants scared by a ghost, and typically he decides straight away that he needs to have carnal knowledge of this ghost. Though neatly laden throughout with nice moments, a fair amount of action and a little sleaze, the film does lose a little from a relatively restrained approach.",1
"I need to be honest. Specially Paco character. Yeah, there is a lot of humor for all tastes.",1
< br / > < br / > 6.,1
"If that is not a promising beginning for an awesome film experience, I don't know what is. Following the brilliant "" Goyôkiba "" ( aka. """,1
Eric Phillips ( Don Wilson ) is an undercover cop in the near future. Why the Academy failed to take notice is beyond me.,1
"And so on, and so on. If I have a guess as to what it all adds up to, it would be a sly satire of the whole nature of artistic interpretation.",1
An amazing film. At least for me.,1
"< br / > < br / > And I will stick my neck out to say that this movie is to basketball just as how Goal was to football. This project was originally conceived as the movie version of popular Japanese manga SlamDunk! It made the sport look good because of its charismatic characters, despite them dripping so much coolness and aloofness on the courts.",1
"General success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same nefarious villain of before. You've seen it all before, but it's the kind of stuff it never hurts to see again when it's done well. I expect he had good'assistants') - the script delivers and the presentation is slick and stylish.",1
Very good!,1
< br / > < br / > A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court. Recommended. It's quite entertaining even with a scatter - shot ending.,1
"With that established, let us further into the movie. Go ahead and watch it. < br / > < br / > 9 / 10 for you cast of Kung Fu Dunk.",1
A love interest. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. Absolutely. Come on. Really?,1
But it is a little inconsistent! And would be devastating! Explaining just enough to stay excited! What happened to them? Like Rose and her husband! It even saves some episodes from getting boring! Good or bad! Of course this show has some flaws! You will grow to love these characters! Maybe they will return in later episodes!,1
Lost holds something interesting for everyone. The difference between season 2 and 3 however was huge. The nice thing about this series is that its totally new. They got that in season 3 and brings us a promising series future for season 4. The result of that is that its a series which does not let you go.,1
"Lost "" is pure genius.",1
It is genius.,1
"The Mad Magician "" of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor. Another must - see for my fellow Price fans.",1
I am totally and completely hooked. Lost is spellbinding!! !,1
"The plot got old after the first couple episodes... and MOST OF ALL.... I absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. Now, the 4th season. Also, some of my favorite characters have left.",1
"They pray for rescue. < br / > < br / > A group of over forty passengers struggle to cope after their plane crash - landed into a deserted island. This gives us more insight and, hence more suspense and excitement as the events unfold in the present. They discover a mysterious man who has a job to do.",1
( i have a review on that too that you could check it out. ),1
?,1
All in all its great show but not perfect. Annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing. Some characters are very two dimensional.,1
An absolutely brilliant show.,1
I think... ) with good and bad sides. !,1
"The narrative flows naturally, the dialogue is witty, the characters are memorable and the execution is superb. Just be sure you start at the beginning.",1
But I was seriously amazed.,1
I enjoy watching TV again. I am obsessed!,1
!,1
"Wow was I surprised. Can you say gravity well, damn I got sucked in.",1
Epic. < br / > < br / > See this show.,1
!,1
How did the island disappear? What's the fog? I have confidence in the writers. Who is Richard Alpert?,1
"There's hope somewhere. < br / > < br / > Lost beat's all other show's by a landslide. Lost, probably the best t. v series ever made. Every thing happens for a reason. "" Your heart beating. And that is truly shown in the series. And if your hating or criticising Lost you don't know how to watch t. v or watch drama. But it does!",1
"The show, that is. If you're a DOG you will have your own storyline. Where did they come from?",1
couldn't be better at giving the film an atmosphere of shabby decadence.,1
Highly recommended.,1
This is definitely a role he was born to play. Why this hasn't had a Video or DVD release yet?,1
movies.,1
< br / > < br / > Long live King!,1
It's much more enjoyable on big screen than on TV.,1
You can feel Larry's pain after It's wonderful and really heartfelt and real. I would say watch this movie if you ever get the chance.,1
"Michael Caine is superb as the sympathetic bartender. The performances are excellent throughout, and the movie was very well cast. I'm just glad that I hadn't read any reviews of "" Mr. Destiny "" before seeing it. Wonderful choice of music, too.",1
! Very Very underrated movie here folks. This is Belushi's pinnacle movie in my opinion.,1
"If you were on it, you were "" all that. "" Then, he gets a chance to find out.... and gets a little more than he bargained for. That was in 1987. !",1
Then one night his car breaks down again.,1
Nothing really inventive or new. Watch it. It's not a big film.,1
"Mr. Destiny - 3. In fact, Larry even makes a comment about never seeing the bar before. He hates his life. Would have been.",1
Michael Caine is perfect as the bartender.,1
Spoiler!!! I give it a 7 out of 10.,1
"Nevertheless, a nice way to spend two hours.",1
"Belushi is having a rotten 35th birthday. So check this out for a fun exploration of "" what if? "" He heads into an empty bar to call for a tow.",1
"The storyline is basic, but hey whats there to tell a story about?",1
"Great cast, great film.",1
It has nothing to do with Koteas'acting ability.,1
The story - amazing.,1
Let's get it out! This is a great film and unjustly buried film.,1
At least a Dozen. < br / > < br / > I have seen this movie many times. If anyone out there remembers this film the same as I do?,1
"Have just finished watching this film, which upset me greatly.",1
"That was one of the reasons why "" Beat Street "" was better. And I loved all of them.",1
"This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. Do not look for humor in this film, there is none.",1
"With the right exposure in right circles, the film could develop quite a cult following, along with the original "" Scanners "". < br / > < br / > The film had a positive message, and was fun to watch. so much fun to watch!",1
Guess which one wins. His eyes are ruined pits.,1
"Strange comics. Well, wouldn't you know it? I did.",1
( And is absolutely adorable. ) A good way to spend an evening.,1
It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s.,1
"I really enjoyed "" Doctor Mordrid "". Plus, the settings were wonderful. It was definitely money well - spent )! Basically, this a film that's just plain fun to watch.",1
I give it a 20 out of 10. Worth seeing!,1
Wow! The story turns and twists and the audience can never predict what will happen next. The Asian cast was also superb. I have to admit that Holly was not on my watch list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. Speaking about an emotional roller coaster.,1
"While on a journey, his motorbike runs out of fuel, and he is forced to rent a room at a brothel. A mine is set off by a cow and the truck driver believes she is dead, so Holly is then left on her own. Holly and Patrick begin a friendship of trust and understanding. Holly then shows her willingness to leave this lifestyle but her confusion on what is right and wrong. """,1
"What a powerful and moving story! When Holly is sold again, Patrick desperately searches for her.",1
I won't explain it here - go see the movie.,1
The film is beautifully shot. Brilliant!,1
Everyone should go see this film. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance.,1
"From purely an artistic and cinematic perspective, it is amazing. I have to say that Holly blew Trade out of the water. I can honestly say that I have never seen audiences more moved.",1
"All I can say is "" Wow "".",1
!,1
Kudos to those who managed to get it made.,1
I found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause.,1
I hope that this kind of ending rings true in actually for many. I love reading INTELLIGENT and INSIGHTFUL commentary. The writers on THIS show were fantastic and the Actors were beyond TALENTED. I LOVED GOOD TIMES with the rest of many of you.,1
Reading all of the comments Are very exciting. I would like to have some of his work displayed my home.,1
"Michael, the baby son is a freedom walker and JJ is a clown. My heart was sad when I learned that Ester Rolle had passed.",1
'from Diff'rent Strokes.,1
I was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended.,1
Black America was a different group of people in the seventies.,1
"So does a lot of the acting. But I < br / > < br / > don't care. Great music, great < br / > < br / > dancing!",1
His emotional age is about 11 or 12 even though he looks like a guy in his early twenties.,1
The answer is this. Pearl's gossipy friend was Vilma.,1
"( Mike Evans passed away Dec. 2006 ). First, I'll give my rating for the series overall ; * * * * * * * 7 out of ten stars. Created by Norman Lear as a spin - off of "" Maude "", he once again struck the right chord with viewers.",1
"Also, I really love the theme song.",1
! Especially without the original cast.,1
But they don't dwell on it. We all loved JJ's dynamite and his antics.,1
"Last three seasons : C +. They had three kids : J. J., Thelma, and Michael. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show.",1
"I need not have worried, I was left breathless by this movie.",1
But this is a great martial arts film. The humour in this is also of best. - during fights.,1
A must see for hip - hop lovers.,1
this was one of those $.,1
"The great colours and the sets get me going too. This is a great sci - fi experience! That just tells you that the budgets were a bit lower back then, doesn't it? By the way, I notice that the astronauts'uniforms in Forbidden Planet were also used for "" Queen of Outer Space ""! < br / > < br / > The special effects are fantastic, and storyline is not too far - fetched.",1
"But the only one left is Dr. Morbis ( Walter Pidgeon ) and his daughter, who somehow were immune to an attack that left everyone else dead. A ship of astronauts are on a mission to the planet Altair - 4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before.",1
"That love triangle thing... yuk! Robbie driving the car over the desert in the far distance is a hoot though! Forbidden Planet is a bit of both, but in that rarity for the genre, colour.",1
"But then we get to the actors, darn it. Without a doubt. Ambitious? 'Forbidden Planet'is wonderful to look at.",1
"It can be watched again and again with pleasure - - I have been doing so for nearly fifty years. There are so many visual splendors in this one, it's hard to choose a favorite from the film's scenes. As did others in this forum, when "" Fobidden Planet "" was offered in 1956, I rushed to see it. Veteran Cyril Hume's literate script was filmed intelligently by long - time director Fred McLeod Wilcox with clarity and imagination. Still the best, many say.",1
Ariel is a spirit.,1
Being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment. It's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film.,1
"Even more famous was the appearance of Robby The Robot, in his first role in either film or television.",1
And don't get me started about the poster.,1
"If planning a remake, SKG or Lucas, Watch Out! It did. Level One, Horror.",1
"Even today, they still hold plausibility. ( What did the Krell creatures look like? )",1
A lot of them were crappy even back then.,1
< br / > < br / > The scenes with the tiger show their age now. Nearly 80 now! Timeless. He was 30 when this film came out!,1
The machinery they left behind is still functioning. He got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the Robot from Lost In Space.,1
eg.,1
"A housewife's dream! "" The most interesting character is Morbius'daughter Altaira. The interior of the saucer is just this side of Buck Rogers. There's a lot visually to like.",1
This was the first movie where you COULDN'T. It's definitely not'Wagontrain to the Stars '.,1
So I had views from all kinds of directions. ( bafta = good luck Romanian ). There were no consequences.,1
The only thing I knew about this film prior to seeing it was Robby The Robot. My preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci - fi flicks that the 1950's was noted for. How wrong I was.,1
"< br / > < br / > On the surface, this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery. < br / > < br / > Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful.",1
< br / > < br / > The special effects are also quite arresting.,1
"< br / > < br / > In other words, it predict our inevitable destiny.",1
< br / > < br / > Honorable mention for haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles. < br / > < br / > The Krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me.,1
"[ It's not what you know, but how you use what you know! ] Advanced technology and responsibility seem go hand in hand. I first saw this movie when it originally came out. Evil. I was about 9 yrs.",1
"The Krell, a much superior species, could not stop it ; it destroyed them. They are always trying to figure out "" dames. "" The cook is a great character, with his obsession for hooch. Forbidden Planet, one of the earliest of the genre, is still one of the very best. The landing party has never been of great interest to me. It is released in sleep, a bad dream come to corporeal existence. The rest of the actors are pretty interchangeable.",1
But it just isn't entertaining. THE JIST : See something else.,1
But it just isn't entertaining. THE JIST : See something else.,1
And that's the problem with this film.,1
: - ) the end. The director? very good movie.,1
! A must see for all fans of great noir film.,1
"Noir, if anything, is about moods and attitudes. Why?",1
Ever read Jim Thompson?,1
15 year old teens may appreciate it though.,1
"He looks dumb, but he isn't.",1
< br / > < br / > I LOVED the music it's just great.,1
QOTSA! Superb use of music.,1
"Those of you who know the group dEUS, know the lead singer Tom Barman. < br / > < br / > In short, see it, it is definitely worth it!",1
"I mean, in every shot you feel the love that Tom Barman has for Antwerp and urban lifestyle. One thing many people tend to criticize is the "" lack "" of story. I think "" Anyway... "" is a kick - ass movie. And that's strong : just being able to appreciate all of that, that universe, that's art. Really.",1
"to see or not to see, that's the?",1
This movie blows you off your feet.,1
"Still, I really enjoyed this movie. Who the hell is that Windman anyway? In that light some might be disappointed.",1
"Just as simple as that, and he succeeded. in a beautiful, smooth way. He knows people..... and Antwerp.",1
"< br / > < br / > And ""sst, mondje dicht hé. "" They complain that this movie has no story, etc. and tragic ( Windman, Paul Garcin,... ) characters.",1
< br / > < br / > The screenplay is great stuff. Cheers. Camera angles and colors are very well chosen. The'costumes'are very hot and very'seventies'too. And I loved ( most of the ) acting.,1
"It's an unforgettable movie. Also, the title tune is a beauty.",1
"Well, a lot of things.",1
"Like other films of the period, homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms.",1
"< br / > < br / > The movie focuses mostly on relation between Kiki and Alex. But, after I watch it, I didn't get this feeling of "" sickness "" which I would surely have regarding society rules. You feel the connection. And no moment I though this is immoral. You don't have total story, but only fragments. It's a strange, yet somehow impressive story, about love.",1
Yipee! What a stunning movie! Where's his Oscar?,1
Malone is the only actress I've ever seen in movies who enters a room eyes first. No one is very happy & no one is happy for very long. Her performace is of one note.,1
"They are too straight, too virtuous. Then there was silence.",1
She marries Stack.,1
"* * * 1 / 2. < br / > < br / > Kyle Hadley has it all. After a whirlwind romance, he marries her and brings her home. Kyle sleeps with a gun under his pillow. Wealth, a plane, you name it. Her Oscar was well deserved. Written on Wind is no exception. Mitch is not from a wealthy home.",1
Douglas Sirk directs this over - acted drama about the unhappy affluent. I was most impressed with Malone.,1
They play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding. < br / > < br / > Well worth watching with some interesting performances from entire cast.,1
"You will be entertained! Its a crime that he did not. One - dimensional, 100 - percent soaper.",1
"And of course, it's all captured in vibrant Technicolor.",1
Lauren Bacall was living through husband Humprey Bogarts illness & death when she did this film. Robert Stack is nominated & falls just short for his role. Rock Hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom.,1
"For me this is not enough. Why? Written on the Wind "" is a Douglas Sirk's melodrama. < br / > < br / > The plot has very interesting ingredients.",1
( It's been rumored that the story was based on Libby Holmann's marriage into Reynolds tobacco money. ) Nobody ever did it better.,1
They get married and travel to Acapulco and the insecure Kyle stops drinking.,1
Fabulous film! !,1
"Written on the Wind "" was an enormously successful Universal picture. Most of the decor is phony.",1
It's well worth it.,1
"An ancient morality tale. Was Loren's part considered a leading role? I think Robert Stack's might have been a Masseratti. But seriously, what were those sports cars?",1
Don't miss!,1
"Nobody can say that the Hadley are real people. One ends up giving up. You just see reflections. Sirk never tried to show reality, on the contrary.",1
"A bit shabby housing project style is how I'd describe it, and this is how many people live on the outskirts of larger cities. I saw this film at the Chicago Reeling film festival.",1
"Stack plays the deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil tycoon. I doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was. Mitch wants nothing to do with her. Sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players. They both love the same woman, Lucy, ( Lauren Bacall ), who becomes Kyle's wife.",1
"The 1956 potboiler, adapted from Robert Wilder's novel, was a veritable three - ring - circus showcasing alcoholism, greed, impotence and nymphomania.",1
rather unsatisfying really.,1
A young girl surviving as a prostitute.,1
It spoke to me. We were there!,1
The only problem about this film is I get bad DVD. So I decided to see One take only and I didn't disappointed again.,1
The only thing I am not sure about is the title. I recommend this movie! I like that. I have been there.,1
Paradise did not come easy.,1
I don't think I'll ever forget it. !,1
Not many false notes in this one.,1
< br / > < br / > Ashley Judd is really quite amazing in this movie.,1
I could have kept watching for hours. This film is easily my top ten favorites of all time. She is so perfect in this movie. I think the title especially put me off.,1
This will be a different kind of review.,1
For any woman NOTE : This isn't an action movie! !,1
I cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is.,1
"Boy, talk about failing to fulfill your early promise! This is not an action film, nor is it really a romance.",1
My vote is ten. The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic.,1
One thing you can't say about this film is that it is dull. They are both terrific 1950s horror films.,1
n i have just finished watching this film in my GCSE history class.,1
I wish he was my own brother. What a thrilling situation. I have to watch it at least once a week.,1
That is the hallmark of a great film. Unless you happen to support apartheid. Of course he has achieved it. I couldn't.,1
""" Cry Freedom "" is not just a movie.",1
"What is "" Cry Freedom "" like? But sometimes sacrifices must be made ( Biko's death ) so truth could be reveled ( Woods book ).",1
"* * * of 4 stars. In that case, Biko dies in vain.",1
"It could not be. A remake is necessary. His life and his teaching is reduced to little, at best a few witty remarks.",1
"Biko : I advocate a confrontation. I cannot imagine a better choice for the role. Biko : Not necessarily. The I didn't know of any other work of his till i recently came across'Cry Freedom ', released back in 1987.",1
The opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot. What a brilliant film. But neither of these pointers are flaws in any way.,1
< br / > < br / > I think it served it's purpose in my case. Little did we know what we were about to experience.,1
But through the efforts of Woods the truth comes out. Plus he's constantly spied by the police. The authorities try to hush up the matter because Biko has become a huge personality in South Africa. It has in fact two narratives : first it narrates the life and death of Biko. Kevin Kline gives a great performance in this second half too. What a movie!,1
"Then we are introduced to Donald Woods ( Kevin Kline ), who is the editor of a popular newspaper. The films uses Wood's two books for it's information and basis - "" Biko "" and "" Asking for Trouble "". So "" The True Story Of The Friendship That Shook South Africa And Awakened The World. "" < br / > < br / > The film takes place in the late 1970's, in South Africa. Soon, Steve Biko is arrested and is killed in prison.",1
8 out of 10.,1
Viewing Cry Freedom in this light is deeply ironic - - - actually tragic. Woods achieved little.,1
7 / 10.,1
"Now twelve years after movie's production, CRY FREEDOM is in many ways a more interesting film to watch. And yes I did miss another international South African drama, MANDELA and DEKLERK. Though this ( also highly recommended ).",1
SPOILER!!,1
"Eventually Hagen is dead, and so is Kriemhild.",1
This film remains earthbound. Pristine full - length print. And battles. Ideal.,1
He is much more formidable.,1
"In both pictures, there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters. Please see also my comment on Die Nibelungen part 1 : Siegfried. Now, with this focus on mass action, Lang is presented with greater challenges in staging.",1
: ) subtitles ( what do you call that in silent films? ) It was difficult to read the?,1

It is a vicious cycle. See?,1

< br / > < br / > Weird but also very amazing and watchable. He goes to a bawdy club while his wife supposedly waits at home.,1
"For that reason he must not remain forgotten. Mr. Beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife. This isn't just a fun movie, or a well - made movie. The two make up and go out to the movies.",1
She is the only one who understands him.,1
Starewicz would also make Frogland ( 1922 ) and The Mascot ( 1933 ) but his first notable work would be this one.,1
"Action happens with intricate detail, but rapidity and a quicker pace of filming is lost in the process. Despite its pace, the film is an excellent example of Starewicz's early puppetry and is highly recommended. Starewicz's twist on the story is to use embalmed beetles with wires straightening the legs in frame - by - frame animation.",1
This is certainly among her better films.,1
Well said! Needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning.,1
"The themes would have rung true and deep at the time. NY Times 1922. This is not a'Christiany'film, it is not selling anything.",1
characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past.,1
The very final scene is also pretty cute. A rich old crank builds a mansion at the top of a hill next to the river. < br / > < br / > The film excels in some ways.,1
Love this movie!,1
Very few are hypnotic to me. You would have to see her again and again. I've seen thousands of movies. I had no idea what I was in for.,1
"The atmospherics are first - rate, with the outdoor fishing village sets being particularly well - conceived. He mimes it < br / > < br / > This was actually the second time Pickford filmed TESS. The end result certainly lived up to her expectations. < br / > < br / > Mary Pickford is utterly charming in this splendid, heart - wrenching film. Both films were very popular at box office.",1
She does so with spunk not seen in many heroines of the time. Pickford's close ups are wonderful. Recommended. She is even willing to take a bath.,1
< br / > < br > Casting is great! !,1
What's new? She is likely to be noticed for this role. He also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich families.,1
This film was great.,1
There were a few flaws visible. That scene looks very unprofessional. Omigosh! That may spoil your mood. The theme and the screenplay was fantastic. Madhur Bhandarkar has given it all raw.,1
For such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long?? For how long? Andie MacDowell's facial expressions are great again in this movie.,1
Please don't afford to miss it. Even she is fired from the job. I would recommend all to see the movie.,1
It leaves a lasting impression in the end.,1
Terrific film with excellent character development!,1
"She is shown as this celebrity maker, very popular at the social gatherings. This is what saves film for me. < br / > < br / > Celebrities party endlessly, they like to be seen at these parties, and to get due exposure in the media.",1
"Atul Kulkarni ' The film's writing is quite good. Otherwise the soundtrack is bad. They are attention seeking, salacious and hypocrite.",1
"The movie shows it boldly, no holds barred. Seems real.",1
The Write Word < br / > < br / > What you see is what you get. Not really! Bhandarkar cleverly avoids that.,1
For some reason - - oh it is explained! This film is fun.,1
DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SERIES! !,1
"The nightmare scenes are all great. It doesn't have the same atmosphere than the previous films. For me, Freddy is the boogeyman!",1
Not much to see here. ( 7 / 10 ) < br / > < br / > 5. A Nightmare on Elm Street. Next on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare.,1
i love 3d movies.,1

Can the kids finally stop Freddy for good? to find out you'll have to watch Freddy's Dead.,1

"They watched and found anecdotal and thematic interest there. Like many people here, I started out finding my patience being tried by this film. Think about it for a minute or two. It's the inflation problem of modern movies. But that isn't quite accurate. By the end, I actually shed a few tears.",1
Max Steiner's score is unforgettable.,1
Thats enough money for both him and Kaite to travel to America.,1
"However, it's obvious that these people feel no affection for the man, and are simple showing him attention to exploit him for money. As Gypo drowns his sorrows in copious volumes of alcohol, trapped in a vicious little circle of depression, his extravagant spending captures the attention of the investigating IRA members. Yet again, early morning television proves an invaluable resource for films that I otherwise would never have been able to track down.",1
< br / > < br / > Victor McLaglen portrays the fallen Gypo Nolan and definitely deserved the Best Actor Oscar he was awarded for this film.,1
"Anyway, the sudden turn at the end brought tears to my eyes. < br / > < br / > Ford, as usual, packs a lot into a little bit of film.",1

He hasn't the wit to really cover his own tracks. He also picks up a hanger - on played by J. M. Kerrigan. His real name before having it anglicized was Sean O'Fiernan. No split involved in his award.,1
It deserves a 12.,1
The lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death. This is one of Hollywood's Classic.,1
"10 / 10. I love the darker side of Ford. Gypo Nolan ( Victor McLaglen ) is as poor as anyone on Earth. Meanwhile, the other Irish rebels are searching for the informer. The acting is remarkable.",1
The new actor Aryan gave a good performance. It got me thinking. What a false world this is.,1
He has a family in India. Once by mistake he kills Shekhar ( Akshay Kumar ). Kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague.,1
It isn't for eyes of children. The songs are catchy.,1
It gives a powerful message of family.,1
This was a excellent movie.,1
Leia is still cool in this film as well as Han and Lando.,1

"< br / > < br / > Overall, not AS bad as many say it is. For diehard fans of the books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings. At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously!",1
I'm inclined to be in the middle. There seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net.,1
< br / > < br / > I have to confess to a certain bias here.,1
< br / > < br / > The voice acting was generally of high quality.,1
5 - The Last Battle. 9 out 10.,1
"Regardless, this is an epic and wonderfully animated film. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given. The film also boasts a grand music score by Leonard Rosenman that fits every scene.",1
"And those are stylish slow motion kills. The whole cast is too run of the mill. "" Take Aragorn for example. Yes a sword. < br / > < br / > And then there is Gandalf.",1
It captured my imagination.,1
"Speaking as a purist, this is a finer homage to Tolkien than the updated version. We see his decline as weight of his burden increases. Bakshi sustains Frodo's character as Tolkien conceived it.",1
Well guess what? This is a very beautiful film.,1
"This is not a garden variety Disney But there is some level of interest always with the characters, and here there's a more old - fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more. And with Bakshi's version, it's almost not fair in a way, as what we do see is really not the complete vision, not what Jackson really had ( probably final cut ).",1
If only John Hurt weren't too old to play Aragorn ; I love his voice.,1
but instead of destroying it he foolishly chooses to keep it.,1
The Emperor is somewhat an original character. A very good movie.,1
"Where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which Bakshi has created. He does not receive 1 / 100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience. Something so fresh, and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as "" The Lord of the Rings "". But I feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm. No it's not live action. No, this is not Disney animation. There are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3 / 4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film, but there are very few changes to the storyline.",1
"The dialouge is often laden, heavy handed and unconvincing. What shall it be? "". Undoubtedly it was Wells that planted the seed.",1
"Unlike Metropolis, however, it might not bear repeated viewings. Maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci - fi innovation : a sequel? Ultimately, the storyline covers 100 years. But that's a big problem with this film - - there really isn't a cohesive storyline. Things to Come is an historic film.",1
he sweeps his hand over the night sky. it was and remains far ahead of its time.,1
"This is an amazing movie from 1936. It could use closed - captioning. However, when it gets to the future, it's just plain fun to watch. I think I understood only 80 % of the dialog.",1
The special effects are very good as is the story line. This film was cutting edge for its day. This is a fascinating work on numerous levels. Thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow. SYNOPSIS The future as seen from 1939 England.,1

"I'm sure glad that war didn't turn out as it did in the movie. Ralph Richardson is very good as the "" The Boss "" a megalomaniac warlord.",1
In Wells's lifetime scientists certainly fled the rightwing fascistic governments of Hitler and Mussolini. Scientists as a group are far too above world of politics to engage in such things. < br / > < br / > Wells got it wrong both in time and in development.

< br / > < br / > That imagery is very effecting. Who? That audience and myself were effected by this film!,1
"All three times the sound and print quality stank - - particularly the sound. Aside from the great movie METROPOLIS, this is about the oldest pure sci - fi movie. How true! As the sound on the video kept cutting out, I really would have appreciated this! First, it is extremely original in both style and content.",1
Wells'prediction was borne out all too soon. ) I hope a good DVD exists of entire film. Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the Chief's mistress. The Everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design.,1
"The grander conceptions have something to them ; a war in 1940, well that was perhaps predictable... Lasting nearly 30 years, mind!? It's not a great role, yet Richardson makes a lot of it.",1
"However, much was right.",1

This makes for a much less textured film. Also the creatures were excessively muppet - like and cutesy. The It just feels like lazy construction.,1

"However, the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer.",1
"and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus. He's told to'take a vacation ', and that's the last thing on his mind.",1
"Make my day. "" Although some say that The Enforcer is the best out of the series, I completely disagree. ; in Magnum Force "" A man's got to know his limitations "" ; and in this it's "" Go ahead.",1
"The Enforcer "" should never have been made. Maybe he's been gone for too long this time.",1
"This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war.",1
Harry's always on the job it seems.,1
"harry carasso, Paris, France",1
He will be missed. What an actor.,1
!,1
"Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinée style. In fact, I think it is the third best film in the 6 - part saga. Also, it is a lot of fun. C3PO and R2D2 provide ( as usual ) great comic relief.",1
One of the smartest Greek series ever! We'll never forget Eglimata or any of casting crew!,1
! again!,1
Surely a serial you will never stop enjoying!,1
And we find the loving Fido whatever he may do.,1
"Highly recommended. Fido has structure, a script that tells a story, and acting that is superior.",1
"< br / > < br / > The story is set in a parallel - type world. For the life of me, why did this film receive an R rating?! Mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombie'friend.",1
The extras were cool too.,1
"At the end of the film, it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour. "" movie.",1
I was also on hand for the premiere in Toronto. The kids were also great.,1
"Fidois a very odd film. His mom is would - be social climber, and his dad is nervy and detached. < br / > < br / > The film looks gorgeous, and is wonderfully performed by all involved.",1
It deserved more recognition. Oh well.,1
).,1
A true reality show. What's not to like? Loved it! A nice touch.,1
"Timmy "" kills "" the zombified neighbor. Their son, Timmy, befriends the zombie, naming him "" Fido "".",1
"No? Well, actually, it kind of is. And I am so glad I did. It's a re - animated dead guy... a zombie.",1
It's amazing. Who would have thought?,1
My goodness. Billy Connelly flexes his acting muscle.,1
Harrison Ford is still good. He really brings the changes Luke has gone through seem real.,1
"I give it an 8. Even Connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job. Every single of the famous Lassie episodes are spun here. This film takes place in the 1950s. Timmy was named that for a reason! So, for some people, this will really work.",1
A satire to be precise. Why did the people love it? And this somebody is me.,1
"However, Fido itself is a very good movie. This is a clever premise.",1
"Go and see this movie! She's sweet, funny and sexy!",1
"It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual Bizarro Award. For me anyway, "" Fido "" is a hoot!",1
!,1
"But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian Director and it's a Comedy! I urge you to go see this little Canuck gem. And, YES, I actually think it is better than'Shawn of the Dead '. I'll certainly be buying the DVD once it emerges hopefully by next Summer.",1
"The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well - adjusted, useful members of the community. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. Now, given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, I realise this is a rather big claim. The charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect.",1
"Quite frankly, I'm just happy Fido got picked up for US distribution. In any case... < br / > < br / > Ever seen Shaun of the Dead? How about Lassie? Good. Unspeakable acts?",1
"< br / > < br / > I can't review "" Star Wars "" as a movie. A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..... He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be.",1

"Considering history, though, the film's impact was minimal at best. THEY mentality.",1
"If you are a real film buff, this is a film you will not want to miss.",1
"However, it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing. Talk about over - rated! Well made, but certainly NOT original!",1
"2! Well, you can't always trust the ratings.",1
"They are believable characters. What an amazing man! Harrison Ford - need I say more? and then watch the original trilogy yet again. They all do so well. The end could not be better. Yubb Nubb! ). The best climax is when Luke shouts "" NOOO! """,1
"This is an extraordinary film, that tricks you constantly.",1
He was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time. No one worked this formula like Haines.,1
"First off it's NOT a horror film. I'm giving it a 7. I disagree. On that level, it's pretty damn good.",1
If you want Scream or anything like the big - studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother. This well - written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say.,1
Two Thumbs Way Up! This movie is excellent. It's worth it.,1
Check this out.,1
Is it real?,1
If you want Scream or anything like the big - studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother. This well - written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say.,1
Only he can answer that question.,1
8 out of 10.,1
"I thought. WHAT?!!! "" I can tell this is going to be awesome! """,1
"I stress that these reports are uncomfirmed. However, as a monster character it never really comes to life.",1
"Not because that's what Wendigo actually is, but because that is how he understands it.",1
"He spies on George and Kim as they have sex. He follows the family to their vacation home, making sure they see him. In particular, deranged hunter Otis takes it personally. Miles takes figure home with him, already haunted by the death of the deer the day before.",1
This is also a story of alienation. < br / > < br / > The film is well paced and acted.,1
"Are there wendigos in the woods? Is Otis a psycho out to get our heroes? Much of the film, and maybe all of it, is not really about the titular creature. I usually prefer some ambiguity.",1
"But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films! < br / > < br / > - The Speeder Bike Chase : Alright, so this was a special effects moment.",1
The suspense was palpable throughout. No one could have done it better. His star just gets brighter brighter.,1
"To me, that always distracts. Even his singing was a delight. I am hoping A & E will continue this series.",1
It's not Shakespeare. ).,1
I hope so!,1
I have seen this movie quite a few times.,1
A classy film pulled in 2 directions.,1
"< br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) : "" Convite Para o Inferno "" ( "" Invitation to Hell "" ) My vote is seven.",1
Very curious why they were not even mentioned?,1
"Some of Busey's best work by far, rent or buy it today "" butthorn! "" I coughed up some of my egg nog laughing so hard.",1

"< br / > < br / > But does America deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys? Guns blasting, buildings exploding, cars crashing, and that's just the first ten minutes.",1
HoW????,1
He was a voyeur. Visually he did not remind me of Little Richard. Overall the movie was great.,1
Pierce Brosnan is outstanding in a very different role.,1
"He seemed tame, compared to what I remember of him at the time. Little Richard is always on Some of his energy, which he still has, does not come across full force. < br / > < br / > If they had gotten into "" Bronze Liberace "" as Richard use to refer to himself in interviews, then there's a story.",1
Thanks.,1
"All in all, its worth a gander.",1
An excellent movie.,1
"27 years later, it is still an original inspiration for achieveing my goals that I have set to accomplish since that time! I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it.",1
Bosley would be proud.,1
"The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better. < br / > < br / > The story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one.",1
"While Fred Schepisi's "" I. Q. """,1
( Two new entries for IMDb goofs section. ) This was a great romantic comedy! I give it an 8!,1
"It doesn't get any better than that. I'm a mess, a parody of myself "" he says.",1
"What a delightful romp a very competently made film that has so much charm and a feelgood factor that a lot of romantic comedies lack. How nice to know that it might work out I. 's innocent ( and disturbingly, exclusively Caucasian ) Eisenhower - era land of make - believe. Q.",1
I loved Walter Matthau as the one and only Albert Einstein.,1
They were connivers and gonifs. More like his Kotch than like Willie Clarke. Maybe nobody really has tried.,1
I also thought that Keene Curtis was wonderful as Eisenhower. Eight very solid points.,1
Hilarity ensues.,1
A genuine laugh - out - loud type film.,1
"If you ask me, James ( Stephen Fry ) really was a dull guy.",1
It also shows his range and depth as an actor. I really enjoyed them.,1
"You cannot go wrong with Meg Ryan's cute perkiness combined with Albert Einstein's genius. One of the best of the comedy romance genre. If you suspend all logic, you can almost imagine this silly story happening!",1
Bottom line - best romantic comedy ever. ).,1
I love sweet stories. People all ages should enjoy this movie. The cinematography is nice.,1
This is one of my all time favorites.,1
"Watch it and enjoy! hanging on the right from the chalk ledge. In the next camera shot, there only 2.",1
It's good'un! But I'm a big romantic and this movie * is * romantic.,1
I don't know. I was 6 years old.,1
"They're out for kicks and anti - capitalist, Euro - commie, slacker'freedom. Depardieu's most notorious film is this ( 1974 ) groundbreaker from Bertrand Blier.",1
"Add character actor, Philip Baker Hall as the hit - man's manager and we're off to the races. Dark comedy?",1
And that is part of their genius.,1
Most people I talk to have never heard of it. A very racy film for the early'70s.,1
like those of pulp fiction etc. Simply because they are different kinds of people.,1
).,1
"I can understand why many viewers, especially, the females would not like or even hate it. I am fascinated how Blier was able to get away with it. Their encounter with Jeanne Moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level.",1
And there are some great moments within this film. The enemy robot is very menacing.,1
"Yep, you read that right, kids. ), it's still a pretty damn cool little B - Movie.",1
That's why I bought the tape. < br / > < br / > Like I said - it's dumb.,1
Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnan's straight man. If you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself.,1
outstanding.,1
"I'm no expert and thus still trying to figure this out. < br / > < br / > Great flick but too short. But it's fun to dream about the potential there. For now, I live with the VHS incarnation.",1
"Judgment is victory for Robot Jox. OK, this movie was cool.",1
It's great view and very fun.,1
Big ones. It's really cool.,1
"This could be because this is the feature film debut for writer / director Richard Shephard, and he hasn't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet. At the end it feels a little too light, a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should. He always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale. Brosnan, looking aged and almost used up, sinks his teeth into the role of Julian in a way he never has before. """,1
"Yes, you heard me.",1
"Part of it was because the script was by Joe Haldeman. Nor was ancient Achilles a noble warrior. Still, it was fairly good, for a science fiction action movie.",1
"No - one else's opinion matters. It's by no means perfect, but it's entertaining and doesn't try to be anything other than that.",1
The film has crazy ideas.,1
< br / > < br / > Such is life.,1
"In his absence, her despair is great : she spends most days at the train station, waiting for him to return.",1
"To make ends meet, Maria starts working at a bar for mainly American soldiers and get to know a black soldier. Herman admits to the murder, ends up in jail and Maria vows to wait for him. There are food shortages. In her own words, she has become the "" Mata Hari of the economic miracle "". Right now, it's probably the correct way "".",1
But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it. Maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes Karl's mistress. But one day while getting intimate with Bill they see Hermann at the door.,1
Sensual and tough Maria Braun.,1
A realistic depiction of young love for the college set but also appealing to an older viewer like me. It has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two. Great movie.,1
lovetrapmovie. It is a rare morality play full of food for thought. < br / > < br / > Please visit www.,1
The ending is awesome because a storyline ( with a positive moral! ),1
"Get it? BROADside? No, not funny. We never missed it.",1
Check it out. I was pleasantly surprised. Good stuff!,1
"The story is poetic, substantive, and creative. Love trap is a "" must see "" independent film.",1
how i wish those days would come again. i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way!,1
I own it and enjoy it about once a year.,1
Brilliant.,1
There are so many other things to say about this incredible film.,1
I was not disappointed.,1
"Fortunately, the story of this book with moving pictures is good. Here, the obtrusively acted gypsy lurks around, seemingly, with a cloak of invisibility. Worse is the lack of editing ; there's very little scene dissection and scenes linger. '",1
"Classic movies like "" Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari. """,1
"By the way, look for William Powell as the Russian director.",1
Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent. William Powell is great as always.,1
"It was written by Lajos Biro, who had been on the scene long enough to know. Then, when Jannings arrives, everything settles down. 1927, and Hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade.",1
"Rating, 10. All around brilliance.",1
"We have nothing like that here, and this show suffers from it. South Park fans would surely get something here. Its not a little show.",1
It is also a political satire.,1
"Most films in the series take place over a few days or weeks. At the same time, he meets another boss ( Shushui ) - - a sort of guru to the poor. This is a minor mistake, and only a crazed fan like myself would have noticed.",1
This must be one of the best - sustained series in movie history.,1
This is definitely a film worth searching for.,1
Haven't seen this film? Haven't even heard of this film? It wouldn't surprise me.,1
Sad but poignant. I decided to wait until the next day.,1
This movie to me felt like closure.,1
!,1
"For all the Homicide junkies out there, this movie was great!",1
< br / > < br / > http : / / www. I think this film is incredibly underrated! Of course Greg Kinnear is always great. imdb.,1
'Is death justified by reasoning?'',1
This is a series I wish had lived on. My guess is Bayless of course.,1
I enjoyed this a lot.,1
This is a good film. Yes.,1
"It was too big to just cancel, but too small to get a case of'Rabid Ratings Ravings'over. But'G'isn't ready to really retire - retire yet. Alive, but in a comatose state, he is taken to the Hospital. There, I've said it Artistic, Artistic!! There is a great < br / > < br / > OUR STORY. In - Between "" of series.",1
And the movie certainly retained that spirit.,1
"Story - wise, I found this film somewhat lacking. ).",1
Davis is fine as Kinnear's flirtatious wife.,1
Jerry Lawler wins after a Fist Drop for the win. Was'nt really bad for Raw's first PPV of 006. Both men didn't really put a very good effort.,1
< br / > < br / > OK - its a Gundam series. Mobile suits based on angels - Check! But who cares?!,1
"< br / > < br / > And then there's the giant robot fighting. The relationship between Heero and Relena, and Milliardo and Noin are joys to watch.",1
Char isn't given this label. But on it's fourth re - use scenes like this do get old.,1
"Personally, I liked Heero because of his stoic personality.",1
Old conflicts will end and new ones will arise. The way its plot twists and turns has u riveted.,1
"Gundam Wing is an amazing show from start to finish, every single episode is a joy to watch. < br / > < br / > A perfect 10 / 10! The story though is set in an entirely different reality than any other Gundam show. This show is definitely one that shouldn't be missed.",1
the dubbing is simply flawless.,1
"Forget calling them real. Strangely, The Matador is a film about regret and loneliness. The story is a very simple thread. Its truly saying something.",1
Gundam Wing is a fun show. This does not happen in Wing.,1
"For one thing, the characters'personalities come across more "" directly "" than in the Japanese version. Kirby Morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as Trowa Barton. ( most of them are Caucasian in fact with a couple of non - Japanese Asians. )",1
I mean it can always be worse.,1
"< br / > < br / > But the magic of Gundam Wing is in the details, and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having. Emotion. Mobile Suit Gundam Wing is the Fourth series in the continuing Gundam chronicles.",1
Operation Meteor.,1
"This movie is very smart, abide rather short 76 minutes film.",1
"Worth a nice long look. That's not necessarily a bad thing, in this case.",1
Any more and it would have started to drag.,1
"I would recommend checking it out if you get a chance. It's not perfect, but it does what it's supposed to do.",1
"Great Brosnan in not equally great movie. Yesterday, I caught this movie again on TV so I looked at it a bit deeper.",1
"But it won't be an easy journey. ), the beginning scenes really drew me in. And Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation's got'em all.",1
It's fast paced and fun.,1
i wont ruin the ending. no it wasn't scary and wasn't meant to be. i totally disagree.,1
haunting shots of the arkansas swamp and scenery were neat. i don't think it's garbage. it was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary either.,1
"Strictly for the 8 - 12 y / o set, older kids will get bored think it lame.",1
I just watched it and watched it.,1
Look hard for it and you will be quite satisfied!,1
"Julian Noble ( Pierce Brosnan ) is a hit - man. < br / > < br / > Sounds like the set - up for a by - the - numbers comedy thriller, doesn't it? Instead, The Matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study. But it isn't. Or a "" facilitator of fatalities "", as he prefers to be called.",1
"Meanwhile, their biggest talent - Al Jolson - is noticeably absent. Even at a high salary he could not be compelled to join in. It is very hard to rate this film.",1
"Row after row of "" Doll "" characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor. It is all so demented. THE SHOW OF SHOWS is pretty gigantic.",1
"I'd rather have one of those cars, too. < br / > < br / > I think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the 80s. And now I understand why my mother felt the way she did in those closing moments.",1
"Nor can I think of one who's as successful. I can't think of any, at least not in Hollywood. Would I see it in a theater? Relax, it's a comedy.",1
The students can either buy or rent the movie.,1
"Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this odd couple. Philip Baker Hall puts an appearance as the liaison between Julian and his assignments. But did he really? < br / > < br / > Richard Shephard directs with style working with his own material. Someone knocks on his door, and knowing it's Julian, the paid assassin, he refuses to answer.",1
"< br / > < br / > I noticed one reviewer uses this in a Japanese class. Not all the stuff is factually spot on, but the tone is perfect. I saw this movie when it was new.",1
Then Hunt jumps on a chair. Sakamoto : Why not? Kazihiro jumps on the desk.,1
this is a great film!! ! Being from the 80's I loved seeing the ugly pacer again.,1
Teamwork was emphasized. He was a perfect fit for the movie. It's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all - out comedy farce. I saw this movie again as an assignment for my management class. I beg to differ.,1
"In Stevenson, we find an American working class figure of average intelligence with skills to chat people through misunderstandings. < br / > < br / > This includes Buster ( George Wendt ), Willie ( John Turturro ), and Paul ( Clint Howard, Ron's brother ). Remember sayings like'Union Yes!,'' the Japanese are taking this country over,'and'Americans are lazy?",1
The end was excellent.,1
"Sympathy for the devil, I guess. Did Julian's victims deserve to die? The Matador is a strange film.",1
The boy drops the bottle of milk. The cat drops the fish into the bowl. He (? ) It breaks. Both are innocent.,1
It's like an I. V. drip. Surprised to see the rather low score for this movie.,1
"Sherman, set the wayback machine for... 1986. But he has a fatal flaw common to many of us : he doesn't want to disappoint anyone.",1
"That's because it literally inspired obsession. Just like Tetris before it and more recently GTA III in 2002. bang! Whether directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but they still do.",1
"Basically, if you got 100 % of any of aforementioned, you get a bonus, helping you reach coveted high score placings. The graphics are, as I mentioned before, quite dated and very simple.",1
Enjoy.,1
But this film is not noir.,1
"Who's twisting who is the question. It's still a competent thriller, the machine carried on without him perfectly, but something was missing : Dix!",1
I can tell you just how bad this movie is.,1
"The "" little - people "" also play a big part in the movie, especially when they are drunk.",1
"I could watch this over and over, and I often do!",1
"The couple live in a posh apartment and run an auction business that deals with valuable collectibles. Yes, if only life could be this way! Russ and Valerie are having discussions about starting a family. This is a darling family film.",1
"This is also first time I had seen her cry. She replied, "" It means to be happy. """,1
"It almost feels like a new standard in screen acting. After an hour, the film just runs out of steam. Very amusing. Despite their completely different personalities and Julian's crude and insensible remarks, they become friends.",1
and the boy who played child. I thought the movie was actually pretty good.,1
"Like I said before, it's refreshing. I hope everyone gives it a shot.",1
It is truly enjoyable! Clean wonderful!,1
This is fun.,1
In a word : Showerman. I could probably storyboard Nemo from memory alone.,1
"I like Peter Sellers, most of the time.",1
).,1
Good film.,1
"< br / > < br / > It's a great film, and the best gag is very last line. < br / > < br / > Try it, you'll like it. It's set at the end of the "" swinging sixties "".",1
"Enjoy. Lupin sets off for Morocco, looking for a legendary treasure. < br / > < br / > Pretty much, this is a smooth ride with Lupin.",1
"Lupin's trying to get a huge treasure. Other then the bad dub, it isn't bad.",1
A simply wonderful little gem of a drama.,1
"< br / > < br / > It rates a 6. That is its strength, I think.",1
Then Pierce Brosnan called. Don't miss it.,1
"No Hollywood happiness here. If I'd changed the channel, I would have really missed a treasure.",1
"Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job as the angry Raymond. This is basically his story. The orgasm in ward is both sexy and amusing. This film is real, not glossy or flashy.",1
Not that it matters.,1
It WILL please you. It's really funny and I don't see how anyone could NOT like this film. I really really really want to watch the rest of the movie.,1
Love.,1
"OK, it was a good American Pie. Erick Stifler goes off to college with his buddy Cooze.",1
This is Brosnan's film.,1
"< br / > < br / > Anyway enough about the Naked Mile. First and foremost he lacks charisma, a Stifler prerequisite. You really can't care less about him. She shines above him as does the rest of the cast. There are weak points though.",1
"Ti % s and As *, lots of boobies. This feels like really OLD SCHOOL.",1
i was rather surprised at the end though. it is not gonna become classic as the first two already did.,1
"Thanks for reading! < br / > < br / > * Many comment about the amount of nudity in this movie. what would you like to see... smart books, romantic stuff?",1
This movie is plain fun.,1
"The entire cast does fine work. Classic. The gags are a plenty, and they DID NOT hold back in this one.",1
!,1
"Horribly bad, but good.",1
I think its the best thing he's ever done. This film is fantastic.,1
"The storyline is also great. She moves in with a guy who becomes her lover. In the end though, they find out truth.",1
Drew Barrymore is very hot. And scene with Dr. Wallace? Nathan was a very handsome cat.,1
< br / > < br / > I didn't get the ending! I liked it!,1
"Hope Davis is well cast as the "" gem of a wife "".",1
I noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on Dodie Smith's novel. And what on earth could dogs'home do with such a huge sum of money?,1
"Overall, nice. This sequel is inferior, but not bad at all.",1
"All covered in mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in the "" tin can. "" I say, that's about 28 years - in dog years!!!! ! Now, 4 years later, she, unfortunately, was released from the jail.",1
His'Wicked Witch of the West'homage is hilarious.,1
"Check out Sutherland's toilet in a particular scene,, very unusual.",1
"But the focus is squarely on the humour. < br / > < br / > So far, so stupid. It is funny.",1
That Bond guy is gone. And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? Do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one.,1
"Here is perhaps one of the finest. Max Winkler. It's called "" Sergeant Ryker. "" He is convicted and sentenced to hang.",1
"Highly recommended. Engaging, riveting tale of captured US army turncoat who has to prove his innocence to avoid the hangman.",1
"Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. nothing was revealed to sooon in the movie,, so as to keep you guessing at all times.",1
"As his fellow secret - service agents pursue him, he tries to prove his innocence. This thankfully wasn't unnecessary like most subplots are to these kinds of films. < br / > < br / > The plot is familiar.",1
"Anyone remember "" Sledgehammer ""? ). I got it because it was directed and has a choice cameo by none other than Detective Meldrick Lewis!!",1
Carla finally gets laid. They get the $ money $.,1
Just a typical Hollywood film.,1
Disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes. And who were the real villains anyway? - I kept expecting CJ or Charlie to appear! And did they use the'West Wing'set for the White House scenes? Nothing was developed or explained sufficiently.,1
Eva Longeria.,1
Are there holes in it? Douglas does a fine job in this role. I enjoyed this film.,1
Tsk. < br / > < br / > There are shades of Clint Eastwood's In the Line of Fire.,1
It works! Guess what?,1
I never did get who he was or what his issues were. Very much worth seeing. Surprises throughout delighting throughout.,1
"The boy returns happily to his fish, none the wiser. Both films are similar in their dream - like quality.",1
"From Kim Basinger's delicious first lady. For starters, the casting didn't seem right.",1
1942 costume designer did great job. Main song theme just lovely. Jeanette dancing was pure delight.,1
She makes a spectacular angel. The music in this movie is beautiful. The movie is a fantasy.,1
Surreal 40s musical seem to be making fun of 40s fashions even as they were in current vogue. She could do it all.,1
He should be a star. That is a baffling thing to say.,1
"Have recommended it to all my friends! ! I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. < br / > < br / > I look forward to another such movie, and will keep my eye out.",1
i wasn't disappointed.,1
I completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie. One was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top.,1
"Grady Harp so he comes with all the credentials to make the TV film version of Meg Wolitzer's novel SURRENDER, DOROTHY a success. The group seems jolly until a trip to the local ice creamery by Adam and Sara ) results in an auto accident which kills Sara.",1
What more do you want?,1
I really enjoyed it.,1
I. What if a platoon of G. No how's or why's. Undoubtedly it's the main order of the day.,1
"This is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific CV. '. etc etc ), "" aren't we better off here "" discussions and ultimately a huge battle.",1
"< br / > < br / > Optimum's UK DVD is a good transfer of uncut 138 - minute version. < br / > < br / > Of course, things don't go as planned, and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers. And yes, there are decapitations. What do you do?",1
But I did really like the concept. Which is what I'd like to think any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots.,1
Strange and weird. The background story is less important.,1
It's hideous. The huge battle is exhausting.,1
"What's the best way to start a review of a movie like Der Todesking? It isn't. What it is it low - budget art, put forward in a simple yet poignant way. In fact, the most disturbing scene I found was the last tale.",1
"It helps to make this movie an effective one to watch. This movie is a perfect example of his work. They are artistically made, with also often deeper meaning to its themes.",1
"Entirely unlike I expected, "" Der Todesking "" isn't exploitative or repulsively graphic! The subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful but also indispensable aspects of life. GREAT use of tragic music, too!",1
Disturbing art in purest form!,1
"It harvests us. This is a most realistic film. Who wants to live forever? "" At first glance it may seem very dark. Why?",1
There is also some unpleasant violence.,1
< br / > < br / > Buttgereit's movies are generally difficult to categorize and Der Todesking is no exception.,1
"Romy'sex appeal is unforgettable here. It is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons. """,1
Nicolas Mallet is a failure. And he manages to do just that. Definitely worth look.,1
"< br / > < br / > Their journey is a very learning one. Kalifornia "" is a great film that makes us look at ourselves.",1
Underrated. Spot on.,1
I was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute.,1
This movie is great!,1
"I've watched that scene at least twice now and I still think the acting in it is just wonderful. Pitt is dark, brooding and downright scary at times. He turned out a great performance in Kalifornia. But what I have seen is absolutely awesome! This movie was not one of them.",1
A top movie.,1
This proves very good writing and acting.,1
The first is its cast. We have a staggeringly disturbing turn by a young Brad Pitt as Early Grace.,1
Pitt is the walking definition of anbred Gothic refugee from Deliverance. But he and Forbes are flat broke. I have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film.,1
Kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals. The road of no return. It is one of the strangest couples ever. Don't miss it. A cruel ruthless murderer.,1
"Otherwise I kept thinking "" Agent Mulder "", which is a pity. It was realistic, tense, disturbing. Why haven't I noticed her before?",1
The same for Juliette Lewis.,1
Early is possibly drunk. Pitt is fierce in this film.,1
it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem.,1
Maybe it really does and I just don't understand it.,1
it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem.,1
"To which Early responds proudly : "" It sure does "". Duchovny's performance is flat. It's a road movie, with a killer on - board.",1
"Whoopi zonked out tranquilizers? That's how I feel about "" Rich In Love "".",1
Together they help each other to develop as people.,1
"That's cool, long as you recognize it as fiction.",1
"Kathryn Erbe, Det.",1
"I liked this a lot. In fact, if I see it again ( and I plan to ) I just may love it. You just get into it.",1
A really nifty and entertaining little winner.,1
"What's Sure, it's not "" The Godfather "", but it's not supposed to be. Well, okay, not really. A film about the mob that's actually from Italy ( how much more authentic do you want? )",1
"Great film, highly recommended to fans of Italian exploitation, and I hope to watch it again soon in its original version. On of the men behind the camera, responsible for the superb cinematography, was no less then Joe D'Amato. Tony Lo Bianco is terrific as the small thug pretending to be the city's biggest Don.",1
"In the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder. His movies are closer to Jean Vigo in "" L'atlante "", Jean Cocteau, and Guy Maddin, than Godard and Truffaut. It wasn't my favorite of the shorts, but it was the most unique, and the most iconic. """,1
"You don't want to hear it? Well, she can't and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place. What? Put yourself into Carla's shoes.",1
Funny and visually quite entertaining ending. 5. MNM and The Hardys are thrown in and it's all chaos. 5 / 10 < br / > < br / > The Boogeyman vs. One word to describe this eye - opener wow.,1
"Mercury is hurt. He is going to fight alone for the titles! Awesome! Let's continue. In the end, London and Kendrick retain the tag team titles. Kane v. MVP. He is at the hospital now. Get well kid.",1

His face was instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended Mercury's night early. to attempt to end the year on a high note. Be warned. < br / > < br / > The night opened with only the 4th ever Inferno match. There were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings.

Butch the peacemaker? ).,1
Nothing seems forced.,1
"And by who? In other words, spring! The concept itself is brilliant.",1
"Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. The visuals are exceptional.",1
I don't know.,1
< br / > < br / > There are some really priceless moments in this episode.,1
Enter Columbo.,1
It's definitely one of the better directed Columbo movies. It's also at the same time among one of the better ones! Robert Culp is truly great as the short tempered Brimmer.,1
"Ultimately, the finale fittingly epitomises that Columbo has always been one step ahead of the murderer.",1
"Memory - narrative, Resnais creates.",1
Master cinéaste Alain Resnais likes to work with those actors who are a part of his family. This is one of reasons why this film can easily be grasped. L'amour à mort is like a game which is not at all didactic.,1
I had no idea it was part of a larger series. I used to love watching this.,1
"To this day I still catch myself quoting it. The puppets were also well done, although a little creepy. Oh well, maybe I'll try e - bay...",1
Is it possible to purchase it from someone... somewhere? Compared to other satirical broadcasts it was definitely the best of all.,1
9 out of 10.,1
< br / > < br / > Hilarious fun.,1
"This was raunchy and crude, but thank god! They were all three in "" Eating Raoul "".",1
It is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie. Everything happens very slowly. It reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by Ram Gopal Varma. Sasha becomes an outlaw. < br / > < br / > Is the film worth it?,1
A woman borough a boy to this world and was alone. Everything else is to be watched... not told.,1
Acting is top notch all around.,1
"Cool you say, but no, this is real life.",1
Very wolverinish? The Watchmen? Unbreakable? This is where the vengeance and anger comes into play. This is not to say that action is not shown. The premise may sound familiar.,1
They try to run but it's hart to hide. But it is not about Mechenosets. And suddenly he meets her.,1
"However unlikely, the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar. Did Ridley Scott or anyone in the crew see the mini - series? And, my word, Blindpassasjer was first!",1
"I never ever thought of fact that this might have happened. OK. < br / > < br / > But why do they always speak English in the space future? I admit. But it did, actually, once, and even in my own homeland, Norway. Star Trek ( Next Generation ) was my first space date, and since then I've switched partners regularly. Because this is NOT the future, it's fantasy for kids.",1
"And like everyone else, I loved the outtakes! I hope the video has the new ones. Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental crap. But this one, like TOY STORY, the previous film from Pixar, is a lot of fun.",1
< br / > < br / > Devos and Cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong. Recommended. Grady Harp Enter Paul ( Vincent Cassel ) a recent released ex - con parolee who responds to an ad to be Carla's assistant.,1
""". < br / > < br / > A bug's life ( 1001 Pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks! )",1
I will definitely be getting this on DVD.,1
There isn't one of them that you cannot empathize with. I'm eager to see it again.. to pick up what I might have missed first time. Now this is what a family movie should be!,1
I saw it years ago. Bugs life is a good film.,1
< br / > < br / > Ant Island is the home of a colony of ants.,1
I rate this movie 10 / 10.,1
< br / > < br / > Paul is given a'going over'by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt. The leads are excellent ; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect. She is also deaf. It's now Carla's turn to enter a frightening new world.,1
to my opening comment. What??? The great difference is the way that the story takes.,1
"All the bugs are finely crafted too. It is very much a circle of life, but not one that can't evolve with the ages. < br / > < br / > When thinking about the animation, it is actually quite good. However, the story is top - notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with.",1
"The important thing is that it is still wonderful fun. It's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them, to imagine bugs the way a young mind does.",1
I just died laughing at that scene. I was right! Early Bird.,1
"Hopper was a pure and perfect villain. Even, Dot was cute.",1
"And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term < br / > < br / > After all, it's a film about ants. Surely they jest.",1
"< br / > < br / > Dreamworks can? t think for second that this is just a movie for kids, though. Don? The DVD also features "" Gerry? But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious. s Life "" standing as one of their greatest achievements.",1

"But, I'm glad to say, it's not! A Bug's Life has real heart. ).",1
A 7 out of 10.,1
An excellent piece of work! The Philippines substitute for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong.,1
Paul Walker even has small uncredited role here. They agree. I couldn't believe the ending though.,1
"Was it Clare Danes'Alice? I've long been a fan of her work, and this is no change.",1
5!,1
Talk about lack of closure...,1
I'm nitpicking though.,1
"In short, this should, by all rights, have been much darker movie than it was. Worth seeing.",1
We are left to guess. Her's was the best performance in film. The whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy.,1
This movie is no different.,1
"Very disturbing. Firstly, even though it would have been predictable and very Hollywood, I wanted a happy ending! And WARNING - SPOILER ALERT. It was awful in two respects. No, Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before. < br / > < br / > Also, I don't understand the ambiguity of the ending.",1
I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.,1
They were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison. - - I would definitely give this film two thumbs up.,1
You can see that from the beginning. We all have friends. But first I want to say what is good about the film. The film is photographed very well also.,1
"< br / > < br / > 7 out of 10. Very realistic, very captivating.",1
"Bill Pullman's performance is commendable, too. What would you do? """,1
It is very emotional and raw. But it can.,1
Now it's time for ultimate survival and true friendship.,1
Brokedown Palace is truly a one of a kind.,1
The relationship with the family members could also have used a bit more attention. I wanted to cry! The mental journey is missing here for some reason. This movie was simply too short to do this. Why?,1
I promise it will stick with you!,1
I saw this film at a store in the cheap section.,1
"Yet she finds an ami d'exploitation, if you like in Cassel's ex - con Paul.",1
"True to life, it ain't.",1
"Fysicaly he also looks in top - shape. And I mean that in a positive way, since I'm definitely ain't no Bay - hater. Director Raoul Walsh was like the Michael Bay of the'40's and years before that.",1
"Corbett and his manager ( Frawley ) despair of getting the money. However, help comes in the form of a very unlikely individual. < br / > < br / > Good film to catch Flynn at the height of his too - short time as a superstar. Despite this, he rises to fame, even working as an actor.",1
"Many of Flynn's characterizations were ( are? ) overlooked as great performances, and this is one of them. Unfortunately, this story is positively ludicrous. Director Walsh makes silliness look smooth and extravagant.",1
and a lovely supporting cast and it's pretty much perfect entertainment. Alexis Smith is Flynn'love interest. The pair are head over heels in love with fighting with each other.,1
Just to mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim.,1
"Possibly because he didn't have to wield a sword or be in a western. Of course that was not shown on the screen. He defeated John L. Sullivan and lost to Bob Fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown. Ward Bond got the career role of his life in playing John L. Sullivan. It is an enjoyable film, but hardly does tell the real story of James J. Corbett.",1
"< br / > < br / > What is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of Flynn as a boxer. First, Corbett was NOT a poor guy coming from a poor family, but was college educated and bright. Second, while he DID get Alexis Smith at the end of the film, they also divorced a few years later.",1
Here the idea is treated literally.,1
Alexis Smith was beautiful.,1
No.,1
"including a prominent judge. Frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as Flynn's manager. It ' Flynn is downright magical here. He is the epitome of charm, charisma and appeal in this role.",1
"None are more appropriate than GENTLEMAN JIM ( Warner Brothers, 1942 ).",1
The films is attractive and has a consistent style without being flashy. The film's finest scene perhaps comes when a beaten Sullivan comes to congratulate Corbett.,1
"You can just sense how much fun he was having here. Bond, too, was never better.",1
"My rating : 8 / 10. All of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists. < br / > < br / > Overall, Shaolin Temple is an enjoyable low - budget kung fu movie.",1
"At the end of the film, you too might be tempted to call out, Remember Shaolin Temple!",1
I rather think not.,1

"Here is where this review begins to crumble, it is all of these items but it is moremuch, much more. There is that moment of instant, unsettling attraction. Read My Lips "" is a drama.",1
"First of all, I don't understand why some people find this movie so anti - american.",1
I am still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant.,1
"He fails miserably. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are made as well.",1
< br / > < br / > The next comes from Mexico in which nothing is shown but the sounds of that day. I just recently watched this on the Sundance channel. It will bring back your emotions from that day. < br / > < br / > There are other films that I can't remember at moment but all of them are powerful.,1
Borgnine is very good and brave in it.,1
"This film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful. < br / > < br / > This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans.",1
But just as some of the clips are beutiful others are absolutely brutal. Same goes for Sean Penn's clip which is superb as well. Absolutely beautiful clip.,1
"And some of the pieces are actually funny, but not abusively so.",1
"Mutual dependency, for vastly different reasons, bonds them. Probably the best film of the year for me. Paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help.",1
Definitely worth every penny you spend. Films like this are rarely made and appreciated. This film tries to touch every possible core of WTC.,1
"This was a true story, and that was what made it so real. It was humourous yet just as powerful as the others. The piece that i found the best was the one from India. WARNING : SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Well, nothing. Ken Loach ( uk ) : September 11, 1973, The Chile entered in a twenty - years long bloody dictature. Very well done. Maybe the less tender movie towards the us.",1
would rather wreak revenge than make the world a safer place. the majority of the writers and directors choose to show that tragedy is not an American monopoly.,1
But in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone. Imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war. This is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the 6 year olds. < br / > < br / > Ironies abound in several stories.,1

The subtitles for one thing were difficult.,1
I then checked my TV listings and watched it again!,1

One of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex Yu. People in the west cant imagine how political situation in our country affect people.,1

"With it she hears almost normally. Not nice. She hasn't a boyfriend. < br / > < br / > "" Read My Lips? "" Exit the rival.",1
"The goal was for brothers to collect the haul, and the parents to claim the insurance. The plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless.",1
Nobody gets hurt. No guns. No problem.,1
"< br / > < br / > This movie isn't at that level. Like scary good. Nothing resonates on a deeper level. And I thought - - wow. < br / > < br / > Philip Seymour Hoffman is really, really good in this movie.",1
'The acting delivers as well.,1
"All action takes place in depressing, seedy and / or poorly lit locations. < br / > < br / > Audiard has fashioned some modern twists, of course. It's as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films I've seen all year.",1
I personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next.,1
Beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable.,1
"It's bleak as hell, unforgiving as Satan, but also absolutely riveting 90 % of the time.",1
"When an audit is scheduled in his department, he becomes desperate for money. Nanette reacts and kills Bobby but she is also lethally shot. My vote is seven. The violent conclusion shows that the world is indeed an evil place.",1
"The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil. Of course, like Hank, he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it. Two brothers, Andy and Hank, will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most. How? By robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run.",1
"The cast list is incredible, their performance top notch. I can only highly recommend it, the rest is up to you!",1
"Many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here, not least of which involves the use of his characters. 8 / 10. Amy Ryan also performs her job adequately.",1
"The performances are brilliant. We need more movies like. Also, I think the ending of the movie is perfect. I think this film is like a rebirth for Lumet.",1
"In fact, as you see, I rated it five stars. I certainly was not sorry. He has always been too quick to criticize and admonish. The crime goes terribly wrong - thus beginning an examination of the three men in the Hanson family. < br / > < br / > Younger brother, Hank is basically a screw - up.",1
"His life is beginning to crumble and he needs money. Andy proposes a low - key robbery of a small Mall mom - and - pop jewelry store that promises safe, quick cash for both.",1
Paul Angeli is a 25 year old and completely unskilled ex - convict. Fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie.,1
"I am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007's films. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a deviously stylish morality tale, and quite a dark, bleak and depressing one at that.",1
"I love them. "" Action is character, after all.",1
Most of the film is concerned with the aftermath. Albert Finney as their father seems to be in a constant state of rage but then the script calls for that. The robbery goes awry and two people die.,1
! What an extraordinary crime thriller! I should mention that the non - linear storyline is quite easy to follow.,1
"Also amazing is how Lumet utilizes the multiple POV and shifting time - frame approach. At age 83, he has apparently made a deal with the Devil to deliver one last great film.",1
The end was great.,1
"Four stars out of five for me. < br / > < br / > Once you have seen this film, like me you may want to see it again. What a good example for screenplay writers, actors, directors and cinematographers to follow. You must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place.",1

Most film is not art. The trick to loving the film is being able to enjoy this playfulness. The film only feints towards these genres and others at times. It dominates too much. Instead it is a visually interesting film. There are none of these.,1
"Perhaps watching again will change that. This is an interesting and visually captivating film, but many viewers will find it an overly long discourse about very little. Life is sort of like that : we look, see, observe, integrate, process, and make of it what we will.",1

"Why, they can't shed a single tear because their heart is full of Magick. They don't have time for silly things such as love. "" Queenie. < br / > < br / > "" Witches can't cry.",1
"I have seen the movie a half a dozen times, and I never can. as a befuddled writer.",1
The cast is terrific.,1
"this is a wonderful film, makes the 1950'S look beautifully stylish. Perfect.",1
"The movie is loads of fun. Stewart, in his last foray as a romantic lead, costars with Novak as he did in Vertigo, and they make an effective team. He supplies the warmth, she supplies the coolness, and somehow, together they spark. In The most expert of them is the sultry, soft - voiced Gillian, who would love to be normal.",1
This movie grabbed my interest after first 5 minutes and would never let it go. I have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good. Boy was I wrong!,1
"Well, the wooden man tries again and again to chase away the hand and do his own thing. Generally, I am not a huge fan of stop - motion films and at first RUKA didn't capture my attention.",1
Then he goes about making a pot. Everything else is clay. ).,1
A must see.,1
He becomes brainwashed ; an intellectual zombie. That was obviously not acceptable. An absolutely brilliant film!,1
"Yes, Louella's in the film as well.",1
Now I understand. They crash. The character was a butcher now soldier.,1
Shahid has done fine work. Sweet film of the year.,1
"< br / > < br / > First, it treats Anton Newcombe as a disappeared person.",1
Dig!,1
"I was pretty much mesmerised throughout. ). Damn, was that a lot to take in.",1
Although DiG! And the rivalry between the Dandy Warhols and Jonestown has been milked.,1
"on DVD. "".",1
"com and being intrigued by the premise. Most of what you see is of the bands on tour. I recently rented this doc, having remembered hearing about it from IMDb.",1
In Dig!,1
They are the most dysfunctional band. < br / > < br / > Anton is very unstable.,1
"The human ( imperfect ) element was also woven in, to create some drama and drive the plot, as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution.",1
The movie is about Anton Newcombe.,1
A really cool flick.,1
DiG!,1
"Anton Newcomb's case is more interesting. But why? Because, one suspects, this is not about music.",1
"It's rare to follow a group so closely for so long. I couldn't find anyone to watch DiG! To me, this just shows how powerful good music can be.",1
Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols. Sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world.,1
These are the people who really enjoy the film. < br / > < br / > Type 1 : OLD PEOPLE.,1
Her air time in the film was pretty short though. Hmmmm... hahahah!,1
"Art immitating life? I watched this movie alongwith my complete family of Nine. Except, for the drama part.",1
No preconception.,1
The jokes were great! !,1
don't let subject matter put you off.,1
And it's still not at the top of my list.,1
"Not a serious, but hilarious adventure.",1
!,1
"His fee is exorbitant, but they agree. What Jane loves to do is to lose her virginity, at any cost.",1
She pulled it of flawlessly. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.,1
Gee! And very fine job by Branagh too!,1
One comes to care deeply for two of them.,1
"8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10. ).",1
"The movie is more than good, but not extremely good.",1
Top notch series. I would love to have this on video.,1
I could watch it all over again. Perfection.,1
< br / > < br / > It is that and more.,1
"As a period piece, it's more accurate than not.",1
"Boy, was he wrong! This film has it all.",1
"A melancholy violin tune fades with this image. Then he wants to build a rocket. "" Homer quickly anwers, "" Everything. """,1
KUDOS!! to all involved this masterpiece!,1
"Actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison. October Sky is a highly lauded movie, and it ¡ [UNK] easy to see why.",1
I loved October Sky.,1
The Rocket Boys went on to make great lives for themselves.,1
I don't like family films. And the music was very boring and bland. The best is easily Amrita Rao. So what was the flaw in the movie? Not one actor feels out of place. I am far from a fan of Shahid Kapoor. So a few plus points.,1
It is the epitome of an American story that is well done.,1
Not to be missed. He is a perfect actor.,1
They were shocked to say least.,1
The story is good. The characters are really good. Not bad at all!,1
GO SEE THIS MOVIE! I know I did!,1
"But, that's what you find out when you see this movie.",1
But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough.,1
And it is. Perfectly played all around.,1
Standing out in all of the glory : Laura Dern as Miss Riley. Homer is not exited about that future.,1
See It!,1
"Frankly, I don't know but I liked the story. He's likable, as are his school buddies in here. It's nice to see nice kids in a modern - day film. I would like to have a little less tension between the two.",1
2. ) This movie was amazing!,1
"Best of all, the film is uncomfortable. I didn't want it to end. And "" October Sky "" accomplishes just that. It tears at you, lifts you up.",1
I definitely recommend seeing movie! All age groups will love this movie! !,1
So we compromised.,1
Don't buy the DVD.,1
< br / > < br / > 3.,1
I rate this movie 7 / 10. The kid actors over exaggerate on many things.,1
I hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying.,1
Saw this today with my 8 year old. I thought it was cute.,1
awesome work.,1
But not immediately. Ewww!,1
I sat with my children as we watched this film.,1
"Another boy responds, "" Maybe he's crazy! "" and the entire group laughs uproariously. < br / > < br / > But once at the theater, the film won me over for a variety of reasons.",1
Haven't we all suffered this one time or another. You will enjoy it as much as they do! This was refreshing for me. and she is no bully!..,1
"For once, I did not guess the ending! Have fun!",1
It is a major problem in schools today.,1
It is a feel good fun film and not just Fear Factor for kids.,1
! The songs are BRILLIANT.,1
"Escargot Kid'Style? Her smile really warms up the screen. She's now 14 and is growing up to be a beautiful woman. It was also nice to see ), which might not be such a bad thing.",1
"But somehow, it did not ruin the movie for me.",1
Don't miss... We had even more fun the second time around and everyone raved about it.,1
"Nice theme. The show is really funny. With little extra tuning it can become a very popular show. But who the hell did cast Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich.",1
Patrick Warburton is the key.,1
Surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series.,1
"< br / > < br / > I hope for all actors sakes that CBS gives them a chance. David Spade's character, to my surprise, wasn't the whole focus of this pilot. It works for him.",1
i have seen worse. i also liked music. i think the gist of the story is original though.,1
!,1
interesting... very interesting.... So many plot holes from scene to scene. I have never seen such a movie before.,1
Ethan's ( Behr ) hair looked so Asian. There are some holes in the story but didn't really matter. Oh and it's from Korea which has put out some of my favorite movies. I liked Host but not my absolute favorite.,1
!,1
"There was humor throughout, too.",1
"Storyline is extremely simple. They really loved it and that made me feel good. Otherwise, don't bother!",1
He stays at Hollywwod Hotel ( of course ). You can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself. < br / > < br / > Still the movie isn't that good. Naturally they fall in love. I give it a 7.,1
"Of course both Powell and Louella went on to other radio venues. That's got studio in a tizzy. Powell hosted, sang, and kibitzed with Louella and her movie star guests.",1
"They end up singing "" Hooray For Hollywood "". She is not the only real person in the script.",1
This upsets Amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her. 9. I can't believe currently this movie is rated a 6.,1
in what I believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo.,1
! < br / > < br / > I highly recommend it. A fabulous film.,1
The wardrobe is fine.,1
"I give movie two thumbs up! ! She based the character on a real person. It was loving, warm and fun.",1
I will definitely buy it.,1
"As an aspiring screenwriter, I notice those things! ( I'm a dork ). So much so, that I figured I'd write in. Anyway, a really cute film that I recommend.",1
I remember him from WKRP. She was also in Austin Powers. I haven't heard them laugh like that in years! They need to make more movies like Domestic Import. Adorable!,1
The acting was great. I laughed the whole time. ).,1
Its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained. There will be lots of women crying at the end of the film. I liked this movies.,1
"Yeah, the poster is quite a horrible piece of work.",1
This could happen. < br / > < br / > Definitely worth seeing.,1
The rest is just details. A new love? Live. Can you love a mirage?,1
"For this and more I give this movie a solid 8 / 10. It might not work on a small screen, but it gave me goose bumps easily on a big screen. A set of talented actors helps him portrait a wide variety of characters.",1
Well i do disagreed with the other comment posted.,1
"5 different women are coping with their male partners and families. Surprisingly good for a first film, and worth the time in any standard.",1
I highly recommend it.,1
"All are transformed at the end of the movie. A telephone rings, a cigarette is lit, a song, etc. The shoe - theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor. Isabel ( Ángela Molina ) is a bored rich lady. But they are different. Several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters.",1
It could also be seen as a kind of documentary.,1
Hats Off to Suraj.. Director has definitely given it much thought and actors have done it to perfection. A story woven around a marriage.,1
"Even by European standards, yes.",1
"Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life, and I enjoyed it.",1
The genre is unique and not the typical expectation.,1
I look forward to viewing sequence.,1
"The character development is amazing. But then i asked myself what next? But it is so subtle you don't know how to read it! Where can someone else see this work? I first say this film as part of a "" black "" film festival. You can see the intention in the design from the start to the finish.",1
Showing the artistic diversity. It is so interesting where did this guy come from.,1
< br / > < br / > Clearly the movie belongs to Amrita Rao all way. < br / > < br / > Shahid Kapoor performs brilliantly too.,1
"That was plain nasty! < br / > < br / > Twenty years on from 1984, this film speaks loads about Prince's future in the music industry. ?. Maybe that is why Prince started to run out of steam during the 90's because he ran out of his fathers ideas?? The only person that digs your music is yourself! "" How about the musical underscore which makes Prince even more evil when he smacks Apollonia to the ground in two separate scenes!",1
9 Tracks. Hudson Horstachio is watching you!,1
He takes himself way to serious.,1
"< br > < br / > 9 / 10 Oh, boy, that sounded lame. The acting?",1
"Plus, she is very attractive.",1
"< br / > < br / > PS. HSSH was almost unbearable to watch in some places. Amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major star. Both have acted very well, especially Shahid who looks great in the film. ( I needed several ) If you're prone to crying - take a tissue!",1
"Plus, his dedication he puts into his performances is phenomenal. Prince made sure that every moment in the movie was done perfectly. The entire main cast were just playing themselves. They were always friends. Now that I've seen it again I couldn't believe what I've missed all these years.",1
Really good. 'This is an excell film. The follow - up sucked.,1
The movie blew me away. 1 with me.,1
"In the movie prince wasn't known as prince but as "" the kid "".",1
"Still, it adds charm to movie. Very hit and miss.",1
"), romance, and drama.",1
"Third, give this movie a break! Why?",1
There isn't to much to say without revealing the plot. The music is great.,1
Certainly the best this year until now. It is as simple a story for a movie as it can get. Will they pass this test?,1
There is no debate about his musical talent either then or now. It didn't disappoint. It got so popular that it became ridiculous.,1
I loved it!,1
"Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!! Purple Rain "" put Prince on map! Purple Rain "" is such a movie in this category! ! Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics!!",1
"He seems human and relatable. The musical numbers are well staged and electrifying. Prince is no doubt a musical maestro, albeit very eccentric. It is one of my all time favourite songs.",1
"There is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where Prince and The Revolution perform. It even makes Michael Jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years. The brand new 2 - disc anniversary Special Edition led me to buy it. ), it blew me away. < br / > < br / > I already can't wait to watch it again, I really can't!",1
"< br / > < br / > Lastly, there's Prince. That he can do this and still emerge as a flawed but vindicated hero is credit to the writing. How would a film about domestic violence be shot, then?",1
But this astounded me.,1
"Nothing more, nothing less. Vivah is by no means a classic.",1
Trust me.,1
This is a good film for 99 % of the duration.,1
It actually exceeded my expectations.,1
This affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending.,1
Who ever came up with story is one sick person. Call it hard or soft or something stupid like that. I would watch that over and over.,1
The actors look like they have a fun time. He make us laugh together the most. they doesn't look to real.,1
I love the sets and the location. Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester.,1
"She arrives as a governess in the household of Mr Rochester, utterly friendless and alone. But a dark secret, and severe trials, lie before them both.",1
All in all a brilliant film.,1
"Recently, I watched the 1996 version of Jane Eyre and was very disappointed. But watching this one almost equals to reading the book.",1
Rochester'was very good but I absolutely loved Zelah's'Jane Eyre '. Dalton's'Mr. I saw it as a full length movie in 2006. Using the title after such license is fraud. It was only faithful to avarice and arrogance of Hollywood.,1
"Good choice. Criticism of her performance as "" wooden "" is misplaced. < br / > < br / > I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. The two leads play off each other beautifully. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester.",1
"Oh to be loved by a man like that! I also think this is the only production to include the "" Gypsy "" scene done correctly. I have recently seen this production on DVD.",1
"< br / > < br / > I need not divulge anything in the way of plot here. The movie's success is, no doubt, due in no small part to their acting prowess.",1
"Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but the actress playing Jane is much too old.",1
i know it was made in the eighties for TV.,1
"Sooraj sir is back to what he does BEST. Yes, the central romance is naively visualized.",1
"Ms. Clarke shouldn't be tall Sorry. Jane Eyre is quiet, guarded. Some of the criticisms baffle me. Luckily, this version is actually about Jane Eyre's whole life.",1
I recommend it to all true Jane Eyre fans.,1
"I cannot imagine anyone else in their roles. Her story, which Bronte told through Jane's own eyes, was both sad and inspiring. < br / > < br / > I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte tale.",1
but so far there is none like it! I would say God'love is greater.,1
Don't miss this one!,1
"Another problem is the casting of the main characters. This "" Jane Eyre "" ( as it dares to call itself ) is indeed a slap in the face of Charlotte Brontë. < br / > < br / > There are three TV mini series, released in'73,'83 and 2006.",1
"Dalton!! I just love it and love it! This movie is now a part of me. yet, what a welcome irony!",1
I'd like to see it again because it's so good. The best one for me.,1
And it still is.,1
This production is a lengthy watch but well worth it.,1
"If you like everything to be perfect and make sense, avoid this one. ( Yes, some of us still have VCRs. : ) William Russ did a grand job as Hank.",1
"They are too fussy, too Martha Stewart. And Timothy < br / > < br / > And the sets don't fully convey the Gothic mood of the novel. < br / > < br / > I was irritated at first. < br / > < br / > Bronte wrote a darn good book. I felt like I was listening to a high school play. The lighting in this version is bad. I just can't see Bronte's Rochester abiding such Martha Stewart domestic arrangements. Rochester is, famously, not handsome ; Jane and Rochester are literature's famous ugly couple.",1
Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester. The plot is both haunting and inspiring.,1
"The dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book, which was very smart. She is so versatile that I didn't recognize her. Thanks, BBC ( PS... ). There's lots more at the beginning ( Young Jane at Gateshead and at Lowood. )",1
"Why? should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it. Someday I would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation. A classic novel that ends with the heroine writing "" Even so, come Lord Jesus! """,1
"Jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich Mr. Rochester. Dalton is attractive, certainly, but no pretty - boy.",1
DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a gem of its kind. < br / > < br / > This film never received praise it deserves.,1
"Unfortunately it did, and Anthony Jr. looks willing to avenge attempt on his father's life. With no recollection whatsoever of what happened to him, he's attending some kind of convention. To say it keeps up the excellent work of the season premiere is reductive too,'cause there's never been a far - from - great Sopranos episode so far. To call this episode brilliant feels like too little.",1
in this episode its about his preparation for his Death. < br / > < br / > But don't worry! Second part is what happens in real life. gonna re watch it till i get this.,1
"I'm not saying everyone should feel this way, but I do. He It wasn't like the normal Sopranos and I loved it.",1
A nice touch.,1
"( The stuff at the bottom of the stairs and... what Tony can't get to. ) Purgatorio. < br / > < br / > On to the allegedly "" random "" monk - slap scene.",1
"Actually, creator and writer of this episode David Chase did quite the opposite. B. I can't wait for next week's episode.",1
"Their relationship grew, but they didn't really. ).",1
I found the entire series on mysoju.,1
( not in perverted way! ),1
"He just seems to enjoy it so very much! Thumbs upish, I say.",1
etc. But Aestheically A +. B Movie?,1
"< br / > < br / > Family fun for everyone. The game play is basically "" kill 30 people, find switch to open door.",1
Maybe?,1
Dev Anand ( or Prashant ) and Zeenat Aman ( Jasbir / Janice ) are siblings brought up in single parent families.,1
"One must admit, that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent.",1
Zeenat gave her best and Dev as usual was remarkable. They have not been spoiled.,1
But the music by Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. She has forgotten her childhood and Dev too. We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz.,1
"I love the R. D. Burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story I found much to be moved by as I kept re - watching the movie. This one grew on me. Also the English translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch, and as loony as it is I am grateful to him for doing it.",1
"This movie treats the subject in an entirely different light. In spite of this, the love of the brother - sister is the winner.",1
The song was an instant hit.,1
I also enjoyed that.,1
"! Afortunately, this is a good a example.",1
"Anyway, I just did... And what a surprise.",1
It's basically what the movie Gómez Pereira.,1
This film is full of them. It is weird. The mermaid cult that eventually saves Genie makes no sense whatsoever.,1
"Their children are cast in the lead roles of a church production of Romeo and Juliet. Naturally, they fall in love. < br / > < br / > Even the family names of the two families are part of fun. "" The Capomezza's and the Malacici's are rival caterers in an Italian neighborhood in New York. There is not a sight gag or a punch line that doesn't click in this fast paced movie. On stage! The rest of us should love it!",1
! It was not degrading in any way.,1
( Spoiler Ahead.,1
"The reasoning then surely seemed sound. The story and Director Dave Fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic strip - like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little Henry. You know, "" What Fools These Mortals Be! "" Remember that one, Schultz? HENRY was a most popular feature in the Hearst Papers'line - up ; appearing as both a Daily and on Sunday's Color Comics Supplement, PUCK, THE COMICS WEEKLY.",1
"This movie is much better than I expected. < br / > < br / > My score : 7 ( out of 10 ) 88. I found it very engaging, though it was obviously made by an amateur.",1
"It also has shortcomings, given the undue influence of western pre - conceptions of Africans and, especially, Arabs.",1
"It's a very good film too, and I enjoyed it a lot. There's also lots of morality - questioning. The rest of the film is David trying to get her back. )?",1
He has a plan.,1
But she'll continue to see him in her dreams. I disagree with that criticism. Definitely Medieval - era ( though I don't think any specific year is ever given ). Flavia comes under the influence of one of nuttier nuns.,1
< br / > < br / > Spoiler alert! Post - feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism. In addition it is a realistic portrait of medieval society.,1
"It certainly wasn't practiced. After this, her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice. ).",1
"After all, this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in. Flavia, la monaca muslmana "" aka. """,1
At least for a half hour a week.,1
"She is a woman and that is all there is to it. There is so much that can be said about this film. It is not your typical nunsploitation. Certainly, there was enough torture on both sides. But, tragedy is to come.",1
This is a serious work deserving rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation. Perhaps coincidentally it was also director Gianfranco Mingozzi's singular attempt at narrative film - making outside of many well - received documentaries.,1
8 out of 10. You can't go wrong with it.,1
"< br / > < br / > Flavia is a downright mesmerizing film! Yet all this raw footage isn't just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds, mind you.",1
Let alone Loerrta Spang as Cassiopea was fantastic. I loved the original as much as new.,1
This movie is pretty good.,1
I wish they would produce more episodes. Or perhaps a movie.,1
"Hey people, what's up. So glad that you all enjoyed the film.",1
"This movie could not have been made under code. To me, that is a mark of a great film. Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions.",1
"com. Once again, we can say a fervent "" Thank You "" to IMDb. < br / > < br / > The biggest complaint I have is that so many really good actors are not given credit.",1
It wasn't like that at all. Instant chemistry.,1
She goes up on an accomplice to manslaughter. She talk / sings it in the manner of Sophie Tucker and quite well. I think some of material was later used for the MGM classic Caged.,1
"What's not to like? Ruby cuttingly remarks to Gypsy, her rival. "" This movie is witty, watchable and utterly touching. !",1
Despite their cynicism and cons they fall in love. And the direction is much better than you'd expect from Sam Wood.,1
"< br / > < br / > The plot and acting are pretty good. Well, the movie isn't exactly "" funny. "" < br / > < br / > Overall, 5 stars.",1
"It ain't Shakespeare, but it is well done. < br / > < br / > Brain - candy.",1
Is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story?,1
"The change in attitude is glacial, but visible. Any woman brave enough to try to go should be allowed! It is a brutish man's world.",1
"Only in this show. ) Yes, they are gay. That One word : suPURRRRb! < br / > < br / > Cast was marvelous.",1
"Passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the match. Rather than educating the male population, they deny privilege and rights to the women. But Jafar Panahi has a winner on his hands for those able to see it.",1
Which do you think the average person would know more / less about : Iranian cinema or Iranian football? The emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore.,1
"You actually think that you are watching a documentary. < br / > < br / > Like most of Panahi's work, his armature cast's performance was superb.",1
Great cinema?,1
"Still the prohibition persists. And, yet, the purpose of these women is not to rally behind a cause or to make a "" point. "" that flowed out of Communist Czechoslovakia as part of the "" Prague Miracle "" in the mid 1960's. ). """,1
Paternity will never let the women to be empowered. Her alias could not work for her. He is equally effective despite being conventional.,1
Offside 3. < br / > < br / > Here's a list of my top favourite football movies : 1.,1
The cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures.,1
Some ( teen? ),1
I don't know why some people criticise that show so much.,1
Why? Because it is a movie about oppression. I can't help you!,1
"That's what one of the girls said at the end. The ridiculous situation is well captured. I can feel the comfort coming from the radio, the drinks and the food, and of course, the kindness and consideration from each character to others.",1
"Young, independent women. It looks fantastic.",1
"One ( Aida Sadeghi ) is an ardent soccer player herself and so on. The thing is, most of the men around don't really care. "" < br / > < br / > As the film opens we breathlessly join one of the girls in a bus, with a father pursing a lost daughter. ).",1
Its a MUST see. The US State Dept. Don't miss this classic film.,1
Cinema is dead but still very lively.,1
"But of course, it's really a case of sexism. Not a great movie, but worth seeing.",1
The best are the characters. What a shame.,1
"One of funniest sequences takes place when a female "" prisoner "" is escorted to the men's room by a soldier.",1
"This film is being described as a comedy, but it wasn't a comedy at all. It was very moving to see the passion, disappointment and excitement of these girls. Australian ( and other ) film makers could take leaf out of their book. < br / > < br / > The filming the actual match and aftermath was astonishing. < br / > < br / > To me, the soldiers represented the current paradigm.",1
"Finally! It's all about football and its funny, its really funny. WHERE, where can I get hold of it? Dear reader, it's near - perfect. An Iranian film that is not made by Majidi, Kiarostami or the Makhmalbafs.",1
"They banter back and forth in almost real - time as the game continues, just off - camera. They beg the bored soldiers guarding them to let them go or at least to let them watch the match. Plus, he makes her cover her face so no one can see she's a woman.",1
"When they're caught, they're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot, but out of sight. Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. The prisoners plead to be let go, but rules are rules.",1
But anyway they looked the part.,1
! John Wayne as a diplomat?,1
"It's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though. Good job, Dreamworks. Hmm...",1
"The film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story. The human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations. The Baron responds that Japan just wants to be left alone. The two lead roles are performed to perfection. Eiko Ando is likewise excellent as the Geisha of the title, charming and delightful. This is very much not the sort of movie for which John Wayne is known. It lacks all pomposity.",1
He is not welcome.,1
Joe Vrs. Dark City is better. But the search will be worth it.,1
"Before I start, I should point out that I know the editor of this film. For another, the core performances are all good.",1
"It was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this all - star flick. I laughed through the entire picture, as did my entire family. Rob Reiner made a great laughing limo driver, and Gabriel Byrne a laughable neurotic. The cars and clothing were impressive, as was decorative, "" Vic's Place. """,1
"The overall package makes for fun, funny, watchable yet violent entertainment. I love this movie.",1
Bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic ace assassin Nick.,1
Father of the Pride was the best new show to hit television since Family Guy. < br / > < br / > The blame for this show's failure lies with NBC. The other stars of the show are the Sigfreid and Roy.,1
Very nasty villains.,1

Don't miss this one.,1
"The dialogue is wonderful, you can just lay back and listen. A place of love and danger.",1
This movie is great. Simply.,1
It's only a joke. Gabriel Byrne is priceless.,1
I am a lover of black comedy.,1
it is great. another is the cast.,1
David Warner is a good Bob Cratchit as well.,1
"Wow, what genius. Thank you Sci - Fi for another classic.",1
"Best idea ever! Also, the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream. is probably the best quote ever!",1
! Maybe it was just too clever for certain people?,1
"And that's the most contrived part of all. Hard to say. For this viewer anyway, those days are long over. Mason finds the top man, and is faced with a dilemma. He gives an honest and touching performance here.",1
"Moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder, as it were. Besides, the violence is not the point.",1
"How can we ever forget San Fernando Red? Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue? His wife, Georgia, died by suicide.",1
"< br / > < br / > Check this out if you are a fan or curious. He was riot. Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc.",1
He portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He is such a versatile actor. A wonderful movie.,1
Not a bad thing to be at all.,1
I've been in a couple of them. For me this movie was powerful.,1
"And it was rather cleverly portrayed. But I'm more prosy than poetic. < br / > < br > I may be easy to please, but I enjoyed it.",1
Excellent film!,1
"A small gripe, but one that makes it a bit less realistic. I'm hoping for a DVD release in the near future!",1
< br / > < br / > A solid first feature effort from director and writer Leonard Farlinger whose own brother died of AIDS. The ending is nicely done as well.,1
The musical score is endearing and heart warming.,1
Compliments to Brooke.,1
"I believe in that with all my heart. < br / > < br / > Rest in peace Marlene, you deserve it so much.",1
< br / > < br / > Highly recommended. Even one in the house seems to be knocking the boots. Ursula was smoking hot in this movie. Will the geezer fall for her car giver?,1
Another nice one is Ursula swimming fully naked in estate's pool.,1
Don't watch Edel & Starck. Seriously.,1
Will Felix get Sandra? < br / > < br / > The two main characters work beautifully together. ?,1
He was great.,1
"This is best version of A Christmas Carol, period.",1
"He also feels unhappy and unsatisfied in his Job. Oldies music, appears to be a comfort and "" Psychological "" crutch for him to lean on.",1
I have already become a Sandler fan.,1
Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. A powerfully wonderful movie.,1
"The two of them made a completely believable team, and Sandler in particular made Charlie real, working through his emotions and feelings. This is not a Sandler comedy.",1
"Now, I don't want to belittle their sufferíngs, but I sure would like to make a comparison. The Hollywood industry and writers such as Safran Foer more than allude to 9 / 11 in their works. I have to admit, this movie moved me to the extent that I burst in tears. On a daily We have a war in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Birma and lots of other countries. Ever since 9 / 11 the entire world is confronted with mementos, memorials and commemorations of 9 / 11. Always want to take about their feelings "".",1
1 Surround Sound. Which Alan hasn't seen Charlie in years. Cheadle is excellent as usual.,1
Adam Sandler is becoming a very well respected actor. One of best movies of 2007. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything.,1
There is inherent danger in the process. Cheadle's Alan Johnson is equally subtle and very Don Cheadle. It is Alan who has task of gingerly opening up Charlie's carefully sealed life.,1
What we've got here is a Situation. Charlie's desperation makes us see Alan's. You can't fix people.,1
"It was a very moving picture. Alright. The plot was easy enough to understand, I suppose.",1
"Filmed in the town of Shrewsbury, England, it just seems somehow very British. I adore his sideburns, his long topcoat & hat. < br / > < br / > This rendition has the best overall Christmas atmosphere, hopeful and optimistic. Somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending.",1
"Slowly, but surely, Fineman regains his trust for Johnson. He is a self man ( dentist ) who helps start a dental practice. This is an unwelcome surprise to Dr. Johnson since he is a married man with two children. He goes into completely denial and does his best to forget about his former life.",1
Some people may never feel loneliness at this level. A very fine film.,1
"He will make you weep, especially in his purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue. He is every man. It's much more subtle than, say, Babel, and has a much more close - to - home ideal.",1
"My first film from director Mike Binder,'Reign Over Me,'is an intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship.",1
His landlady is his protector and great enabler. Charlie has gone back to a time in his life when he had no family. There may be spoilers! Alan is stuck in a life that he knows is no longer fulfilling. place. He feels friendless and out of touch with his own reality.,1
My vote is seven.,1
"He might even be typecast for characters with such hidden anger problems. However, it is Sandler and Cheadle that give some of their finest work to date.",1
The feel of this movie was amazing.,1
"My in - laws didn't get it! I took it very, very hard.",1
How rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain. Greetings again from the darkness. < br / > < br / > Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent.,1
Love hurts.,1
"< br / > < br / > This movie isn't funny like Borat or Billy Madison but it has a good pace about it. Don Cheadle was believable as always. I was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what I expected. But I will say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. I'd say 90 % of the audience laughed for most of the film. He was funny, and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies. I saw this at a screening last night too.",1
"The soundtrack, which is almost another character in the plot is wonderful. < br / > < br / > This is a breakout role for Adam Sandler. This film screened last night at Austin's Paramount theater as part of the SXSW Film Festival.",1
I feel there is no need to tell you anything more.,1
Patrick Stewart He laughs too much. How on earth did the film gain the'U'certificate? ).,1
Very good!,1
There are so many twists and turns in this film that I have a sore neck from watching.,1
"The plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes. John Dahl's film on the other hand, truly deserved to be described as such. James M. Cain would have appreciated it.",1

"I'm sure he has his followers, though.",1
Amazing how things have changed! ),1
"Red Rock West "" is a movie - lover's movie. Mr D. Hopper is comfortably cast as the hired killer, like Mr Cage a USMC veteran. Tempted as he might be to drive on, he takes the man to hospital, where it turns out he has been shot.",1
"While leaving in a violent rainstorm, he runs down Suzannes lover. He is honest to a fault, but always on the dark side of fate. < br / > < br / > The film was very well cast.",1
The role was not written keeping his personality in mind. Dahl written the script with good duration of lenght. There were too many close up frames. Hopper played his part well. But I feel he was miscast for this role. Its a shame since the man had talent.,1
"With really nothing else he can do, he decides that for once he's going to lie. Hopper, Boyle, and Walsh are all fun to watch in these parts.",1
"RRW delivers all these and more. All you need is a smart script, good actors and loads of atmosphere.",1
"Overall, Red Rock West is a film that you're unlikely to regret watching. The plot focuses on the overly moral Michael ; a man travelling across America looking for work. It's thrilling throughout, and you can't ask for much more than that!",1
"I'm sorry if I scared you. "" Also, it totally fit the story. < br / > < br / > Best quote? What a gift.",1
But this might be his regular look. < br / > < br / > Cage looks indeed rather groggy or dizzy or very confused and having a severe hangover.,1
"Well, you have to watch and see. Does Cage stand a chance? Yes.",1
"The Horror, "" indeed! < br > < br / > Actually, I myself don't consider Scott's glib rage a liability. But other "" Christmas Carol "" purists might.",1
8 pts. Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here.,1
"< br / > < br / > The next afternoon, I followed their advice. The sets and the music contribute a great deal to almost every scene.",1
"Cage : "" That's right, no. < br / > < br / > Boyle ( to Cage ) : "" You're not a killer? "". """,1
A real sleeper. Not a slow minute in this film. Cage is at his best.,1
It isn't often that minor characters like deputy sheriffs have more brains than their headlining superiors. An excellent movie.,1
"From this point of view, the coincidences are not script flaws at all. It's his final layover in a journey to... the twilight zone. Ordinarily, I would agree.",1
You'll have fun watching this. Not many.,1
Cute symbolism.,1
"The joy he brings to Fred, to his wife are so apparent. The supporting cast is very well done. Some have said his portrayal too gruff. And after all, we are none of us past hoping. < br / > < br / > I will try anyway. I couldn't disagree more. < br / > < br / > Bravi tutti! David Warner is also a totally believable Bob Cratchit. The music is sweet.",1

< br / > < br / > It's wonderful.,1

How can Sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity?,1

"< br / > < br / > If Sidney thought that his invention would make him a hero, then he was sorely disappointed. Such well - known titles include'Whisky Galore! < br / > < br / > Sidney Stratton is poor and unappreciated, but he has scientific talent in great abundance.",1
"The decade the film was made is a crucial point to note, the making of nuclear weapons became more than just hearsay, science was advancing to frighteningly new proportions. Often tagged as a comedy, The Man In The White Suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and there.",1
It still looks the same now. Scott's is big and imposing. < br / > < br / > I love this movie.,1
But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. I enjoyed this film.,1
There was something magical and useful in Science. I don't think she was as impressed as I was!,1
"This film is no exception. I'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well. It's comical British understatement at its finest. Yes. "" - and characterisation is first rate.",1
"Two men block his way. "" Cut. Guiness dashes out the open door.",1
"He sees Guinness as selling out to the rich. They seek to suppress the invention. < br / > < br / > In the end, Guinness is defeated by science as well as greed.",1
"The complexities of the relationships between science, business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined. Of the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger do stand out.",1
Ernest Thesigner is very notable as a heavy.,1
Scott does so easily.,1
"The plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks. Of course, this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles. < br / > < br / > Like a lot Ealing comedies, this one stars Sir Alec Guinness. I recommend this movie, basically, to anyone that is a fan of movies.",1
"The funny thing is that it'not even romance. < br / > < br / > Also notable is Dapne's role. It's more admiration, and perhaps even inspiration. No. He's never really intimidated by people.",1
"< br / > < br / > "" Knudsen!!!!!!! """,1
The complex interplay of vested ( should that be suited? ) And of what other film can it be said that the hero literally wears the plot? Hmmm.,1
"Very, very frustrating. co. uk / joking _ apart _ S1. hm replaydvd.",1
Please! Moffat is a genius.,1
"Venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun? His acting in "" Deliverance "" was superb.",1
The photography is excellent as well. In very bad ways.,1
This movie is a masterpiece.,1
"Each of the travelers is outstanding, although Voight gives the lead and strongest performance.",1
I certainly did. Just don't expect picnic.,1
"The soundtrack is particularly noteworthy. None really, in fact. It was Voight himself. The location was really chosen well.",1
"'I had seen two films at the Dome prior to this : "" Grand Prix "" and "" The Song of Norway. "" < br / > < br / > Watching it today, thirty - six years later, it still gives me quivers. The sound quality is second to none, from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks. It's all up to you, Ed? "" After leaving the theater, I was shell - shocked. I was but fourteen years old. The photography, cinematography... all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate. Well this wasn't exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch.",1
"Renyolds'character is an experienced adventurer, sort of no nonsense, and filled with machismo.",1
"It's an all - time classic. Movies that make you think. The story feels real. It's true. He really doesn't "" know nothing '. "" This is one deep movie.",1
"I give it eight out of ten stars, extremely impressed. You cannot go your whole life without watching this film.",1
It's awesome.,1
"Under great emotional stress, the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area. 9 % of the world's population. Though it is not a horror movie, it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film.",1
It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. I can't really say much more than that. Bottom Line : This movie is a classic.,1
This is not a Hollywood film. < br / > < br / > This is the kind of thing that we see in Deliverance that sets up so much of the tension that is to follow.,1
""".",1
That says a lot.,1
< br / > < br / > Just unbelievable. < br / > < br / > The acting is mostly good. Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby.,1
"Lewis's leg made me wince. But that is misleading beyond belief. What can morality drive us to do, or not do, some cases?",1
"I think Beatty's traumatic shock afterward was well done. Some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal. The river trip never left you bored, for sure. It was confusing when Ed killed the other guy later, at the top of the cliff.",1
"As he is forced to review his life, we see him alternately softening, and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy. Scott has made Scrooge utterly believable and painfully human.",1
"Often known for its "" SQUEAL! "" A must - see film for those willing to take a chance.",1
< br / > < br / > The acting is universally excellent. In that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible.,1
Especially Jon Voight. !,1
Direction and editing are flawless. Dialogue is interesting. And that is another strength of the film. And the acting is terrific.,1
"There are no demons or bogeymen here. They shock because their evil is petty and tangible. The conflict and violence within movie seems to erupt out of nowhere, with a frightening lack of logic. The film has aged well.",1
"Although so much of it is excellent of itself, Deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been better. The movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively.",1
"You just really begin to feel for him. And how surprised was I! Triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the most well - crafted as Dan starts to loosen up with regard to Marie. The look she gives him when he repeats her comment, about not liking Ruthie - sheer Green - Eyed Monster!",1
"< br / > < br / >'Dan In Real Life'lacks nothing for being without the regular vices. It flows at just the right pace throughout. Put aside any prejudices because this is a must see! At the same time, the theme is entirely adult. This is a sublime piece of film - making.",1
"It is a good movie, watch it. Marie is the girlfriend of his brother.",1
I believe that if Dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it. It's not spectacular scenery per se but it's real. Scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to Scrooge.,1
"What a top notch cast. Why, yes he did. < br / > < br / > Steve Carell. < br / > < br > Denied love.",1
"While there, he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman. No.",1
I loved it.,1
"And thus begins a roller - coaster of restrained longing and funny love - budding. There are wonderfully awkward family moments that aren't unrealistic. I loved "" Dan in Real Life "".",1
"Along the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to take a decision. Follow the advice of Dan's column and plan to be surprised with the reunion of the Burns'family. My vote is eight.",1
"The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found. Still a fun movie. Steve Carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices, family and pressure.",1
"Mr. Carell, in fact, keeps getting better all the time. After all, she is the date of Dan's brother, Mitch. They just serve as incidental music for decoration.",1
I ended up enjoying it quite a bit.,1
"This is exactly the case for Dan Burns ( Steve Carell, the Office ) a columnist for the local newspaper. Just "" put it on my tab. "" There is a scene in Dan in Real Life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first. The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's Law : anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. Besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious.",1
"The meanness of him, but with trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change. < br / > < br / > Patrick Stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of Scrooge. The characters in this film are middle and lower class. Still love and happiness radiate their home, no thanks to the guy Bob Cratchit works for.",1
"make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love. Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girls. < br / > < br / > What's a man to do?",1
"His entire Sound familiar? There is only one problem really. I'm Dan. After that tragedy, Dan was left to raise their three daughters alone. She is already seeing someone. And so he became more functional than feeling.",1

The characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors. < br / > < br / > I only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better. The story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up.,1

"It's a rollicking - if mind - numbingly stupid - action classic. I generally don't watch movies knowing that they're going to be bad, but I made an exception for this one... and I was very glad that I did. She's priceless.",1
"Sick, dude! Superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80's exploitation, hooray!",1

Once he is at home, Dona Lola, his scolding wife, wants to know why the Colonel refused the money when both of them are starving. With maximum dignity, the Colonel rejects Nogales'offer, picks up his fighting rooster and walks away as nobly as his old legs can carry him.",1
Lola still grieves the death of their son Augustin some time ago. My vote is eight.,1
They're perfect team.,1
Then his character changes to one who is truly repentant.,1

Tom Hanks like you've never seen him before. Make room for some Oscars!,1

This is a beautiful film.,1

ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newman's score.,1
But this movie is indeed different.,1
It was nominated but didn't win.,1
"But Rooney's son Connor is even more evil than the rest. As the movie ends, somewhat predictably, one character is saved and one character repents. Frankly, this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors. Jude Law plays Maguire in suitably creepy way. < br / > < br / > Sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price, even at the terribly high price of perdition.",1
This is one of the best made movies from 2002.,1
"Scott is properly gruff as Scrooge. Bah! But hey, this is George C. Scott.",1
His work is just awesome. Conrad Hall went out with a bang. Huh?,1
Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for his work here.,1
He loved it - and the discussion. ),1
"The shot starts at the front of the car, revealing Mike ( Hanks ) through the windshield. Mike Sullivan had no father as a child, so John Rooney took him in. Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career. This couldn't have been better. The scene when Mike and Michael are in the car, entering Chicago is quite impressive.",1
"Conrad Hall is a true genius. He was incredible! But it doesn't stop there. Paul Newman, good as always. The screen Writing is worthy of an Oscar.",1
"They are shown so deeply, strong and believable.",1
In the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected. There is an internal logic rare in these films.,1
< br / > < br / > GREAT! I just wish i came across this earlier then i did!,1
! Fight scenes!! So what if it's not all original? Humans become flesh eating cyborgs!!,1
"All in all, it's a good film for fans of the genre.",1
"George C. Scott was born to be Scrooge, just as he was born to be Patton.",1
Only one way to find out.,1
"Wow baby, this is indeed some fine Asian horror / gore, and a crazy outlandish movie. hmmm, yum yum.",1

"< br / > < br / > 7 out of 10. Why "" Tetsuo ""?",1
"I'm happy. First of what is "" Meatball Machine ""? Acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film. And yes it too luckily shows more violence. I doubt I'll ever get a chance to see the original so I'll just stick commenting on this one. Will he succeed?",1
But they all did a good job.,1
Great job from Gokbakar brothers.,1
"It's a study in perfection. And what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor ; to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous. This 1984 version of the Dickens'classic ` A Christmas Carol,'directed by Clive Donner, stars George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge.",1
"Scenario and acting is quite good. It was far better than I expected. The mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought.",1
"And, who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out?",1
It is not on VHS or DVD.,1
"Best thing I ever did. Should this gem ever find its way to a DVD release, I'll be at the front of line.",1
"< br / > < br / > this show, however, i would recommend to anyone. I'm ready to ASSURE you that you will enjoy it.",1
Another thing is the characters. Wow... We all know this famous story.,1
"Eventually, after about two days, I grew obsessed. Frankly, I wasn't getting anywhere. It's a very crafty fun loving story. I even took it home for a few more reads over. INTENSE martial artists. For Genma, that was a PANDA, and for Ranma that was a... girl! I don't know how I did it... but I couldn't stop.",1
"On opposite sides of the law, we see within each character not the black and white, but the shades of grey. So begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of Hong Kong.",1

"Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister. Dog Bite Dog isn't going to be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it.",1
It's visually arresting and the sound design is very unique.,1
Wai's chief is his dad's friend and is worried about Wai's erratic behavior. Knives to neck and torso.,1
"Stabbings, shootings, merciless beatings : all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheang. However, it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch, particularly if gritty, hard - edged action is your thing.",1
"I knew it was a rough crime drama going in, but being the first Cat. He eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy, before he escapes back to Cambodia. Great movie, highly recommended.",1
The police characters also defied my expectations thoroughly. This is one of my least favorite things about the genre.,1
Did this film live up to my expectations?,1
"However, as many have pointed out, this is not a movie for everyone. One is about love, and the other is about redemption. WOW. The music is also worth mentioning. Much like Salo, this one shows us the dehumanization of the human spirit. Is violence really that necessary? He is ruthless, vile and beyond likable.",1
"Pang, the hit - man, is a Cambodian orphan and has been trained to fight & kill for money ever since he was a child. He knows no restrictions, has no mercy and barely speaks a word.",1
Chilling performance by Edison Chen.,1
"Dog Bite Dog retains numerous traits recalled from that horror project, namely rundown urbanscapes and a pervasive air of something eerie lurking round the corner. Finally we have before us a Category III movie for the summer 2006 season.",1
Unlike other movies main character is a boy.,1
"< br / > < br / > The art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography. You either see it or miss it and there's no time to observe, to comprehend. Someone else liked them, too, because my David Hamilton books were stolen. In one book were seen a few pictures of a young boy, obviously nude, intimate with a young woman older than he, also nude. Women, too, may have similar thoughts, but all such considerations must be pushed out of one's conscious mind. Hysterically, the worst assumptions have become automatic and matters of children and sex are rigorously avoided. Though discrete, there was strong sexual connotation. Guys will think "" Lucky Julien! """,1
This movie documents the Harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties.,1
I joined the House of Theieves.,1

Cant recommend it more. Never dull. Cool.,1
Fifteen years later and Paris Is Burning is still aflame.,1
Thank You! The words and wit were just as sharp as moves on the floor.,1
Homophobia and racism all together. The balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here. That's kind of sad. ? Where's the DVD??,1
"When Queens were really proud to be extroverts. An excellent documentry. This is a good pre "" homo thug "" movie. That time is gone forever.",1
It is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989. Anthony Slide's'Great Pretenders'says nothing.,1
It's real life.,1
There are shots in this movie of nude transsexuals.,1
See this movie! !,1
Darius Goes West is an amazing roller - coaster of a story.,1
What a ride!,1
I am not sure why. No attempt is made to glamorise the police. Not one to relax you. This is the world we live in. Let's face it.,1

It played twice over the course of the festival. It is snowballing out of control. Please go see this movie!,1
Martha Sweeney.,1
People in the theater were sobbing.,1
That line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. This was the best movie I've ever seen about Bulimia. It has to do with them and them only.,1

I gave it a 10.,1
He attempts to woo her every chance he gets and he certainly makes attempts! Taking that risk was a good idea because it's end result is an exceedingly good film.,1
"However, I ' There was a TV commercial in Japan couple years before this movie came out. The only reason I'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played Tadashi's tormentors were not up to the job. Hint : this would not happen in a Disney film.",1
"why? This movie has a lot of laughs, Lots!",1
Quite by accident actually.,1
"Oh well. Not good. Overall, twasn't really a bad movie.",1
< br / > < br > They need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane.,1
"I liked especially Lexa Doig's acting. Warning! < br / > < br / > Bottom line is, I liked it very much.",1
What worked exceptionally well was the middle portion. One of the team's better films and it almost earns a 9.,1
"Stan goes up to have a look, and Ollie, standing on the attic door of the roof, falls into the greenhouse. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Stan asks if he was hurt, and Ollie only answers with "" I have nothing to say. """,1
"His mum must be proud. Everything about it was superb. The acting the characters, the story.",1
Great fun. < br / > < br / > Rating : 5 stars out of 5.,1
Guess what happens next?,1
"Meanwhile, Stan & Ollie are chimney sweeps who show up at the Professor's home the very day he perfects his solution. """,1
"Why? Also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him. Rideau, on the other hand, is great.",1
So maybe things will go better for him in the future.,1

"The first love, in its terrible progression ecstasy - despair. The sex is not avoided nor exploited, it is treated as it is, with no exhibitionist intention. In a land far from where he lives, Mathieu spends is days at the beach with his sister.",1
"This was a polished, very professionally made motion picture. < br / > < br / > Spoiler of sorts follows.",1
But isn't that what life is like? Why? My appreciation of this movie increases.,1
Beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could.,1
"By turns heart - breaking and uplifting, this film ranks with "" Beautiful Thing "" as must - see cinema. Soon, the two are falling in love.",1
"But it is better than many of you have said. Maybe "" Presque Rien "" is not the best movie ever made...",1
We are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action.,1
"< br / > < br / > If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you would like to stop reading. Mathieu feels the attraction for Cedric too. Mathieu appears to have learned his lesson, hard way. The film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended.",1
Worth a watch.,1
"It has some beautiful cinematography, much as would be provided in a CGI film of the same decade. Viewed in the right mood or with right friends, it is exciting, moving & touching. The Yokai Monsters series is not the equal of Majin at its best, but the Yokai are nevertheless great fun. It is alternatively known as Big Monster War or as Ghosts on Parade.",1
"After I finished watching it, I felt the same. I disagree with other posters that say it's'too artsy.",1

"Tony Shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans. Roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them. The only surprise to me was finding that Jay was also Paulie's voice. That's normal for him, it seems. I will, however, admit that a happy moment colors my review of "" Paulie. "" What's not to like? Watch movie and that will make sense. ( "" I'm Russian...",1
That part might bother younger children. It's a touching reunion.,1
The movie was so inspiring to me. Love overcame all obstacles.,1
I recommend this movie to anyone any age.,1
Paulie is a lovable little treasure.,1
I gave it 10 out of 10.,1
Or to anime like Samurai 7.,1
Will he find his long lost Marie or not? It was SO good! It'll touch your heart. I absolutely LOVED this movie! That's when the adventure begins.,1
Spoiler This is a great film about a conure. This film also has some sad parts that make tears run.,1
Paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory. A sentimental story with a sentimental sound track. < br / > < br / > The parrot is definitely the star of the film.,1
Not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion.,1
"The two of them became birds of a feather ( OK, bad pun! Of cage that is! And not a few phrases either. ).",1
Don't miss it!,1
"A lot people get hung up on this films tag as a "" children's film "", and that it certainly is, though it is one made for adults. Takashi Miike uses the fantasy genre, particularly, the children's fantasy genre, as a springboard into the wild territory that is the Great Yokai War.",1
"< br / > < br / > Oh yes, Paulie had a plot. Ever. The plot held thick and entertaining throughout, keeping me attracted.",1

!,1
"This has to be Miike's most expensive movie, and it looks fantastic. "" 1. It's actually one of my least favorite of the director's films. Most of what I liked came from the technical side of things.",1
There is also a few other songs not put on the CD. The show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show.,1
"The story itself is inspiring. While she learns to speak correctly, so does Paulie.",1
"This awareness has also meant The League of Gentlemen undergoes a bold evolution, not usually seen in a show of this nature. No visit to them is the same, and each time they offer us up with a surprise.",1
The TV works consists of 3 series and a Christmas special. That was only a few of the strange inhabitants.,1
"< br / > < br / > Fans of horror will love it, fans of comedy will love it. As any traveler It's that creepy.",1
"LB has nothing on LoG! This is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius. I first saw it on Comedy Central several years ago. ( No offense, Matt & David.... Love you )! So, on my own, I made the best out of it that I could.",1
"The film adaptation is best demonstration of this, but some fans may decide they belong local. !",1

! < br / > < br / > Well done BBC!,1
"Nonetheless, give it a try.",1
"This is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies. By the end of this movie you will feel good. It's a formula that is used a lot. Watch it as it is and you will enjoy it. < br / > < br / > Here's basically what this movie made me to. There is something about this movie I felt about TMNT that really made me love it. So don't over - analyze or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.",1
"Funny and incredibly irreverent beyond belief - - you have to see it to believe. In particular, animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show. !",1
Not for kids. Thought - provoking.,1
But.. a warning. Bravo!,1
The creators of The Matrix say that it is'anime inspired '. The 1980s.,1
But it's still cool. Not just animation style but several character designs.,1
< br / > < br / > never laughed half (! ),1
Though I do think the ending is flawed. Fox proved she is capable to play a hot starlet with her head in the clouds.,1
"< br / > < br / > I enjoyed this film, but boy was it a chore at first! However, give it a chance. So who is the audience in the West? In fact, you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time.",1
Enjoyed it. He's a Legend.,1
"He is making a career out of lampooning celebrities, although he has a desperate wish to be a celebrity himself. < br / > < br / > Complicating matters are two very different women. He offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of Young, but he also has what can only be described as a liberal tolerance of Young's off - - wall antics and inappropriate behavior. < br / > < br / > He is at first thrilled to go work for a major publication ( called Sharp's Magazine in the movie ), and despite active nerves he is positively beaming on his first day.",1
This time it was larger than we expected. we need our stars! To impressions!,1
"I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. the character of Young is full and reasonable.",1
"But the rest of the film's acting was not worthy enough to feature here. "" He is uproarious, daring, and moronic.",1
Well it was a nice surprise after all.,1
< br / > < br / > 7 out of 10 I liked the film.,1
Neither did How to lose friends and Alienate People.,1
"That's my impression of this film, anyway. Much like the Bean character Rowan Atkinmson plays. His role here, though, took a completely different turn. It DOES get better, however. Hmmm.",1
Wow!,1
"This girl will go far. This involves him selling out, and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity. This contradiction is never that much of an issue, because Simon Pegg ( as Sidney ) projects likability too well. The key word here is "" based "".",1
< br / > < br / > This 2008 picture works on account of its actors and the simple yet sharp story. Young wants the down right dirty contrasted with the American professionalism.,1
I know it's not a true story. One of Simon Pegg's best.,1
"Its one of these films where every little detail does pay tribute to a great piece of work. Yet it works so well, especially with Pegg in the front seat.",1
"Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real.",1
"Kirsten Dunst was good as the love interest. < br / > < br / > Along the way to success, he finds true meaning of love, etc.",1
Wow!,1
How can you not like him?! Simon Pegg is still hilarious as ever! Kirsten Dunst and Jeff Bridges were brilliant! Sidney finds creative ways to annoy nearly everyone. How to Lose Friends & Alienate People hit the spot!,1
"I rapidly became absorbed in the unfolding of the narrative and remained engrossed throughout. Pacing of the more visual humorous content was, I thought, spot on.",1
"If this film plays at festival near you, or on video, don't miss it!",1
"Things go from bad to worse, when Ariel's mother dies suddenly. Elsa, while surprised, wants to do the right thing. Although we liked it, we didn't think it was extraordinary. It's almost a miracle he gets the job.",1
"It's not my favorite movie but it is a movie I have enjoyed seeing more than once. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other. The ending scenes from Puccini's Turandot alone are worth the time to get there. """,1
Just enjoy!,1
"I'm Italian. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and voice is what it's all about. this is a god - awful movie. ).",1
What's not to like about this film?,1
I even bought several of his CD's. ! He will definitely be missed!,1
The film is a compilation of'80s kid's films conventions. It's so good it's difficult to put into words. One of director Miike Takashi's very best. Not for younger or more sensitive kids though. < br / > < br / > This ranks as one of the greatest children's films ever made. < br / > < br / > Just jaw - droppingly wonderful.,1
That's all it is. Despite This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans.,1
"I'm rambling here, I know.",1
"Babbette of gay Paris! "" ... in our household.",1
"no, i'm not 10.. i'm 30!",1
"I am 17 years old now. I still watch it. Mmm, yes a sequel indeed.",1
The Great Yokai War is Miike's attempt at a family film and damn fine job he does as well.,1
It continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are SIXTEEN of them. This is a very strange film by director / animator Richard Williams.,1
< br > < br / > Hope this helps.,1
"I didn't know it had been in a theater at all. Woo - hoo! 10 stars on here, it's still a great kids film. < br / > < br / > It's out there.",1
I mean how far did the Raggedy's walk anyway? Music : 10 - Nothing short of perfection here. Delightful surprises await the two adventurers. How will they escape the Kookoo king and his henchmen!? Acting : 8 - Every character suits their voice so well. Dolls that come to life when the master isn't around.,1
"What the heck? However, pirate Captain Contagious kidnaps her. Raggedy Ann and Andy set off to try to rescue her before Marcella discovers Babette is gone.",1
Ill never forget my experience watching it.,1
Highly recommended. I thought it was a great film. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark.,1
But after watching it again yesterday I've found it to be amazing.,1
Compelling and Innovative!,1
"This is one of the few films that is simply TO DIE FOR! ! The special effects are nothing less than breathtaking, and make any work by Spielberg look trite and elementary.",1
"< br / > < br / > 3. ) Almost every actor look like a layman. A little bit of Indian spirituality, mystic thriller and slasher movie mixed together. I saw it on DVD and was glad to could rewind to listen it again. The dialogs are sometimes on soap - opera - level.",1
8 / 10.,1
"Previous to this story we have seen Lars Eriksson and notably his wonky ( lazy? ) eye, we also see him healing or at least comforting a patient.",1
i'm waiting for second hit!,1
"Devi tells the tale of a young man who wants to "" jump out of his skin "". A good little find, this one, I'd give it 8 out of 10. This is probably the best of the three segments.",1
Reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participants. Things get quite bloody.,1
"but a great film none the less. Moms never really home. Where was this film when I was a kid? Tadashi's sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone. Hats off This a dark Grimms tale with humor. Now comes the hard part, trying to explain the film.",1
!,1
I have to say I'm pretty glad I did.,1
"I have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film Sommersault. Peaches is truly a marvelous film. Or more particularly does not want to get it. It fully deserved to win best picture. In conclusion if the film does not win all at this years AFI's and IF awards, then it is a rigged game. I see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety. Your average punter, I have found just does not write comments like that. This manipulation of the media is pretty common down under.",1
All made for TV.,1
"Who knows - maybe they did. However, the narrative structure point is debatable.",1
"However, the movie really didn't need explanation. I'm glad I saw it.",1
"Billed as Takashi Miike's "" first family film "" - by people who haven't seen Zebraman, presumably. Regardless, it's a great project for Miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into. ).",1
"We accept fully her ability by the film's end to find her place in world more confidently. Though without sight, she has insight.",1
"I can't say it is totally flawless, but it's near. You enjoy it while you watch it, and you take it home with you.",1
Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this film.,1
I always said that the animated Batman movies were much better than the live action films.,1
The music was alright.,1
"Freeze or Phantasm were ). < br / > < br / > Don't get me wrong, I did find movie enjoyable. But just remember, it's not as good as the other Batman animated movies.",1
!,1
The late John Vernon will be missed. Why? Kelly Ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects. Same thing goes for Robin.,1
And Batman is denying any affiliation with her. Batman : Mystery of the Batwoman was drawn and shot in 1. < br / > < br / > It's a shame the DVD isn't so great. 1 soundtrack but... the movie is presented in Pan and Scan.,1
"This is true in the Mystery of Batwoman. It has good storyline, universal appeal and even great acting to top it off. Also I think the fight with Bane should have been done better. 75 minutes is way too short for any movie.",1
"Bruce Wayne looks much like he has before, but now he appears somewhat less imposing. < br / > < br / > The score adds to the mysterious ambiance of movie. "" The revolution to the mystery is a delightfully sneaky twist. My all - time favorite, the Penguin, is here.",1
Capital City'fans rejoice!,1
I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. The show is less than an hour long.,1
"This point will return to dominate the last scene in the film. Myrtle and Letty testify that he was in the apartment when the fire was discovered. When this doesn't work, he resorts to the draconian tactic of staging an arson of his own office, for which Randy is blamed. He does, however, quickly form a useful friendship with Gabby.",1
"And, it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery. < br / > < br / > Once in town, Scott goes to this uncle about the job.",1
"That seemed rather odd to me, particularly since he was addressed as Jeff almost immediately into the story. Approximately eighteen at the time of this movie, he bears a passing resemblance to Sean Penn. I'm inclined to think not.",1
That includes not backing relatives up when they're villains. He even has the sheriff in his pocket. < br / > < br / > Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing. Hadn't been seen in years.,1
"< br / > < br / > This concept is used to expand Star Trek's possibility and enabling a kind of genre - mix. ). """,1
The settings are superb and almost movie like.,1
"The office itself is almost an exact replica of the one featured in Bogey's "" Maltese Falcon. "" Oh, well... He was such a handsome man back in 1940's.",1
Robert Culp. What a decade.,1
"Robert Culp ( they call his character "" doctor ""... ). Kudos for that. I think he's a vet or something ) and family move to an affluent, low - tax, zero - law - enforcement suburb. It doesn't make a big generational thing out of it.",1
"The cars are really great as well, as I recall. Remember, just because it's made - for - television doesn't mean it isn't great art.",1
"A very good actor.. I might add. This is a very good, made for TV film.",1
Why? I felt it all.,1
It's not a myth.,1
"WORTH EVERY PENNY! Besides, he is an incredibly Beautiful Man. Always with A - list actors but just not always a "" hit "". I really thought this wasn't that bad. Patricia Arquette was overacting much of the time. Really sexy.",1
"< br / > < br / > How dumb is that? The rest of the movie, however, leaves something to be desired.",1
"The woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot. Women that could act and who would totally arouse you? As plots go for this type of genre, not to bad. Even the title, "" Deviant Obsession "", sounds like a Hardcore flick. But everything else in the film seems cheap. But I want my soft - core and my hard - core separate.",1
THIS is the formula that they are using.,1
Nothing like it.,1
"Nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of Italian zombie - flicks, but honestly why would we bother? Recommended to fans ; don't mind the negative reviews. The undead birds were original, for example, and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well. This movie is comparable to Umberto Lenzi's "" Nightmare City "". Yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over - the - top gore compensates for everything!",1
"I give it an 8 / 10, just because of sheer enjoyment. Zombi 3 fits that bill, and then some.",1
This is no Dawn of the Dead folks. ? Oh the head in the fridge! < br / > < br / > The zombies come in all varieties. < br / > < br / > The gore is plentiful.,1
Also check out Zombi 4. How rad is that?,1
"4. Zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making. Zombie Birds. < br / > < br / > Overall, I actually liked this film.",1
I think the good over wins the bad.,1
10 out of 10. I tell you I couldn't sleep for weeks! And was was with the telekinesis? You'd think her parents would have been worried.,1
His opening scene is a classic. I love cartoons.,1
Some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming. The horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible. The sensitive ones get eaten.,1
They begin as enemies and end as best friend.,1
"8 / 10 I am not going to lie, this is a great movie.",1
The real letdown is the animation.,1
"I'm glad I gave it a chance. < br / > < br / > "" Bait "" ain't perfect. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.",1
The morale of the film shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end.,1
"Shrek, anyone? 7 / 10",1
"If you don't hate cute animals making funny things, watch it at least once. Even the "" evil "" is lovely, fluffy big cat with those funny teeth. [ Which means lots of work nevertheless! ]",1
Simply beautiful. Not Ice Age.,1
( spoilers?? ) Even for a sequel.,1
'every time it's getting intolerably dull.,1
Scrat is cool! Nothing was forced or over done.,1
"Usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster. He is so out of place, cracking bad jokes, evoking no sympathy from audience. ).",1
This is a good movie for kids. The worst part was the voice of Sid.,1
"Ice Age "" is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by Blue Sky Studios and released in 2002 as the company's first. Relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out, okay? He then pays toll with some aardvarks.",1
"Plus the Dodo scene, which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002. Finally I got to see the infamous "" Ice Age "".",1
( unless you are very severe! ) The mother dies but Manfred and Sid decides to take him and return the baby for the humans.,1
There parents also seemed engaged. ! Personally I liked the Scrat!,1
"Just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially nice looking film.",1
"I was only 13 at the time, but even then I liked it. They are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch. It had some sort of warmth.",1
"< br / > < br / > Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek. You know the outcome, but you can't help being drawn in.",1
And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd.,1
Gomez has something to do with this.,1
"Rating, 7. Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway to notice her, but he just gets annoyed with her antics.",1
Judy Garland ( enough said! ) < br / > < br / > 2.,1
It's the best scene in the film as Gilchrist encourages Judy to keep at it. She did a couple of films with MGM and then went back to Europe for more work on the continent.,1
< br / > < br / > Another point i didn't like was on opening night. Well in this film she looks perfect.,1
"But Fleming was a man of all business, he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it. We'd get to see a lot more of a man who became a move legend. He did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name. Probably because they were done in black and white. Had he lived he might have become a name like Eastwood's. What a pity. < br / > < br / > Rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it.",1
imdb. < br / > < br / > I look forward to every episode ; I'm collecting the whole set.,1
"The last new episode aired in November, 1965.",1
Focusing on a band of trail drovers lead by the trail boss Gil Favor. We shall not see his like again. Rawhide was a wonderful TV western series. All of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history.,1
"Excellente! It's done in a mature artistic manner. As they'd say in espanol, "" Es muy muy bien!!! "" The film also has some amazing costumes.",1
"< br / > < br / > "" Erendira "" is gorgeous.",1
"This story is universal. Well, I'll be looking to buy a copy now. Liked movie?",1
I was not disappointed. The movie is about a lot of things.,1
"< br / > < br / > Hopefully you will see the film in its Spanish language version, with subtitles. I first rented this film many years ago, and was completely enthralled by it.",1
and go at it.,1
It has all the characteristics of one.,1
Only for fans of truly bad slasher flick. ).,1
"Good, trashy fun. Alan Pudney's slick cinematography does the trick.",1
< br / > < br / > I love the story. It's like Tamara ( 2005 ). I really sympathize with Marty. Good cheesy slasher!,1
"It could have been left off, or thought out better. I've never seen another movie like this one, well, not horror anyway. But... they are the only ones receiving them!",1
"Well, it doesn't pretend to.",1
"For soon, they will die, of course.",1
She almost got out the first time. I wonder if it's because of the part he played in the movie. The lab blows up disfiguring him badly.,1
"The coach puts a stop to it, but both parties swear revenge. But, the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive. and then is killed instantly. ).",1
"Years later & the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school, they all arrive to discover they are the only ones there. Basically it delivers what it promises, homicidal killer, blood, boobs & babes.",1
That's why you're here anyway. That jester hat ( or was it a mask? ) No. Classic crap all the way. gets electrocuted.,1
"I for one don't. The last prank ended tragically. it is a horror slasher. More importantly, why is there a bathtub in a school bathroom. The ending.... there is a twist. One of them set it up at the old high school.",1
He looked like a teenager. IMDb.,1
"YES, the plot is hardly plausible and very thin. YES, it has been done so many times before.",1
They're a bunch of sociopaths. The ending makes little or no sense.,1
That's all it is. Especially this film. It isn't the 80's anymore. God Bless 80's slasher films.,1
"""'s theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending. A serious comedy.",1
I highly recommend this movie.,1
"Sad. This woman was lonely since the death of her husband. To prevent that, she bought it.",1
"Still, what was there was interesting.",1
I had nowhere to go.,1
).,1
10 / 10 definitely!,1
It is not a simple right or wrong. Put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show.,1
"Don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre, people. And for an Action / Comedy, it was very well done. < br / > < br / > etc.",1
< br / > < br / > Edward Burtynsky is the name of photographer. It isn't made clear.,1
"Overall, this is what kept me so interested in the movie.",1
"< br / > < br / > When it comes to the story, I don't see anything quite bad about it. All of what you see was the desired effect. Basically, I personally loved cast and characters.",1
I also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories. When I rented Domino I was expected it to be very dumb.,1
* Kiera Knightly alludes to Domino Harvey's sexuality her interview with Lucy Liu.,1
Domino is a great movie. The script is good. Delroy Lindoi gives a good supporting performance. The action scenes are exhilarating.,1
"So, this stomped me a bit. This movie portrays a difficult life.",1
I doubt much of this film is based on a true story. They let her join the group.,1
"To me, Foxx is an original.",1
I think Tony Scott made a good movie here.,1

Jenna Jameson did it again! Oh yeah!,1
"Loved that scene with icicles, absolute classics potential. This one is quite a nice surprise. < br / > < br / > 9 / 10 including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect. An unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle imitation.",1
Morse ends up coming down hard on Hutchinson. Overall it was pretty good movie.,1
"Also, I'd like to see more attempts like this one.",1
"The actors of this movie done really good acting, they all done a great job. The great Jenna Jameson doesn't do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of. Dreamquest is definitely raised bar of quality of adult movies.",1

And it was touching. I am not sure how I feel about the ending. This was a great role for him.,1
"The young Hagar is played by Christine Horne who is exceptional in her first feature role. Despite Hagar's pleading, her relationship with Bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot. This is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of Manawaka, condemning the young couple to a life of poverty. As she nears the end of her days, she reflects that "" pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear.",1
The loss seemed stronger. She WAS Hagar through and through.,1
"I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon. This movie is about basically human relations, and the interaction between them.",1
I can only blame its current lowish rating of 6.,1
Great film!,1

Even my ex - girlfriend said this movie questionable. That should count for something. Even laughing quite a bit. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. The fanboy mentality strikes again. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Bait is one of most underrated movies of 2000 period.,1
"Even if you can't track down the video, the soundtrack is worth it too.",1
"Adaptation of Pat Barker's novel "" Union Street "" ( a better title! )",1

"< br / > < br / > I was disappointed this movie. But, don't forget it was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself. I just don't know. Just exactly who was the chef in love with? He never convinced me he was in love with the princess.",0
Otherwise this was a ripoff of Bergman. The loooonnnnng shots were too long. And i'm no fan f his either.,0
But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman. When I was little my parents took me along to the theater to see Interiors. The film is painfully slow and dull.,0
I would have to agree with.,0
"Woody's rarely made a funnier movie. "" That was an old poem. Oh.",0
It didn't work. Unless you are true Harrelson fan. The film is bad. I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 70's. It is painful!,0
"This film is one giant pant load. But, his is not the worst accent in the movie. It is monotonous. This movie is not worth your time. That's kind of good reason to cast someone else don't ya think?",0

Kareena Kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm.,0
"Otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully. I rented this on DVD and I kind of feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so earnest about it in the DVD comments. Plus, it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways, and the characters'behavior often strains belief.",0
But how could he okay a role like this? Why? Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot.,0
""".",0
"It was entertaining, but it was fundamentally weak. 9 % of the screens dedicated to screening it. < br / > < br / > After watching it, I knew why. When I watched Jodha Akbar, it was a full house, but it wasn't for Tashan.",0
Saif Ali Khan - completely disappointed in your choice of film. Shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to. Anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for English.,0
But it is not slick.,0
The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshay's love story. An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar. That itself was a clear indicator of the director's vision. After the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music.,0
"< br / > < br / > Thats all. And for that, I give rating of 2 out of 10. It reminded me of some of the early 80's movies.",0
It is hilarious. The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar.,0
But this cannot be said for Anil Kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain. Yes! I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a Yashraj Film.,0
Race was hot on heels and that is a million times better.,0
Yaaawwnnn...,0
And last but not the least about Kareena. ! Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie. But he has fully developed himself in the acting field.,0
Kareena's beauty and a couple of songs may be. All the action scenes I wish I could have forwarded. I just saw the movie in theater. But in Bollywood this is certainly not going to work. Thats it. The movie has very few good points to talk about. I think Bollywood now should forget about the action movies. They cant make it.,0
Said Ali khan was alright. The storyline was okay. CRAP.,0
"Everything was terrible from the start. Good Luck next time. Even the storyline was weightless. But, Hindi cinema's signature are songs. They tend to exaggerate way too much.",0

Susannah York was hardly a slouch.,0

"The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones ( although not very far ) is that the sexual content is not glorified. There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second is it ever sexy.

I've seen the Gator Bait films, and this is almost exactly the same thing as those. < br / > < br / > The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks.

The naked ladies tend to look great, and if it wasn't for them, this film would get very boring very quickly. There's nothing to recommend this film for really ; but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks, you might find some enjoyment here. However, the way that it executes this idea isn't original in the slightest ; we follow a bunch of kids that, for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest.

So far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie I've seen was Juno. So far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message. Though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through. Then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does. As figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new.,0

It is a technically adept film.,0
Ouch!,0
It is not that well - known. Ergo : The moon - landings where not fake.,0

This is about point that Haim's career tanked. This is one of them.,0
Not how I'd imagined Tarzan would look. There was some guy with a guitar there.,0
"To me, his character is unnecessary to the film's plot. There are a few things that derail this film. < br / > < br / > First, Tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals. The finale of the Weissmuller Tarzan movies is a rather weak one.",0
Faster than you can say'Is this a dumb plot or WHAT?,0
Just an sketchy idea of a plot. A dozen times. be warned : this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence.,0
Who's killer?,0
"Now, get ready for : The Safety Pin Killer! You got it, shots of the women working out. It is an odd choice to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. < br / > < br / > What happened next? You know Jason, you know Freddy, and you know Leatherface. Not even end of the movie can stop them!",0
It's a slasher but without suspense.,0
"What a wasted opportunity! Several years later people turn up dead in the same spa. Aerobicide "" ( a. k. a. """,0

Run away! ).,0
Anyway this film fell so flat for me that I didn't finish it. These have both been shown on Turner Classic Movies channel.,0
Also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this. Again better direction was needed. The plot itself wasn't that bad. They are just glorified extra's. Too bad the director left her hanging. Avoid!,0
"< br / > < br / > And indeed, it does.",0

This one doesn't. Cringe - inducing dialogue at places.,0
This movie sucked.,0
Good Day.,0
The make up is so bad it's worth mentioning. What happened to her? Wasn't Archer once a decent actress?,0
I think film needed more work. Was it rushed? Just flashes.,0

What a waste of effort. A poor choice indeed. Doh!,0

The transitions get lost.,0

"Not one of her best flicks, to put it mildly. Sometimes I think I'm going out of my mind, "" she tells her husband.",0
"By the final tear soaked scene, I had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters.",0
I don't know what do YOU think about this film? And I couldn't have been more agree about it.,0
"This scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson # 3. Lesson # 3 : Thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only, but always as an end in itself. The wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished.",0
That's fine. My biggest complaint comes with the ending.,0
The ENDING is really creepy and yet almost comical. Mostly amusing. He is a good actor. ). It really is hilarious in a sick way.,0

"Frankly, this is a terribly dated and practically impossible film to watch.",0
( Plummer especially!,0
!,0
Wow and I thought that any Steven Segal movie was bad.,0
Nothing else needs to be said. Probably one of the worst scripts ever made. Where to start?,0
And Dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles.,0
It wasn't.,0
A pity.,0
This movie is utterly terrible. It's awful and it's the lowest point in Lundgren's career.,0
"Dolph Lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else. The Minion is about... well, a minion. An archeologist is assigned to study / dig the place where the key was found. We are merely to accept that they just exist. Anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage. < br / > < br / > The verdict : 2 of 5 stars.",0
What is up with that.,0
"What happened? Actually, it never really got going.",0
"A lacklustre cast, mundane script and vague, caricature characters ensure that Baby Mama certainly isn't taxing on the ol'noggin, but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour.",0
Wait.,0
Baby Mama's ending was unfunny and dull. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. But this isn't there best. Baby Mama had a great supporting cast. Even laugh out loud funny.,0
Also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken. They are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride home. It all screams set - up! Personally I can't do that with a drama and found this too far - fetched. ).,0
"Wow, love plot.",0
It put me to sleep! Still this movie is pretty bad.,0
"Storm Sylvia and his men run into this desert - like princess Simira, Ziva Rodann. Storm can get there to stop them. On the way there Capt. This action on Robert's and Dr. Farrady's part has Numar faint dead in his tracks.",0
"The cast helps very little. Not a good rating to be sure, but generous given all the problems I have with the movie.",0
I was amazed to hear that.,0
The worst movie I have seen in quite a while.,0
"atmosphere, I rented it.",0
"! First 30 minutes you actually enjoy it! OK. Film starts with 3 people meeting each other in the bar. But, God, No!!!",0

That's the best part.,0
"It's not the greatest film of 2005, nor is it complete garbage. It just has a lot of problems. Then the movie starts slowing down. Much more rewarding post - Soviet stuff. Nice sound, sure.",0
It is very long.,0
squalid.,0
"Everything is supposed to be funny, but it isn't.",0
I can't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie! Don't waste your time here!,0
Charlie and Mabel argued bitterly during the making of this film.,0
"i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago. i mean, i'm pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion. the acting was atrocious. what a disaster. LOL.",0
"I just can't recommend this one. Well, that is not true...",0
"I wonder what Freud's theory would be on that! Gnaw : Food of Gods 2 "" is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch! Go nuts!",0
If you like crap films you'll get some fun out of this one.,0
Nothing to say but Wow! Has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field?,0
Was that the only mask they could find? 3. The last but certainly the least was the acting. Not scary whatsoever. Apparently she hangs out with special kids. They actually have trees there.,0
I missed the really botched ending.,0
"The resolution and quality are poor. Everyone was believable and really looked the part. The whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost. Their acting was also above average. < br / > < br / > To this show's credit, the casting was nearly perfect. com.",0
Or was that the point? It was not very artistic. I want a refund... Can I have my $ 16 back?,0

YOu figure it out long before these genius characters do.,0
"For many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature. for the duration of movie. Case in point, I Robot. When the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest.",0
"What this film really is, is... depressing.",0
"And if you can destroy robots by smashing them, why do they need to inject'nanites '?",0

Some pretty actress? I don't know.,0
"! In the movie version, Boone's presence is nothing except underwhelming. B. Guthrie.",0
"""? The actors always seem to be fidgetting.",0
"Maybe he needed the money. This movie makes Canadians and Brits out to be asinine, moronic idiots. Not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower!",0
Even movie's musical number ( which had been Disney's specialty for years ) stunk. House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young.,0
"Maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic. Lo and behold, I spied Wes Craven's name in the credits as an electrical gaffer.",0
This... this... is NOT even that good.,0
Now that's entertainment. It's none of above.,0
The jokes were not funny.,0
"I found this film to be an utter dissapointment. Julia Roberts is feeble, Zeta - Jones is just plain annoying ( appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity, minus the humour ), Crystal just plays his same old hyper - active, neurotic, annoying alter - ego and Cusack simply walks through his part, apparently bored with the whole project. Pure genius.",0
The chemistry between the leading characters is non - existent. Writing is trivial.,0
who gets the guy. for short. in the first hour or so nothing really happens.,0
This is not a lie.,0
"Wow, what a great cast! A script, you say?",0
I felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore - fest.,0
"Too little, too late. Unfortunately, that theme wasn't explored to it's full potential.",0
Not on your life. How about as a romantic comedy? And I mean ultra light.,0
I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique.,0
"< br / > < br / > However, the acting is near perfect.",0
Jeez!,0
i hate it.,0
"Plus, promised rock and roll just didn't move me.",0
I'm not even gonna go on. But don't expect anything spectacular.,0
So is there a camp factor to the movie?,0
It's fun to mock. < br / > < br / > A horrible example of film.,0
"It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank. I mean, it was deplorable. I feel like I'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by Branagh's performance. I second that notion.",0

I don't know. Come on. What was the plot? It made no sense whatsoever. A genie who raps?,0
I was wrong.,0
"I honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time. Hell, even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this movie would still be a joke.",0
"prove that any idea, no matter how dumb, can make it to the big screen! "".",0
The movie did not disappoint.,0
I would give this zero but that is impossible.,0
And what the hell is a djin?,0
At least with the movie it's over soon.,0
It is so horrible it is not even funny. Shaq better just stick to basketball.,0
What a pathetic movie.,0
The development of Jane's childhood and character were exceptional.,0
Wrong!!!,0
"But then again, nah.",0
"In addition, his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes. So much of the novel had been left out and I considered William Hurt to be terribly miscast as Rochester. We know that they are supposed to fall in love, but we never see it actually happen.",0
"Given a better scripting, perhaps the film would have been more successful.",0
It has been about 24years since I read the book as it was in school. ! I love it so much I watch it regularly.,0
Because he was THINKING WITH HIS LITTLE HEAD!,0
mini series with Timothy Dalton. What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking?,0
"No, back to the BBC - version.",0
This movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book.,0
There is no comparison. She would have been better - cast as Mrs Fairfax. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all. < br / > < br / > There is no mystery surrounding the story of Rochester's first wife.,0
"This version is pretty insipid, I'm afraid.",0
The original Jane Eyre was a hero.,0
"He just doesn't have it in him. Sure enough, MASSIVE FAILURE! I don't know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker.",0
This film took itself way too seriously and just didn't know when to end. Neither does the uneven level of performances. Her credibility exceeded all others by far.,0
"There's some high calibre actors fair enough, and none turns in an average or worse performance. Yadda yadda yadda. < br / > < br / >'Magnolia'is poor, and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed. The bit with the frogs is good though. That's not just my considered verdict on this film, but also on the bulk of what has been written about it.",0
But the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display.,0
What is it about?,0
So go figure. Once.,0
The biggest kick in pants was the ending frog scene. I wanted to like Magnolia.,0
Sorry did i miss something? did i walk out early?,0
Great cast. This is a waste of time.,0
But it all adds up to nothing. Where is the reason to care for these people?,0
Kansas City? < br / > < br / > A big bore.,0
But missable. Not worst of TV movies.,0
"< br / > < br / > What bothered me was how Spelling's role is distorted. It also had a decent script. If Farrah isn't really "" serious "" about a career, why does she have a manager ( and why is he wasting his time )? He's shown as the show - runner and creator when he was neither.",0
"Harlow never explains about the witness'accusing her of murder and her panic! And that's a shame. The casting is strange, also. This is no gem - not even semi - precious. It simply doesn't come together like it should.",0
"I actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running. The gore content is, quite frankly, laughable. Once that's out of the way though, it is all downhill. Each of the substories is more formulaic than the last, and the sets get worse and worse as movie runs.",0
The movie was bad but I've seen worse. It SURPRISINGLY had a plot!,0
Almost two hours is way too long.,0
"Or Scorsese. < br / > < br / > I was wrong. As for the often mistimed use of Cradle Of Filth's score... man, they should sue. By all accounts, this could have been an interesting film. It sounds BAD. Give me Bruce Campbell any day.",0
To me this movie seemed like 80. That was really it.,0
"I give it a 2 out of 10. In this case, it was a big miss.",0
< br / > < br / > Now on to the cons. This movie has a few things going for it right off the bat. There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie.,0
"He delivers. Yeah, exactly. I left it on the shelf. Well I guess he's just very, very bad. Why?",0
Very well done.,0
"The acting performances are a joke and some of the worst I've ever seen. ... and you can look at that statement in different ways, by the way. !",0
This is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slack - jacked uttering that sense of whoa.,0
"< br / > < br / > But still. This sure is one comedy I'm not likely to forget for a while. Oh, that and two or three pairs of breasts. The lesson : Watch out, naughty boys and girls, because one day you'll be made to pay for what you've done.",0
"Don't waste your money. This movie seriously bites, big time.",0
"I cannot understand why Robert Altman would take this job. Or, in the case of Downey's & Hannah's characters, apparently superfluous. Surely he has some power to pick and chose.",0
This was a disappointing film for me.,0
"Take the lead actor, Lee J. Cobb.",0
Never mind the rest of script and sloppy direction. A complete anti - talent. I watched like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me. No way.,0
Oh my how wrong I was!,0

"< br / > < br / > Branagh plays MacGruder with a mealy and unconvincing Southern accent. But that's only part of the problem. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man is Altman at his worst, even if the pay is the same. With red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way. The female leads ( Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen ) are lean leggy and unemotive.",0
One such lady Cleo ( Geneva Mitchell ) turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women. Rogers isn't that good either.,0

What a turd. !,0
Earned itself a score 1.,0
"Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with the guns. < br / > < br / > Overall, this movie is crap.",0
"It sure didn't appeal to me. I like what Boozer does to Clarissa in the end. She still looks hot, though. It was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film. It had nowhere to go but down.",0
"To be honest, I've had more fun in a dentist. More's the pity because this frankly dreadful "" horror "" is about as scary as a box of kittens. Will any of them survive and more importantly, haven't you got better things to worry about? There are a couple of problems here. But you'll never guess what happens next?",0
"Those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more, but for me it wasn't a good time. I just watched The Convent for the second time. I was saddened to find that I could no longer appreciate it much.",0

I suppose that this is a horror / comedy. The special - effects were not so special.,0
Rarely have I witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent.,0
"As for a story, forget it.",0
"There's always a silver lining, kids.",0

"( Overstatement? I don't recommend this movie. However, this dud seemed to last forever. The ending is quaint but doesn't salvage the rest of this quagmire / tourist trap of a rental. Probably. )",0
It becomes a cliche. WRONG! NOTHING in this movie is funny.,0
the bit where the old men when to capture Robert Duvall was ludicrous.,0
"Obviously that must be the secret. Here, he plays Sgt. I had the volume turned up.",0
I am not a big fun of Rob Schneider. The doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him.,0
"My favorite scene... just does not exist. That formula never gets old, does it?",0

I wonder why? But that would have ended the story. The Germans were portrayed as incompetents and the Russians as heroes.,0
Having seen AAA for over 1000 times I noticed that straight away. 2. I know it has many fans that swear by it but I didn't like it one bit.,0
You don't get really either of these in the video. Dreary. The acting isn't even properly campy and the dialog is the pits. Just plain dreadful and awful.,0

It was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie. It doesn't. I got this movie in the $ 5 bin at walmart. I would not recommend watching this move. It's just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another.,0
And thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust. I'd give it three Oscars for stupidity.,0

This movie is far from a classic. Now I've seen Dillinger and I've had it. Someone called it brilliant. John Dillinger was killed before both of them. Pierpont wasn't shot. I just recently reviewed Baby Face Nelson. First of all he looks nothing like him.,0
This movie was horribly inaccurate. The way his gang members died were fictitious. The action was overdone as well.,0
Proof why Hollywood conventions are in place.,0

"The movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least. We all understood by the end. look like Citizen Kane. This movie makes "" Dude, Where's My Car?

The cuts, the graininess, and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience.",0

"I blame director and writer Kerry Conran. There were some "" wow "" and exciting scenes. Rating 4 / 10 Sky Captain!!! The film just doesn't have that hook to really make it memorable. Her performance is surprisingly bland as well. There just weren't enough of them. < br / > < br / > The movie is not a complete bust though. It's simply just another case of style over substance.",0

"A cult hit it might become, but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve. First off, let me state right off the bat that I sincerely doubt that Paramount will ever recover any money from this film. An infant could notice that a car doesn't glide along the road like a maglev train ( unless its a Mercedes S500 ). Quite simply, the graphics are amazingly poor. So there you have it. ! After all, why shock and awe with one floating airship when you can have three, or five, or one hundred? I can see the studio pitch now.

"No special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make - up. A little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside. They all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school. The premise of the film has a new young lady coming to Rosalie to take care of her.

"I recommend this to huge fans of the series only. The acting is mostly unimpressive. The first Home Alone was a decent enough film... the sequel was pretty much the same, at a new setting.

The special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period.,0

"But, no.",0

Atkins was one of those featured. Avoid. Not even so bad it's fun.,0

But let's try anyway. Destroy it on sight!,0
The killings are hilarious.,0
Why would you?,0
"Oh come on! A killer snow man? Groaning, stupid, and bad. Well I was wrong, very wrong. The acting for one is appalling!",0
Sounds scary. I saw it on cable and I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it. Interesting plot. I'm sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere.,0
Boy this movie had me fooled. The POV camera angles were awesome.,0
And as usual it comes from Stewart. What an actor. So perfection isn't everything.,0
Oops!,0
"In doing so, Jack Frost ends up killing half town. A movie to pass the time away. This alone makes it worth watching for a laugh.",0
Mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead. This is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not. < br / > < br / > Avoid.,0

It made me want to throw up and get my time back... at least I didn't have to pay for this garbage. < br / > < br / > I had to watch this for a class. Practically every shot is canted, but so what?! BE WARNED.",0
You MUST be kidding!!!! There's more wood in this film than a toothpick factory.,0
"How, then, is he left? And that's just the plot. < br / > < br / > As for the other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool ( or is it Grim?",0
Never mind a decent story. But it's really this ridiculous ride. It's rotten. Long live Henry Fool.,0
"The movie is much too long at 158 minutes. This is a low - budget spoof of the espionage genre. ( 3 ) Shots are frequently framed in off - balance angles, poking fun at genre excesses. The film's impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy.",0
Then there's the sticky question of the characters'ages. ).,0
"< br / > < br / > Quite simply, the direction just sucks.",0
A huge disappointment. I am baffled. !,0
This movie sucks ass. That sucks. MYSTERY MEN.,0
! What an appalling piece of rubbish!!,0
Much like the two hours plus I spent in that theatre. Forever.,0
Indeed.,0
There are many films that do this far better.,0
And this is why this film is truly despicable. suburbs. Hundstage was a truly awful experience. But this isn't social criticism.,0
"I shut this movie off 45 minutes in, which is 30 minutes more than I actually should have. This isn't a characterization of unknown or a clever observation into the dregs of society, it's just boring and nothing worth caring about. I wasn't interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism.",0
Or you could say : the hell is on this world.,0
I hated it but I felt compelled to see it through.,0
There isn't one.,0
That there are many crazy lunatics around us? So.......... so what?,0
I am a Bakhtiari.,0
This in my opinion is of least quality. < br / > < br / > Best skip this and watch the two originals.,0

Not much really happens in this movie.,0
"This is the only reason I gave the film a 3. They yell at each other and swear crassly. """,0

Might as well try to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro.,0
BUT NO! Disgusting.,0
"So you decide. Night of Twister "" has the latter.",0
I live in Nebraska. This was a real event.,0
Mediocre at absolute best.,0
NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is a case in point.,0

"Well, Mrs. Geisel, that makes one of us. That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more... well, Grinchy.",0
"They actually just destroyed the story, period. It just didn't make any sense to me. I mean he's a great comedic actor, but him as the Grinch? Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable.",0
"I don't think so - - at least not for thinking adults. Commander Rourke loses nothing being voiced by James Garner. The characters are weak. Aside from landscapes, buildings and vehicles there isn't much to impress.",0
Norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2. It doesn't fit. We see prejudiced whites being stood up to by Paul because of his native American girl.,0
I don't think so - - at least not for thinking adults. The characters are weak.,0
I went to see this one with much expectation.,0
"Is it in the Atlantic? And WHY did Atlantis sink? "" Who knows?",0
The animation is dark and dreary and cheap. It's the creative highlight of the movie. Problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea.,0
"If so, "" my bad. "" Robert De Niro salutes indoors, uncovered. He stutters and is held in contempt by the others in his class. A ship is called a boat.",0

Isn't that amazing? Please!,0
At least it sets a mood. Go figure.,0
it was a big let down.,0
Where to begin.,0
Camera work is good.,0
Wow.,0
The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel. The story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch.,0
"once you watch the movie, you'll know what i mean. better than this movie deserves. it just wasn't necessary at all. in fact they look kinda cheap. it's also slow and fairly predictable.",0

"Most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments.

It's all very funny, though I am not sure that was the scene's purpose. As I said, it has a definite made directly to video look about it. The film is filled with lots of corpses and blood.",0

That's what is looked like they were doing. There was also a random allusion to 9 / 11 for no reason. I don't know why. com.,0

"Awful, awful, awful.",0

it made him look like Jim Varney.,0
"On the small screen, it's just another version of Law and Order spin - offs. The directing doesn't get in the way. This is the first problem with the TV remake - - color changes the tone of the story. At the end of the TV version, we are left with the feeling : "" Ho hum, who cares? """,0

The hitchiker scene served no purpose. The opening ( 2001 ) ran WAAAAAAAAAY too long. Some skits were just retarded. No problem.,0

I recently watched it again just to remind me why.,0

"It was almost painful. < br / > < br His character was jumpy, unrealistic and rather annoying. < br / > < br / > Rainn Wilson's performance is also far from "" hot "". They nearly throw the bed through wall because of Uma Thurman's "" passion "" let's say.",0
Fairly lame special effects.,0
It is a total waste of money and you'll only end up being disappointed afterwards. This film heavily relied on its special effects... but they personally had no effect on me. I honestly wished id never watched it and I strongly warn everyone against seeing this film.,0

"It came alive. But I am very, very nervous.",0
I want science fiction.,0
The actors?,0
This prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it. No surprise there! These kids are definitely not from this planet. The virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous & unbelievable. Caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror film.,0

Tom Cruise was never close to being this far gone. Not even close.,0
C - The brief fights look good. I kept waiting for things to make sense. The rest of the film does not. It's all quirky often bordering on bizarre. Joan Cusack just screams and whines and wigs out. Pathetic.,0

That would prove to be a much more pleasurable experience than sitting through this garbage. Here we have a movie which fails in pretty much every way it is possible for a movie to fail. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would very much like to pretend this movie never happened.,0

"< br / > < br / > One can only wonder what this was like on Broadway in 1938. And even if Jeanette's close - ups still glow with her gossamer beauty, this film is jaw - droppingly bad. Can't recommend it, even for fans of MacDonald and Eddy.",0
"I had to force myself to stick with it. I wanted to see more of her real character. Completely wrong for her operatic voice. Eddy stays "" asleep "" for the entire rest of movie, so it's all a dream.",0

I'm sorry but this is just awful.,0
NOTHING is explained. His wife is suddenly pregnant. WHY was the serial killer killing people? He's never seen again. We only see the one old man murdered. Who knows?? The baby sister? Some 105 year old woman lived there.,0

Which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute America's men in uniform.

We see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there's no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured.

"There isn't much of an arc to this story. All shot in a gray cold color. Stay away from this garbage. What this movie doesn't have is any drama, really. Unfortunately, the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage. And that I have to reject.",0
Who is responsible for this?,0
"I've heard her re - tell them many times. The acting was terrible and I couldn't even bear to watch it. < br / > < br / > Dennis Raider never had long hair. No. Same goes for his killings, as far as we all know.",0
Go figure. Don't see this movie.,0
Weird cuts and edits. No continuity to the plot.,0
It's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie. I lost.,0

This is NOT retelling. This isn't even about the BTK killer.,0
If I could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten. Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one.,0

The tone isn't funny or comical. ).,0
"Yeah like that could really happen. First off, the whole setup is incredibly contrived.",0

"Oh dear. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, The Office, etc so I was expecting great things. ), the clunky script ( a murderer of love?

I had a really hard time accepting this.,0
"I personally like it, but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone.",0
"4 / 10 Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. The highlight of this movie for me was without doubt Tom Hanks. Even so, he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings. It becomes a weird sort of father / son bonding movie. So Hanks took a role I wouldn't have expected him in, and he pulled it off well.",0
This is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing.,0
!,0
Gen is a total disappointment. hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big industry! those are not the only weak parts of the movie.,0
It could have been very scary indeed. I am sure he will improve. Actings are okay. Now everybody suspects from each other. I really like the beginning of the movie. There is no way out!!,0
"In The movie, it's like all good guys died without a reason.",0
WORST MOVIE EVER! 5 ) The sounds in the movie are off sync. What the heck is wrong with this movie. WTF? This is overall the worst movie.,0
"And in the end, you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary. Maybe I'm the only one, but it strained my eyes. < br / > < br / > The white balance seemed off throughout most of the film. Similar to Unleashed ( which was great, ) Dog Bite Dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master's bidding.",0
"Even at the end of the movie, Lee manages to get stabbed to death and fails once again. Soon after this scene, he has a similar situation at a dim sum restaurant. Not only is he uneducated, he is starving.",0
Wow! Oh well.,0
"All they have to go on is a photo of a young girl standing by an ornate music box. It did. I also lost count of how many times they say "" Budapest "" to each other.",0
The love scenes were forced and mechanical.,0
"In my opinion, a waste time.",0
"Sadly, the film lived down to its title.",0
"When it showed up in our mailbox, I threw it straight into the DVD player. CU just leaves you hanging. I might even be wrong saying this, it was that confusing.",0

Do we need to know? The plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome. His culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script. < br / > < br / > The plot is weak and trite.,0
"< br / > < br / > Sadly, even the gorgeous music of Pavarotti couldn't save this film. This is definitely overstating it as well. Wow, talk about romantic dialog!! Giving this a 10 is akin to giving Wally Cox the award for Mr. Universe or putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre!!!",0
< br / > < br / > Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy. It's just that this movie stinks.,0
"From there, craziness ensues. I liked the camel's song. Then, there was Sir Leonard. She definitely didn't help the movie.",0
"It tries also to be a musical. Is it a mind - blower? I hadn't heard of this film until I read an article about it on the Unknown Movies website, which made me curious. They're the stars of the show, yet they have no personalities.",0

Seriously. Even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable.,0
"I'm 24 now if you want to do the math. Screw you Whoopie, just be glad people only acknowledge Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst you lucky stiff. I must say that during my childhood I'm quite proud of a lot of the movies I've rented. The exception being Theodore Rex. After that that agent must have referenced Star Wars a lot.",0

"But it does. I hate this movie so very, very much.",0
< br / > < br / > This movie never knew what it wanted to be. Nothing ever works here. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. Wow!,0
I didn't see that when I watched this movie. Whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful. The humor is on that level and Theodore Rex looks like the inbred cousin of Barney. Utterly painful from start to finish.,0
Never.,0
< br / > < br / > And however did it get made? Poor Whoopi Goldberg.,0
NO STARS from * * * * From the What Was She Thinking?,0

There's no arguing here. The jokes are also completely lame. This... End of story. That's how bad it is.,0
Seriously. But Whoopi AND dinosaurs?,0
"There is a reason for this. I'd ask "" what were they THINKING? "" and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money to commit it to film. Let's remake'Blade Runner'with Barney in the Harrison Ford Role! "" Even the disturbing "" Dance!",0
"The gore factor is superb, however.",0
"And though blood sacrifice is given to Kali and Durga, the events depicted in this film are just absurd. The Mother is the embodiment of the physical Universe as well, she is Nature. Nature can be cruel and destructive to maintain balance.",0

"Batman Mystery of the Batwoman, is, in a word, stale.",0
Boy do I regret that. < br / > < br / > 2.,0
My feeling was this was filmed in a day - - please tell me it was. ).,0
All the production values scream that it's a low budget splatter flick from the very early part of that decade. I watched this immediately after seeing HILLSIDE CANNIBALS so anything would have been an improvement. On top of that it stops me from comparing ZOMBI 3 to 28 DAYS LATER and its sequel.,0
It's really bad.,0
You see Fulci himself didn't really have his heart and soul on this flick. Confused yet? He was disenchanted with it. So Zombie 3 was born.,0
"This, of course, makes it all the more fun. That said, Zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst films I have ever seen. Zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? I can't believe it's gotten so high a rating here. His scenes with the General were just hysterical.",0
"As a zombie movie, it blows. It is also not overrated.",0
"For the record, this film is intriguing but its hardly original. The highlight of the movie was Amanda's beautiful breasts in the hot - top scene. Somewhat of ripoff but not a total waste of time.",0
"So if Zombie Flesh Eaters was Fulci's Dawn, then is 2 his Day of the Dead? In the UK, the original Zombi film ( that is, Zombi 2 ) was titled "" Zombie Flesh Eaters "". Combining this last element with MOR 80s rock is not a good idea. ( Are you following all this? ) This is obviously not a good thing. In 1979 Lucio Fulci released his film Zombi.",0
"Unfortunately, the previews were the best thing about this movie. ).",0
!,0
"The scenes of zombie birds attacking people are not only technically inept but the whole idea is just absurd. The script by Fragasso is an absolute mess, none of it is well thought out & is just as stupid as it gets. ).",0
It'going to stay in my collection as fulci's zombie swan song.,0
"< br / > < br / > This is no doubt for hardcore Zombie action fans, especially of the Italian kind. The sound is also terrific. It's accidental genius of the highest order. The gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx.",0
"I feasted my eyes on a floating head that was never explained. This was a different kind of enjoyment. Hell, what else is there to do when youre dead? Where do I begin?",0
It's just that funny.,0

"Still, Zombi 3 is a baaad movie. Why?",0
"By the way, don't you think he's a little old for her?? ? Daraar got off to a pretty good start.",0
"The leader yells, "" Go get'em! "" Ohhh man! Instant classic!",0
"I am an avid fan of Lucio Fulci, and yet I must say that "" Zombi 3 "" ( aka. "" Zombie Felsh Eaters "" / "" Zombie "" ) of 1979, this is vastly disappointing. I am The film is sometimes fun to watch, but only for the gore, and as an unintentional comedy. Not that the film was a complete disaster. Sadly, that's about it.",0
"Cardboard characters. Plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lovers. Good job on the make - up effects. Lots of blood and some decent gore. It was a big success in Europe and 9 years later a sequel was born. < br / > < br / > Final thoughts : First of all, this is not a true sequel to Fulci's cult classic. Awesome score.",0
"This is all definitely the work of Mattei. It's fast paced and fun, but ultimately daft. < br / > < br / > There is a third, more chatty, variety of zombie.",0
Born Again is a sub - standard episode from season one. But the positives end there.,0
And it shows.,0
But it's worth the 2.,0

"Robert De Niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. I saw the capsule comment said "" great acting. """,0

"and she grabs joe. ... but i expected better from Caroline Munro. "". almost as bad as'Psycho'( 1998 ).",0
What a terrible movie.,0
! Slaughter High is intrinsically your emblematic 80s slasher flick.,0

"It's just not good. First, we get to see a'nerd'as he is picked on by a group of...",0

< br / > < br / > I am. dear god.,0
"However, that's not what I received. Which is clearly a quite unorthodox claim.",0
< br / > < br / > That's very rare. Why not use filming camera to show more of the landscapes instead? I hope we get to see other things like this.,0
"Maybe it has some value as a demonstration of what's wrong with the American ( and Canadian ) Left. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. It'like a two - hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. Manufactured Landscapes, however, offers only strange and bitter hopelessness.",0
"That's probably an exaggeration, but that's how I felt. I recently viewed Manufactured Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival.",0
"Sorry Ton, 1 out of 10!",0
I'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once. Now I had the best intentions when watching this one. Allow me to elaborate.,0
"< br / > < br / > "" This one too! "" And much more skillfully than in this movie. "" I'm referring, of course, to Domino. Was that supposed to be surprising? """,0

"Following 'I don't think so. The principal question is :'Was Domino supposed to be some kind of comedy? What of Domino did I hate over everything, and I mean everything, else?",0
The story?,0
"Tony Scott please give me my time back. I'm glad I did. Who is Domino Harvey? Frankly, I hate it.",0
Why did Domino become such a bad - ass tough bitch?,0
It is a caricature of stereotypes and genre. All different and yet all the same. yes even in action films this can happen. What about the depth of a look? Where are the films with Awareness? A story?,0

They'd be scarred for life.,0
I had to admit some of the effects were just wacky for the time. Why such a generic title? How random is this!? It was a all - out cluster of madness! Santa Claus???,0

"Personally, I thought this movie already did that! I sure hope that all they do is sing and make toys. This Santa movie starts off strange and I think Santa might be a pedo. Later, Santa meets with his friend, Merlin. Or, if you are Puerto Rican, like a vejigante mask with a goatee!",0
"Wow. Move over Satan, here's "" Santa Claus "".",0
Santa's Tentacles reach far and wide! Pitch... he is so useless. Very low budget but so fun to watch.,0

"I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I know cannot be what the director intended. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they stunk in this film. That could very well be highlight of the film. As for the mood throughout, it was extremely dull.",0

"The truth is though, I don't rate it. The hot oil, maggots and innards just didn't bother me. and just leaving the torture, it works on some levels. The truth is, I didn't find this film at all disturbing. She should be screaming like a banshee in pain.",0

At least Enos is kinda close.,0
DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Those commits might be correct about movie. Boycott the sponsors.,0
This movie is garbage!,0

First of all the robberies feel mostly like background. Rånarna is another fine example of a movie making very little sense. I rate it 3 / 10.,0
"Also, music is quite well. It does not succeed very well.",0
"It does speed up after the first hour but by then it's too clichéd to care. Yes, it's humour so twee a nun would be bored. The climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless Deux ex Machina I've ever seen.",0

"For much of the film, it works. < br / > < br / > Hello?",0

In this it feels more like an old cowboy western than any kind of myth. The effects are way too weak to carry this story. Anachronism? Arrows with explosive charges in 500AD?

Danielle Brett is Lundgren's eventual love interest and his brother's widow. Just the plot and premise immediately make it a B - Movie Porn at very best. To explain how classy and well To call it campy would be a huge understatement.,0
"First of all, the old saying'You can't judge a book by it's cover'applies here. Jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover. If you haven't seen the movie and don't mind spoilers read ahead. Very bad.",0
"If anything else though, it shows how underrated Lundgren is, as an actor.",0
"I've tried to like this film, really.",0
"It does damage to the original, so bad is it. In my book "" Basic Instinct "" was a perfect film.",0
"I cant understand at all why so many Godzilla fans think this is excellent, one of the best Godzilla films ever in fact.",0
"But till this battle royale, the film was really dull and pathetic. They fail, however and in the end Godzilla fights Ghidorah.",0
"Well, so is SHOAH. I like it. Then they act on them. about the worst ideas you've ever heard.",0
"More I won't say, but we all know Japan is doing reasonably well as 2010.",0
Those are just my rambling thoughts on flick.,0
A very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here. Possibly a copulation of both.,0
RATING : 4 out of 10.,0
The 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people.,0
No.,0
But there lies also some of the problems of this picture.,0
"For instance, at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear. The narrative doesn't move but proceeds at a snail's pace in an abrupt series of jerks. Actually "" movie "" is the wrong word. The credited thespians generally come off worse than the unknowns.",0
The acting here is really bad.,0
Boring. Horrible film.,0
"Tatum O'Neill was not in her element. The rest of the cast was also dismal. Who does that? Her performance seemed superficial, like a contestant at a beauty pageant.",0
The result just left the audience feeling rather inadequate.,0
The scenery looks like cheap Theatre. Then this is a movie for you! Cause i can love old film as well as new.,0
"but how? Oh blocking, who needs you? So eventually all the girls get killed off. and here's how the scene goes ( Guy and girl are in a field. He says it's because he saw it. < br / > < br / > OK, time for the story. and by killed off, i mean drug offscreen. there was no guy in that apartment! ooh. you showed ONE death?",0
Wow... OK.,0
"His background involves a man whose love is killed by another man. < br / > < br / > And why were the girls moving in models? How does this make you a demon? and says the vermin problem will be solved when they call "" the terminator "". Their careers had no point in the plot, and this seems like a forced situation. Please, write a script - - some deviation is fine, but this was a mess.",0
Real life has never been like this movie. And not aware.,0
< br / > < br / > What can I say?,0
If this is indeed the case than this review should probably be rewritten. Cara's situation is contrasted with that of Jesse ( Trent Millar ). Will she? That same week British Columbia legalizes gay marriage. It's possible that the campiness was purposeful.,0
"Talk about stupid AND unbelievable. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending - - oh my! < br / > < br / > However, this lame - brain, waaay - belated sequel has nothing. < br / > < br / > "" Basic Instinct 2 "" - - basically, ( Still predictable, though. ) Is Sharon Stone still gorgeous? No.",0
The worst.,0
fulci experiments with sci fi and fails.,0
I was certainly disappointed.,0
"Especially comedy spoofs. """,0
Great Work...,0
"Maybe catch it on TV, but it'not worth buying.",0
I was VERY disappointed with this film.,0
I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully. Same string of letters two entirely different meanings. Talk about ego!,0
More deception? Atheists he interviewed for the film were notable authors and scholars. Which is correct ( Acts 2 ).,0
I was curious to watch this movie. Jesus told a story about an evil king. He is love! Please use your brain.,0
He's not even coy about it. animation was also pretty damn bad.,0
"Thrilling, sexy trash, but trash nonetheless. It was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist.",0
Oh and also the Techno Music just made the film harder to watch.,0
As a spiritualist and non Christian. ?,0
the director seems to have an agenda! Duh!,0
"com, and Ronald Sipus, principal of fundamentalist Village Christian School, which Flemming attended as a boy.",0
"org. That seems like the most honest part of the movie, and it was too short. < br / > < br / > Anti - religious people will want more data. Harris also has some good ( and easily Google'd ) interviews on Salon.",0
This will be brief.,0
Why?,0
"I'm not recommending against seeing it. And this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to Christian teachings. However, anti - Christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue.",0
"Skip it. With that said, this movie does a pretty poor job of proving that thesis.",0
And the suspense is very low. There's no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. It had this specific Paul Verhoeven's style. The new composer is no Jerry Goldsmith and its shows. It's a pity that they made this film.,0
< br / > < br / > first we can examine his misleading claim about Hebrews 8. Really no reason to examine this much further because of a few very glaring and bias misleading statements.,0
I'm an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic and was thus expecting to enjoy this film.,0
"Then he brings up the chronology of Christianity's origins and presents an'ok'case, but not one that blew me away. OK, aside from the psychedelic background imagery, the info presented here was good.",0
"Most importantly, it lacks integrity.",0
He advocated strict immigration policies for Orientals. Some of that experience in another day and time would have been condemned as racism. London was part of the cause not a prophet crying in the wilderness. < br / > < br / > The film puts the cart before the horse.,0
Caught this movie on the tube on a Sunday.,0
"I mean!..... OMG. this film. Cut! "" And the editing!",0
Not exactly faithful to the novel. The poor of London coming out to sing?,0
I think I missed seeing half of the movie.,0
It's really like silly putty!,0
So how to classify it? He looks dog tired! Like it believes it does. I'm quite perplex about everything.,0
"The only thing I'd add is "" passionless. "" This movie is a "" deconstructed thriller "".",0
!,0
Why? I understand wanting to make a movie that is edgy and different. I understand the previous reviewer comments that this is a miss - understood movie.,0
Morgue attendant? A bit of a heartbeat would have been nice.,0
It did with this one. Argh.,0
< br / > < br / > Just awful. And the sex scenes are downright lame. ).,0
"I would wait for the bargain bins at your video shop, I'm sure it wont take long.",0
It certainly didn't have taste.,0
How bad was it?,0
Whatever happened to British TV drama?,0
A padded cell should indeed be left available.,0
Why was he still driving a car?,0
We purchased this series on DVD because of all of the glowing reviews we had seen here. All in all the complete litany of the radical religious right wing.,0
"! Captain Kirk "" is "". It was funny, diversified, and to some extent factual.",0
Denny Crane is just annoying.,0
I don't travel the same routes.,0
In my life I have seen many great and awful movies.,0
"Maybe I just don't "" get "" this film. I really thought Mac was really good.",0
A very very very dry humor / comedy. This movie is not. It had all of the same features.,0
On balance not a lot to be said for this. By this time he'd made around a half dozen films and had still to find a style. This is perfectly true but how did Mitchum KNOW?,0
This movie look like an amateur one.,0
"The film has its moments, but so far, it's my least - favorite Chaney picture. I did enjoy clown sequences, and was very impressed at the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, though astonishingly young. ( Let's hear Luigi and his blond girlfriend's argument, please! )",0
"Tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. Although he is not her biological father, he has raised her like a daughter. That kind of "" ick "" factor permeates throughout the film.",0
"This may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret. The same difficulty I have with the musical version of "" Les Miserables "" applies equally to "" Oliver. "" All this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me.",0
Please change it. Get Tritter out. Everyone I talk to says the same thing.,0
House hires some guy and de - physicalizes Tritter.,0
< br / > < br / > This was a very sorry return for Zatoichi. See one of the earlier versions or the 2003 ALL - NEW version.,0
Not the same experience at all.,0
This movie is just the opposite. The raspy voice - overs seemed amateurish to me.,0
"I respect Alex Cox the filmmaker, I really do.",0
"Not recommended. or "" For goodness sake, get ON with it! "" I'm frankly suspicious when I see that a film's director also wrote it.",0
They all deserve better. These people don't flirt - they just do it.,0
Experimental?,0
"We only see him attacking, never collecting. No. < br / > < br / > So is this guy a vampire? To fulfill second part of his bid for immortality.",0
"This movie tries to shock the viewer, and it sure does.",0
"Don't misunderstand, I'm a horror girl.",0
"The story is just crap! < br / > < br / > DO NOT WATCH!!!! ! This was just an awful experience! You're funny when you are light hearted, just like Ed Wood. Uwe, don't go all dark again!",0
"a Uwe Boll film and positive comments? Maybe to shock us? Each of these videos ends in a speeded up decomp of the victim. Hmmm..... well, I for one am not squeamish and can handle seeing anything on film. It's Wow!",0
"There are simply huge gaps in the story and dialogue. "" Of course, nothing makes much sense, either. Why don't the cops ever use their radios? Seed "" is torture porn... no doubt about it. ( Didn't he think of doing this sooner? )",0
No wonder this movie was found at bargain bin in HMV. Period.,0
"That'really a "" NOT "".",0
I try to find some reason to explain a horror writers art but this stuff... pure crap. < br / > < br / > I dunno why I try not to totally hate his works.,0
! Seed just isn't one of those. Maybe he should stick to comedy?,0
F * ck this movie. It's crap. The actors are awful as well.,0
A complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates.,0
"Seed "" is another most unfortunate of proof that. You know, like it's popular to hate Uwe Boll whether you liked his movies or not. You're actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype. who wears a bag over his head.",0
this is my first review for any movie i have seen. I cant believe people actually make movies like this. Hello.,0
> _ > < br / > < br / > Plain and simple.,0
"And technology is cold. And soulless. Today a horror, a terror film of this kind costs more than a million dollars.",0
"But then came "" Seed, "" and the counter was reset to Zero, keeping his bid for legitimacy and respect that much further out of reach. I think not.",0
Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. OH!,0
"Guess what... they just bury him alive to solve the problem. Cops bust Seed in his house, act stupid and get slashed in the dark. < br / > < br / > 3.",0
The difference being that Mostel's character knew he was making bowel fill. Maybe Uwe knows it too.,0
I give this a 4 ( four ).,0
And the plot was completely ludicrous ( sp? ).,0
But there's more to a movie than that. She surprised me the most.,0
One to avoid.,0
Just in case. Swashbucklin '. In fact I could not even finish it. They should of gave Nic Cage a hat and a bull - whip.,0
This film has nothing to recommend it. How does that happen?,0
"7 rating is beyond belief. This has to be the most stupid, insulting movie I have ever seen. It deserves nothing better than a 2. How this film gains a 6.",0
It is appalling.,0
I stopped paying attention around 30 minutes. What a drag... What a disappointment!,0
This movie never lets the Bad Guys have the upper hand. It's terrible. One that keeps you wondering until the very end.,0
"Firstly, why did said Knights move the treasure from Europe to America? How do they figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute? Well I don't know why I bothered. Is he getting too old?!",0
So Ian tries to kill Ben. He's set on protecting the treasure. your guess is as good as mine. ).,0
"Maybe because of the casting. The Masons. Oh, I forget. It's how one can enjoy sci - fi and horror. Why?",0
The Plot is sooooooo predictable. It's just not realistic.,0
Gates is appalled. Huh!! ),0
"The two Vampire Girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints. His excuse is that he only produced it. HUH?? At one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss, but stop. Jon Bon Jovi looks like a girl. keep reaching out to her. I wonder who has to clean it up. "" As far as gore is concerned, a few heads are ripped off, and the blood spurts profusely.",0
"But oh dear, this is to Indiana Jones what Speed 2 is to Speed.",0
"Oh brother! Except, that episode of the Brady Bunch was much better than this whole film! National Treasure is about as over - rated and over - hyped as they come. Simply put : it's just OK at best.",0
"The only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it. Truly grotesque. It was that listless and formulaic. At one point, Cage's character says, "" Don't you ever shut up? "" Creepy.... and camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she's a child.",0
"Nicely done. The stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in This kills the enjoyability of the entire film. The stalker kills a cop inside a police station while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away. Unfortunately, they are stupid beyond belief. No point in being unfair, right? As far as likability is concerned, the protagonists in Say Yes are a quaint married couple.",0
I can't believe someone really made such a movie.,0
"Sheesh. Who is very pretty, but really no more than a mediocre actress. And don't even get me started on that terrible'twist'ending. ' < br / > < br / > The only plus point in this film, for me, is Sang Mi Chu.",0
Whoa nelly! Sounds like a cool story. The flabby chicks were also so so. It was awful. This movie was acted by pure amateurs.,0
"The deaths are all relatively quick. What's up with that? Yes, I did watch "" unrated "" version.",0
It's not even comically bad.,0
"Five utterly brainless twenty - something friends take a trip to Asia. There's no actual plot to describe. The quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan. One girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat ; yikes. """,0
"Overall, I would say don't bother with this one.",0
This was NO class at all! And Braindead was fun! And what about the gore? A really sad rip - off on Hostel.,0
An absolute joke.,0
"Yes, there was a lot of gore and some nudity. I agree with the last reviewer that this movie had terrible acting.",0
"The locals decide to lock them all in a theatre, and kill them. Avoid!",0
).,0
"WTF. The obvious similarities to Hostel. How jarring, and not in a good way.",0
Was it for the Triads? Was it to make snuff films to sell?,0
DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! !,0
"This movie could not have been any lamer. Ugh, what can I say other than, ugh.",0
The choppy editing? The nonsensical plot? ?,0
I was so wrong.,0
t! I'll take Hostel or Wolf Creek over this pile any day.,0
"I actually gave up a night out to watch this, its all been done before. IE. now thats scary!",0
"You know,'worse than Jaws 4'- kind of bad. Well made gore? No way.",0
< br / > < br / > Plot? I hope that people considering this movie read my comment and decide against it. There really is none. It's basically Saw but in China and a whole hell of a lot worse. Cast?,0
?,0
"Aren't there enough brown - eyed actors out there? Period. Jesus never claimed to be God. In the movie, John the Baptist says this! He was a full - blooded Jew! ( Another example is David Lean's "" Dr. Zhivago "". )",0
"It started off really good, with a man running from something.",0
A small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires.,0
The last reviewer was very generous.,0
Is this a classic like it says? I found Darkness to be just too DARK. But it is a good first try. The actors are all pretty uneven and hammy. NO.,0
"It is very, very x5 low budget.",0
is chased by some vampire / zombie - creatures.,0
"< br / > < br / > * SPOILER... WHAT actors? I mean, FANGLESS?? ?",0
"I know my schlock. This movie was horrible, simply put. And I know this movie sucks.",0
Could Pixar have not entered it? NOTHING. I assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre.,0
About the worst movie in distribution right now!,0
I have to say I hated this movie.,0
this movie should be seen nevermore! eff off.,0
I didn't think he could be so bad.,0
"( Or Poe. ) Oh, yes, out comes the poet - shirt - it's another boy who thinks he's Byron.",0
It's just plain awful! I never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was.,0
It was done in 1986. Slow and unfocused! Uh uh.,0
The story is very simple.,0
This movie isn't very good.,0
"The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the Aliens Say Goodbye. I enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder, and part one 5 times as much.",0
The second one wasn't as good but still quite funny. The rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos.,0
! But what the hell happened?,0
Ring parodies are not funny. This movie is bad. They're so dated. You want proof? Whatever happened to real humor?,0
Everything looked real.,0
But that's all this movie is. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. He betrays us. They're breathtaking.,0
"< br / > < br / > One thing to note is the terrible voice acting. < br / > < br / > As a whole, the movie doesn't really go anywhere. A huge problem with them, however, is the vast overruse of light bloom.",0
"The pair actually "" duck "" each other's non - existent bullets.",0
< br / > < br / > The writing : pathetic. < br / > < br / > The directing : pathetic. < br / > < br / > The acting : pathetic.,0
"I'm not sure this is one of those. At first I thought I'd hooked it up wrong. It really does. Worked for Roger Corman. But alas, no. I mean, I'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker.",0
"I thought the movie said "" get ON the bus ""...? 100 % UNTRUE.",0
He is capable of much more than this movie. Better luck next time Spike.,0
It's well crap. The acting is passable. Save your time.,0
These are some of the Heroes of Horror.,0
It's supposed to be a comedy....,0
"Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to it's potential. It just falls short over and over again. """,0
But this is just misconceived horror sap. It did not sustain my interest. His fame bewilders me.,0
"Ah, the sex - and - gore movie. Oops, so much for that secret existence. Other than that, it really wasn't worth my time. It gets real ugly from here.",0
"There really isn't much of a story here. The house is also a most impressive set. There are, as I said, some effective scenes by the director... Why? We have the two girls.",0
It isn't difficult to see why!,0
This is far from only case.,0
would I be too bold to accuse HG of plagiarism here? ) It was because of toils and efforts of the ( uncredited - why? Japanese creators.,0
"Save your bucks, it's not worth rental. Words cannot express how bad this film is.",0
Lame.,0
I would rather get a root canal than view this film again.,0
! 7 here at IMDb.,0
What a waste. !,0
This leads me to the biggest issue that I had with this film.,0
It just isn't an interesting or compelling movie to watch. He simply isn't convincing in his role. This is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black & white. I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player?,0
"I don't recommend this one! Yes, it is THAT bad!",0
"But not a lot. Mind you, they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too. Even as trashy movies go it's not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining. She should have bitten him. < br / > < br / > As it stands, the cast have no chemistry whatsoever.",0
Likely?,0
"That's why I give it two stars. And the music is OK, at least it doesn't irritate me.",0
"You won't miss much by missing out on this film. Ivan ( Valeri Nikolayev ) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained.",0
As I've said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball curio. < br / > < br / > The film isn't very good.,0
"Instead, the less you know about Gogol, the better. It is based on Nikolai Gogol's story "" Viy "" which is a classic in Russia. "" In a strange nod to Russianness, journalist is named Ivan Berkhoff.",0
It's the presence of ( Alec Baldwin ). ! It's surely insanity or bad tasting? So not to mention ( literally! ),0
As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw enough said.,0
Nowhere near the original. But the directing is very poor.,0
"Basinger does well and certainly looks good, but James Woods is artificially hammy in a silly mob - magnet role.",0
Didn't enjoy this one to much. And what action there is to!! It stars Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as the Mc Coy's.,0
"Like someone else points out, Peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action / adventure heist genre. One viewing was more than enough, not just because it didn't have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made. < br / > < br / > The movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words.",0
Too bad that Tieney's career never really gelled.,0
< br / > < br / > Jane The kids are all a mess.,0
< br / > < br / > Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno come in towards the end. This is a story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. I guess film is promoting independence and some good old self - esteem. The parents have divorced and mom remains back east in the house.,0
This film has no tension like that. A real let down for me personally. There is no army of masters.,0
Perhaps 4.,0
"The entire look of the film is just ugly. But the stockpile of these bodies is a small one, and Rock needs more - and he prefers them fresher.",0
"How surprising. < br / > < br / > And yes, the music score mostly resembled whale sounds. < br / > < br / > 2 / 10.",0
I almost fell asleep.,0
God!...,0
"Ships "" meeting "" on sea... Ideas of feces as an object of value ( if it was feces ). ! And so boring. Typical empty post - modern "" conceptual "" art. I just don't buy it, sorry.",0
It certainly prepared me. I watched this movie as a preview of a Matthew Barney art exhibit. < br / > < br / > What was the point of the movie?,0
Nothing special.,0
"Which is about the art itself. At 135 minutes, it adds to its pretension by being boring to boot.",0
Mr. Barney you have been outted! And BTW I am filmmaker.,0
"You get from it what you take from it. A very long and ponderous two hours and fifteen minutes. If this sounds like your cup of tea, then you will absolutely LOVE it! This is the very definition of an art film.",0
In the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the leads's social life as a father - snooze! boring and pointless.,0
Indira Varma's character Adrienne Holland is too similar to Jennifer Morrison's doctor Cameron to be a co - incidence.,0
"As a satire it's very silly, so silly that it becomes almost unwatchable.",0
and it's also extremely convoluted. it doesn't really work as either.,0
"Even when I got that the joke was on me, I still felt Winter Kills to be a pretty awful movie. So I stuck with it to the end, hoping that the whole tangled mess would untangle itself. The cast is packed with extraordinary talent but most of them are wasted.",0
Camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively. I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband!,0
gore was decent. !,0

But it got old very fast.,0

He was just too old for this role.,0
"If anyone knows of one please tell me. < br / > < br / > just a note... As the front cover says "" The hamlet of our time, for our time "".",0
"Unfortunately, I'm not making any of this up.",0

What a waste of an outstanding cast! Those few moments were more entertaining than previous 2 hours.,0
That leaves nobody to adequately play Jane Russell.,0
"Looking at it now, it seems charming.",0
Not ever. Show me the humor! The movie is just not funny! Is it the commentaries by Arne Scheie?,0
Trust me.,0
Just don't expect anything out of the ordinary. This romantic comedy isn't too bad.,0

I don't know.,0
One Missed Call was just as boring as that one. Didn't keep my attention.,0

This movie was horrifying.,0
Painful viewing.,0
It was a lone star that few people had heard of. What was the point of that? In total there's about two or three good jokes. The film is simply overrun with cameos. The rest are either tasteless or rehashed from IMOM.,0
I swit ched off after ten minutes.,0
It was banned in Chinese cinema and i can see why. this is not an art film it's of waste of celluloid.,0
This is the worst.,0
"I'd be sorry to see Chinese cinema judged against this benchmark. Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Two hours in and I was totally past caring. This sorry effort just doesn't measure up at all.",0
This movie wants to elaborate that criminals are a product of modern society. Even after having read his gruesome diaries?,0
"In short, I don't think Carl would be too happy. The book "" Panzram : A Journal of Murder "" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O.",0
"I was really, really disappointed with this movie. cripple the non - psycho characters in film. Whoop - de - do. ""? < br / > < br / > what the hells he been eating down there? Why is he so damn hard to kill?",0
Yes!,0

"( For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was'Carlos,'which I found humorous, but I digress. ) Uh oh. Another weak third - season entry,'Is There In Truth No Beauty?",0
This is what I mean by sexist.,0
"Forget this one, and go buy Leonard's most recent album if you want to pay tribute to him. It is so bloody PRECIOUS with its endless close - ups of over emoting singers. But this film is simply terrible.",0
"< br / > < br / > Cohen fans, don't say I didn't warn you! Gee, what a concept!",0
This film should have been only 10 minutes. There is not a single footage of Cohen's past.,0
"More often, the covers are badly sung folk versions. A huge disappointment for a big Cohen fan. !",0
Some of the camera - work is dismal. The collaboration with U2 is a farce. At times it seemed the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film. I would not consider myself as one of Leonard Cohen's greatest fans. Warming and humble. Part of the score hardly recalls any associations I may have expected. Perhaps a reference to his once use of LSD.,0
"Too bad it didn't stay in the family. If there is a form of art that doesn't need embellishments, it's Cohen's art. < br / > < br / > A sad show, really, and sadder if you truly love Cohen as I do.",0
This film was a disaster from start to finish. ).,0
"Disclaimer : I'm a person of color. Big fat Small eyes? Big body Small dick? Oh, well, do I need to say more?",0
! I will say movie was OK besides the major Fla!!!!!,0
They should hang their heads in shame. There is no hope for the British film industry whilst idiots are running the show. I rest my case. ! This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen.,0
I am unfortunate to say that that happened. It's nowhere close to a good movie.,0
What man? The complete and utter lack of respect for teacher.,0
"< br / > < br / > The storytelling, in both structure and content, is simplistic and trite. Did he alone nurture his subsequent affiliation with Suge Knight? This film reminded me of The Sopranos, and not in a good way.",0
And not even particularly well. Blah blah blah. < br / > < br / > What a tedious film.,0
But has a few good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good.,0
There were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the film. < br / > < br / > The cast is misleadingly good. [ That's the last time that'll happen. ],0
I might have enjoyed it more if I hadn't known that. Maybe.,0
I felt bad for him. Haven't we seen this all before?,0
Now THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! And the best part?,0
It's terrible.,0
This just doesn't employ professional actors. Then it rewards the winner money.,0
Its a beautifully acted pairing and really is one of the screens great couples. Its a huge let down after the classic Tarzan and His Mate which is possibly the best film in the series.,0
Can Jim stop him?,0
"Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? Both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry. How cool is that? There are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that's about it. Insignificant and low - brained ( haha! )",0
"This whatever it is, is attached to the brain. At first Jim is able to resist the brain's mind control.",0
A spoiler. The horror is hilarious.,0
"No, I don't. < br / > < br / > It's nothing new. Creep - "" Your journey terminates here. "" I wish they wouldn't do that, it's done so many times, it's boring and gets predictable. It jumps right into the action.",0
The scenes inside the PRI complex are especially bad.,0
Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films.,0
"I mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and I kept thinking "" When is it going to end ""?",0
"Like all good magicians, Abanazer here has a lovely assistant. Which is a shame. Most of the film's sex angle is laughably gratuitous.",0
"My vote is three. < br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available Before they die, they curse the next generations of their executioners.",0
"wow! i mean, hallo!",0
"Shoot, that bar set must have cost a bundle. I'm just surprised he didn't blow up anything. Just think, it cost a total of $ 250, 000 to make "" Clerks "".",0
"A typical "" Chick - Feel - Good - Flick "", one could say. It's not worth either the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. THAT was true Bruckheimer stuff.",0
< br / > < br / > Indeed strong points are sadly lacking.,0
< br / > < br / > The film's only assets are the amazingly beautiful female leads.,0
Too obvious.,0
But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer? These women are nothing more the whores. I find this most strange.,0
"Jersey girl goes to New York to become a song writer. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. < br / > < br / > And finally, the music. Or wasting depending on how you look at it.",0
"( Or if you do see it, don't expect much. ) Wow. Am I the only one disturbed by that?",0

'the big chief barks. 'Stand out! Let's give them more of what they already like! 'We could call it Sex Cops Violence?,0
To say I was disappointed would be something of an understatement.,0

"Or, 2 ; you're seeing it with someone under ten years old. Sophia Myles From the off, Thunderbirds is wrong, wrong, wrong.",0

There was little physical violence.,0

Maybe even before.,0
Utter rubbish. All my mates at school watched. I grew up ( b.,0
OK.. this movie could have been soooo good!,0
"Then came August 2004, when the movie was finally released. Critics panned it, but I still wanted to go. I just couldn't wait. Thunderbirds are GO!",0

"The Ford, Ford, FORD! < br / > < br / > This motion picture is almost pure blasphemy. And, there were characters who did get killed, although most were bad guys.",0
I remember it very clearly. That is all I remember. maybe.,0
"This is really horrifying. No gore, no suspense, no violence, nothing. The only scary thing about this piece of scum is that majority of the IMDb users gave it a 10.",0
Neither did I.,0

"< br / > < br / > Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense? < br / > < br / > This is quite a depressing film when you think about it. Too bad the movie didn't concentrate more on that. Why did Steve Guttenberg jump ship as well? Remain on earth, and you will face illness and eventually your demise. After all, he had found his lady - love. < br / > < br / > Gwen Verndon showed that she could still dance. This is a classic stinker with a big named cast, mostly seniors who were well past their prime and bedtime in this one.",0
"So that lost a few stars for me right there. Stick to the book, folks, it's much better. Undeniably good writing and interesting story. So I imagined somebody like Pierce Brosnan in the role.",0
I just couldn't cared less really at times. In that regard these movies always seem like a wasted opportunity. < br / > < br / > But what's hurting this movie more is its writing.,0
"Please, even if you didn't like the movies, give the book series a chance.",0
Gotta love her.,0
would not either.,0
"As cheap as this disc was, I feel ripped off. No preaching.",0
"The music is schizophrenic. I can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane, but that's it. The characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped. At least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory. This is not the film to rally Christians around it. The dialogue sometimes sounds rushed.",0
"Second, it made no sense. If you hadn't read the book, you'd have no idea what was going on. The ending was awful.",0
"The acting is weak and uninspiring, the story even weaker. The effects are wholly unoriginal and flat.",0
"What an interesting day that would be! Will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the "" Rapture "" is imminent? Never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent. < br / > < br / > But THAT, of course, won't be enough. It is, after all, good old fashioned Capitalism at work.",0
I'll just read the Bible. Plus it's yet another movie shot in Canada that purports to be New York City. ).,0
This movie is one reason IMDB should allow a vote of 0 / 10. The script looks like it was written in haste.,0
OF COURSE THERE'S SPOILERS!!!!!,0
I like B - movies.,0
What?,0
"Yes, I really was saved.",0
OH MY GOD!,0
My peaceful rage is ending.,0
it has a TV - movie feeling to it.,0
LOL!,0
"RIDICULOUS! they disappeared! "". they're missing! "" Brad Johnson was laughable. Watch Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. and start crying and yelling. < br / > < br / > Poor direction.",0
"And that, perhaps, makes the movie important.",0
It's a little bit too late then! Just how commercial did this film prove.,0
Really. < br / > < br / > The plot needs no reprising.,0
"What can you expect from a low - budget, "" B "" movie? It's been a while since seeing this the first time, so I watched it again with the second movie in the series.",0
"Left Behind fell woefully short on this. For one thing, it radically deviates from the book. In the film it's quick and artificial.",0
STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS.,0
"What the hell was the director thinking with this move? Im sure one of "" teens "" plays bingo down the local pub - but she's 40 - 45. < br / > < br / > Anyway, good for a laugh but just another waste of film and time. He was scared of the dark?",0

"The script is absolutely terrible in every way for 80 minutes, it has every bad slasher cliché, the character's are awful, the dialogue is terrible & it's hard to care about anyone or anything in this pretty worthless excuse for a teen slasher film. I will now spoil the ending so anyone who doesn't want to know it stop reading now.",0
No one could be terrorised on the London Underground. Absolutely laughable film.,0
"Where to start, this movie started badly and ended badly!",0
That is not a compliment.,0
The film'ending is particularly disappointing.,0

"For instance, TWO is shot like a 70s French policier. < br / > < br / > This is figured in the film's very tiresome America vs France dialectic. This can be seen in the pattern of the two movies.

"The problem with reviewing this film is that, a. ) An unfortunate low point in Frankenhimer's filmography.",0
"This film has no story, plot or hint of purpose. Their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster. So we can ignore the beginning completely. < br / > < br / > Want a silver lining?",0
It moved me to leave this comment! Pathetic. The ease at which Doyle finds his guy is just pathetic.,0
urgh! the dog was also very good.,0
absolutely trash. we get it john.,0
He just puts his head down and sulks out of room. NO! Ron Perlman is laughable.,0
I also wish they had negative rating options. The acting ( other than Ron P. ) was poor.,0

It just seemed tio me to be so uneven!,0
"But don't worry, this cheerful and pleasant movie has a happy ending, because Bobby find his son. He could forgive himself for killing Primo if he saved Bobby's son. It is NOT about a fan.",0

Then the fun really begins.,0
"< br / > < br / > The film was set in "" England "". Why do I watch movies like this?",0
The story is sorta interesting but flat. And the special effects aren't that special.,0

Kind of. And kill them. It gets even stupider.,0

This movie has no point but to show Derek naked. More evidence that no one cared.,0
She tracks him down ( how? ),0
Maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps. Bo's body can only get you so far.,0
He must have wandered off the set of a much better film. How did Tarzan get poisoned by the way? This whole movie is screwed up. Not To mention plotting. Eww! It didn't make good sense at all.,0
"Some of the IMDb reviews address this point, but here's my $. Though her dad is supposed to have been missing for a long time, she finds him effortlessly. This category uses the character as a vehicle for, of all things, soft porn. < br / > < br / > Well, this film is in a third category of Tarzan films, and I hope it remains a category of one because it's awful.",0
But it got old real quick. < br / > < br / > You know what'worst? He should have stayed with his strength. This film is boring!,0
Definitely worst film I ever paid to see. < br / > < br / > The only positive I can concede is the lush location shooting.,0
the only really bad movies are boring and tasteless.,0
"Yes... Bo Derek and Miles O'Keeffe are beautiful ( um, congratulations on having a working libido. ) but if that's your excuse for giving this schlock a good rating you really should visit a porn store and stock up. But this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum - the tease is the only thing going on here ; at the time of its release and now. There's nothing inherently wrong with using films eased moral constraints to portray an erotic side to the Tarzan legend. There's nothing inherently wrong with the premise that Tarzan doesn't speak.",0
"! However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is awful.",0
"It is said that when this film premiered in 1981, the Edgar Rice Burrows estate tried to take legal action against it. Unlike Johnny Weismuller with his pidgin English or Ron Ely who speaks the language fluently, the O'Keefe Tarzan is mute. Alas, as they say, Mortals plan and God laughs. Given some of Bo and Richie's dialog, though, this is probably not a bad thing. But that shouldn't blind anybody to the fact that in 1981, a pretty ugly blotch appears on both men's CVs. It is a great tragedy that both Richard Harris and John Derek are no longer with us.",0
And then : Orang Utans in Africa?,0
Saves Bo. Oh look!,0
There simply is not enough there.,0
"Also, why did he always look like rotted corpse?",0
"During the early 1980's, Kurt Thomas was something of a hero in the United States. The film is obviously derived from "" Enter The Dragon, "" as are most martial arts pictures.",0
"Never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume! I'm not sure who started that rumor. With all that's bad about the movie visually, the sound is actually pretty entertaining. As a kid, my friends and I all believed that Gymkata was the most violent, bloody movie ever made. Could it be headed for cult - classic status? Where is MST3K when we need it?",0
Only in the 80's could a movie with such a bad idea get made. Twice.,0

The ending... meh. Still there's the germ of a good action adventure here. The so called script is just this side of incompetent. See other reviews for the many howlers throughout.,0
"< br / > < br / > Sounds promising doesn't it? They can be found in the movie's strange details. It has to be seen to be believed. How this movie escaped the wrath of MST3K I'll never know. """,0

I think I'll skip! It's so horrible I can't stop watching it! Jason Most is very questionable. Some of the camera work is good.,0
It's not about * details *.,0
"This is my first movie review, by the way, and I registered with IMDb just to rave at this movie's badness. Puke. When many people say it's the "" worst movie I've ever seen "", they tend to say that about virtually any movie they didn't like. The special effects, what few there are, look like they were done 15 years earlier.",0
"The jokes make no sense. The acting was terrible. God - Awful even. Avoid! I don't need to go into plot details, read other reviews.",0
Once upon a time in the mid 1990s I used to write for DOCTOR WHO fanzines and the whole of fandom was holding its breathe about the new American produced DOCTOR WHO TVM. I know nothing about fencing ( Everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence or not.,0
I liked those movies. This is just a bad movie.,0
The special effects are cheesy as heck.,0

"Whaddya mean "" we "", paleface? When in truth, most of Clinton's "" Facts "" added up to guacamole. The Marines didn't storm the Temple Mount. I'll get to the movie in a minute.",0

So what was it? No.,0
"I'm not a big fan of the Stooges'slapstick, but I find their history interesting. Joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about this.",0
"Obviously, nothing. Just look at history of the other teams and tell me I'm wrong.",0
"The effects are, of course, poor. It makes no sense.",0
"< br / > < br / > 4. ( And indeed, their characters get lost in this film! ) If you're a Toby fan you'll love the songs. The editing didn't help this mess at all.",0

And poor Captain Hook a TOTAL clown. The only star is for her. ! < br / > < br / > The story itself then? This movie makes Wendy a babbling idiot.,0
"Avoid this crappy film at all costs. Honestly, I wanted all of them to die.",0
One day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. Into The Blue 2 is a sequel only by name. They were hired to find two big containers.,0
Now these two are brilliant adaptations. He could have at least tried to do a British accent. They could just as well have been cited by statues.,0
G. C. Scott is laughable. The ending is ludicrous.,0

"< br / > < br / > This Jane Eyre for example completely leaves out Gateshead and begins with Jane's arrival at Lowood. But even if the editing were better, the film would not be. And this is about all which happens at Lowood.",0

"If so, they failed utterly. < br / > < br / > Avoid at all costs.",0
Everybody happy except the audience. Maybe this is the only good thing. Hope you fall into neither group.,0
( I am not against violence in film. There are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have overstated this.,0
Badly made.,0
"Describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art. I can see that difference. He will get a lot of negative critics. But : the world is cruel like this, and it's not funny. Film - technically it's a good one. How does a shy boy come to such a cruelty? People don't like it.",0

"No one can save poor Robert. This is Clay's first film, I would be delighted if is his last.",0

"The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace ; one loses hope for it early on. ).",0
This is the most disturbing film I have ever seen. For these reasons I would not recommend anyone seeing it. This film should have a big WARNING label on it. You've been warned.,0
If a feeling can be vacuous - this is it. I have seen it.,0
It was awful!,0
Violence whether real or not always has an impact. But what was the point? ! In this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for.,0
A comment on the film itself perhaps?,0
"Thomas Clay has been mixing with the wrong types. Is this guy for real? yet he has filmed the most disgusting piece of SIMULATED violence. That's the trouble with young people these days, they have no respect. Clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our TVs. < br / > < br / > Shame on all involved.",0
At least in my opinion.,0
The community is represented as dysfunctional. The female characters in the film offer no relief. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is creepy. There is just one word for this film. He assumes the audience are ignorant of world atrocities. Appalling.,0
This was not an overly'shocking'film.,0
"Scarecrow is stupid. I watch crappy movies for fun. Wah. "" Boyfriend chases kid into corn field.",0
Spoiler alert!,0
I think it was a big mistake choosing this style for characters. That was not the case here. I stayed only because I had another show after it. Actually the story was the worst thing in that movie. It just had a feeling of a 3D shoot'n'run computer game.,0
"But, IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was kind of pretty.",0
Nazi's???? Horrible.,0
"What?!?? 4 left and the whole world has ended! But a lot of it was clichés one after another. Why are people saying this is "" mind blowing? "" It was one of the shortest movies I've ever seen, and thank god!",0
Which... is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect. I would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good.,0
"I've only seen those three of his, but they prove he's an awesome director. I really did. Well, OK, that's what I got from it. But no, it failed on so many levels. I was so excited to finally have seen it.",0

Not.,0
"I hope it was because of this film. HE dint come over, SHE had too. You might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself.",0
I was very Disappointed.,0
"If you had never heard of the real story of Gram Parsons then it might seem a reasonably entertaining diversion. Michael Shannon is due credit for pretty much the same reasons, except he's a hippy stoner. First of all, this movie isn't a complete disaster.",0
Stupid hippy? Check. Scene with Knoxville. Awful plot contrivances? Where to start?,0
"Wow! That's O. K., no one knows that. Mythology?",0
I doubt this will ever even be a cult film. What could have been clever and moving was campy.,0

"The story, while not exactly original, certainly showed some promise. I can't remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job of directing a film. None of that mattered though... at all.",0
This is no small feat for an independent film.,0

8 / 10.,0
This movie is totally boring. It doesn't have any of these.,0
But most of them don't make the effort or weren't given chance. The first lies with Morty. Here is a brief overview.,0
Impressed!,0
!,0
"Krista and Edward end up falling in love with each other. Wow! It is inspired by a true story. "" Krista ends up having Edward live up in their attic. The Man In The Attic "" is a movie set in the 1910s. So on and so on and so on.",0
Propably for a reason. Or any taiwanese movie?,0
And I WAS entertained.,0
"< br / > < br / > Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England. I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous.",0
I was truly surprised. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. She / He had hell of a lot of talent.,0
"< br / > < br / > Francine's only friend is played by Edith Massey, possibly the worst actress ever. Her daughter is the sluttiest slut in town.",0
"someone might venture. Run, it's Dr. Kissinger! "" No.",0
"Well, as babe - fests go, Martial Angels is hard to beat. The eye candy is top quality. The story is weak, the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic.",0
"< br / > < br / > Elsewhere, the film just fell to pieces. Well, that's my opinion anyway. That didn't leave much else.",0
I had seen One the Buses the film and thought it one of the worst films I have ever seen.,0
We know who dies. We know how it was done.,0
That probably would have been best.,0
"Well she may have killed the cat as well. It just isn't * generally * used in quite this sort of way. ) The character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane. And hangs her pieces of ( African ) artwork in the living room!! And backed up the toilet! ( Well, there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings. And so on.",0
The horror!,0
"Morty morphs into the dad and a tree, walks around and makes stupid wisecracks. BLAH!",0

View if you dare. It was pure madness. Wow! 00 on this film. OK?,0
They used way too much slow motion for fight scenes.,0
< br / > < br / > Did i hell.,0
My vote is four. The low - pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation.,0
!,0
"Very, very poor taste!",0
I've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years. I'm so confused.,0
Deal with it.,0
"Don't get fooled by the rating, it's way too good. As always.",0
Or as I should say Steven So - dull! !,0
"let's talk. really? bro i know who you really are, i know the truth about the Nico movie.",0
I mean firstly I love Seagal. The story is terrible. Why dub the man?,0
WOW!,0
So just avoid this movie.,0
< br / > < br / > This is truly abominable in every way possible.,0
< br / > < br / > Bad cover. Bad title. The dubbing there was ( which made him sound like Martin Sheen with a groin problem! ) I know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here ( perhaps not Steveday! ),0
I guess that is no more.,0
I turned it off in about 20 minutes. !,0
drss1942 really took the words right out of my mouth.,0
I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie. Now he's forgotten again. Basically it is horror movie disguised as an action film.,0
"< br / > < br / > Much was promised. Except "" Monty Python Meets "" War of The Worlds "" with all the humour taken out. 00 outlay. It is possible the Director did show up for the shoot. Just unbelievable.",0
yeah. < br / > < br / > Did I mention this movie totally sucks and Steven Seagal is a complete joke?,0
This is the bottom of the Septic tank here. Can ya blame him? The action is terrible and very badly done. Was this movie shot in the Dark?,0
"I'm a huge Steven Seagal fan. Yes, it's that bad.",0
"Plot - holes and loose ends are abound in the film that's for sure. The cast too are poor, unable to salvage anything here. Attack Force is a mess. populace. Who knows how director Michael Keusch originally intended this film? He looks I managed this and I'm proud.",0
"The situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is Manichaean. There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER. Its point is childish, with a sense of vengeance. This is not a parody or an art film, thus you can't even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure. What is a movie?",0
"So what we have here is pure exposition. That's it. To make it worse the VO also explains what's happening on the screen! Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. The problem, as usual, resides in the story itself.",0
( congratulations! ) The character named Tim Watcher needed some in - dept approach.,0
"There is no reason. If anything, this isn't even dramedy.",0
"Accompanied by a security guard, a businessman and a seemingly intoxicated tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned, but they are not alone.",0
Think The Yellow Submarine as done by the old EC Comics. That simply isn't true.,0

I'm honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on this one. !,0

"is that it?... Atmospherically strong, the set up was great. Did I dose off?",0
"But it all ends when the first lordi monster appears. Just finished watching, can't say I was impressed.",0
"But, let's face it, their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents.",0
"We don't care about the characters. And most importantly - no thrills, no chills. Even that film knew more about itself. ) ( Remember "" Cube ""? Too bad really.",0
"Floater had common plot of : picked on kid kills people in revenge. She's also encouraged to meet with a psychic. I can't imagine that there's actually a 192 minute version! One of them has, and he's very anxious.",0
Trash as trash can!,0
"Oh god, what a horrible, horrible film. Please.",0
"Stupid script, bad casting, endless boredom. Like Werner VonBraun, without whom we would have no space program.",0
"Oh, cruel Karma. It may not be true to the text My advice?",0
Beautiful and moving. What a shame it's attached to this film.,0
But her character is not convincing. The movie can be praised for its good use of architecture. Not at all.,0
"But i don't think I ll b chasing DVD, just yet.",0
"Las Vegas Lady co - stars Stuart Whitman. Intricate, huh?",0
I was somewhat disappointed with this film. YAWN. Not even close.,0

"How right they are! In this case, the majority gives it a "" one "". virus.",0
"No, I'm not kidding. Then they get knocked off in the same way. Who me? Worked with "" The Wizard of Oz "". The night club scene is in black and white, of course.",0
Shame on you Pendragon films! I regress. I want my money back! I hated it completely!,0
This is as good as film gets. The husband enters.,0
"The fourth of the series to be hospital - based, it's possibly the least of the genre. "" This is far from the late - 70s nadir, but Williams, James, Bresslaw, Maynard et al. Oh.",0
Okay!,0
This movie is a waste of time and money.,0
"In all, highly NOT RECOMMENDED!",0
Each character is shallow and has no personality. It isn't even scary.,0
"All in all I'd recommend for renting, but not for theater goers. A different look at horror.",0

"Best of all to be abandoned. "" Oh, the irony. Better still to forget.",0
No!,0
"It sort of reminded me of Silent Hill a few years back. This one, not so much.",0
I wish I had. Oh my god.,0
I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean. The story seems so boring.,0
"Take my advice, read the book and don't bother with this paltry version! Why do television adaptations do this? ?",0
"< br / > < br / > This version does not have the authentic, I - feel - like - I'm - there aspect of the A & E movie. In fact, there is no kissing until the end of the movie!!!! The way Lorna came into being with the Doones isn't true to original story.

Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone.,0
Ever. Movie.,0
"delivers a really good performance. I don't know how many movies build on a similar plot - most of them better, however. The killer ( of course! ) Sorry, not good.",0
Nothing very innovative.,0

There's not much middle ground in this category.,0
"Yes, his rendition of take on me is funny. This movie made me develop an eye twitch. Wanna know the only funny parts? Nothing else is.",0
"He comes back to the job, strung out on coke. Each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery. But then again, who did?",0
"The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. Bravo. < br / > < br / > The special effects were amazingly bad. I like bad films, as they are often the most entertaining. Of course, only half the movie contains acting.",0
"His facial expressions reflect life itself, in a way. The first watching will surely leave you with that strange ` Huh? However, Kattan is not just about comedy. Surprised the hell out of me, I can tell you that much.",0
"Direction must be the problem here. I mean, come on, 5 is average.",0
"Bad, not good.",0
But it isn't. Corky however gives the feeling that he is deliberately screwing up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh from audience.,0
"There is absolutely no diversity in Kattan's routine. Why is this film so bad? It is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb, slap stick humor.",0
There is no'second level'of wit riding over slapstick.,0
Let me start with what is actually good about this film. Or what? It's horrible. Save the $ 8.,0
"My vote is one ( awful ). The camera, framing, cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality. The shallow, tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste.",0

"The 20 July 1944 coup is proof there were significant efforts by the Germans to obtain peace. This is where the institutionalised agenda is relevant. During 1943 the Germans developed new jet fighters and jet bombers by companies including Arado, Heinkel and Messerschmitt. However, tens of millions of people had died since the allies abandoned the German resistance for their own greed. An accurate review of nuremburg must consider the door to history inadvertently opened with the movie "" valkyrie "" ( Tom Cruise ). """,0

"< br / > < br / > "" How could anyone wreak such havoc on his beloved city? "" He parades characters on the screen bereft of human decency.",0

"< br / > < br / > Good DP. This film is Lee's flaw. Over acting, to put it simply. Became irrelevant.",0
"Waste of film, I gave it 1 out of 10 : awful dud. Not thinking at all is my guess.",0
I had to walk out of the theater. < br / > < br / > No thanks.,0
This movie sucks! Sucks.,0
"Ya I rented it, so shoot me! In most cases this should be a slam dunk, but this little stinker derails quite quickly.",0
The whole film is amateur night. Wow! This IS NOT what the movie is billed as. The script is unintentionally funny.,0
"Horror movies can be a lot of fun with low budgets, bad acting, and a bit of panache. Spending forty - plus bloodless, droning minutes with them was more horrific than when the bloodshed started. < br Actually, it doesn't go anywhere.

It's unfortunate that you can't go any lower than one star.,0
This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb. You could probably for it show up on television.,0
Wow! Willow's a funny name.,0

"This is a mystery - everyone asks them "" how could you do that? "" Once you've set the bar so high, it's hard to up - it short of everyone committing suicide. Um, they haven't heard of the telephone? < br / > < br / > There are silly lapses in logic. and the audience is asking the same question.",0
"And so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank finale. The acting, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable.",0
That is the problem isn't?,0
It is below average really.,0
"The actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too. < br / > < br / > That's not to say Parasomnia is terrible, but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be.",0

"As Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie. Like I say, buried very deep. "".",0
Good for a laugh.,0
"It's the lack of imagination that one found in spades, for better or worse, in Paris J'taime.",0

"so don't see this movie. 3 / 10 so great, that seven horrible sequels had to be made.",0
I think there was some cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film. Then she shows the world that they do exist by transforming on live TV.,0
"Yes, the first "" Howling "" was a classic. It was set in London after all.",0
There is absolutely nothing scary about it. Yuck! It was a film to be taken seriously.,0
"I thought if it was that bad it would be awfully funny, but I was wrong. It makes the original'Howling'look like a masterpiece.",0
"Her arch - enemy is played by a seemly fatigue Christopher Lee. Ugly shot, poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to Joe Dante's 1981 classic. "" However, if you want a little substance or depth, you'll be sorely disappointed. which is pretty pathetic and pointless. The music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful. The dialogues are embarrassing and there's absolutely no tension to detect anywhere.",0
There's a lot of talent involved here.,0
"OK, as everyone has pointed out, this film is a complete dog. Others have mentioned Sybil Danning's tits. < br / > < br / > There are a couple of slightly good bits. < br / > < br / > Secondly, the werewolf costumes are the lamest you have ever seen. I actually quite liked the score. Shouldn't be too hard to put two and two together, hmm?",0
"They're terrible when you see them. A must - miss. Dreadful horror sequel to "" The Howling "".",0

"T. T. ','Telly Addicts,'Neighbours ', and'New Faces '. Rather than being amused by DeLane, you want to shoot him. In theory,'Director's Commentary'should have worked.",0
Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen!,0
Stefan is to do a small courier job.,0
Stefan dislikes what he sees and decide to help Elli out of her misery. See it and jugde for yourself.,0
He really did try.,0
"< br / > < br / > Seriously, avoid this film. Can Wayans whip these losers into shape?",0
< br / > < br / > It never happened.,0
The death knell is twofold.,0
"The other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world - - including a very unhappy couple. I respected what they tried but simply didn't like it very much. For a recent film, that was unusual in our more anti - smoking culture.",0
"It is a shame the MST3K guys never got hold of this movie. Many minutes pass in quietness, no one speaks, and few act. < br / > < br / > The plot is predictable. A husband murders his rich wife for her money. Uncanny really!",0
The dialogue is leaden. The film plays out rather like a film school graduate's attempt to emulate these masters. i. e. one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years.,0
"< br / > < br / > Tian Zhuangzhuang's film the'Blue Kite'was a far better film. I see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry. Not very impressed. < br / > < br / > If any film fits the description of'overrated,'this is it.",0
"3 from over 600 people. This film only got a 4 from me, but it has 7. Many of dialogues are slow and meaningless. It also has a high rating! The film can just be shorten to a few sentences.",0
Only Celia Johnson manages to do the character of the Nurse some justice.,0
And there you have your 120 minutes! It really doesn't stay focused on the New York magic. This was a movie i could not wait to see!,0
"< br / > < br / > - Let's start off with the good bit, shall we? I only wish that i could give this movie a rating of zero. Benvolio was unfeeling and mercilessly choppy with his lines. The rest of the actors needed to pull it together. Whoever cast him deserves to be punished.",0
His Capulet is well - played and a joy to watch. Anthony Andrews'Mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera.,0
Anthony Andrews... yikes!,0
< br / > < br / > And that's it. Tybalt then grabs the offended region. Celia Johnson is good as the Nurse. The opening brawl is notably incoherent. Awful.,0
Other than that I'd only recommend it to Hollywood muscial completist. The fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering.,0
"Why is the movie itself such a stupid bore? Gene Kelly and Vincente Minnelli, the team behind "" An American in Paris "", are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations. < br / > < br / > What happened along the way?",0
The accents were shameful.,0
"And who the heck decided to cut all of Meg's songs out of the movie? The movie looked more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland. ! But when I saw this, I was like, what the heck?! Who decided to do all of that?",0
Can fake scenery ruin a picture? No. Musicals did very well in the'50s. Part of it also was the dancing.,0
"Too many scenes out of context. Plus, the romantic side of viewers always enjoy a good love story. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy ; they're both great role models.",0
< br / > < br / > 1 out of 10 stars - this was awful! It was like bad outtakes from part one or something.,0
"I say this to you to warn you in advance that even if you are a fan of Walken's deadpan delivery and style or liked the original "" Prophecy "" that you will be sorely dissapointed. By end of the movie you're actually wishing he'd blow his horn and make the walls of Jericho fall on the people who made this un - natural disaster. < br / > < br / > What's wrong with this movie? If you buy it, return it. One gets the feeling we wander aimlessly from scene to scene just to move the film along to Walken's next big line.",0
2!,0
"Once again, the war between fallen and loyal Angels is brought to earth. I personally liked "" The Prophecy "" of 1995 a lot. Still, Walken's performance isn't only redeeming quality of the film.",0
The movie begins with Gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing War of Heaven here on earth.,0
"I think this movie should have been entitled, "" Who Stole the Sergeant's Gun? "" I'll leave it up to you to try it, but it'not one I'd strongly recommend. To me, it was a waste of good viewing effort and time.",0
The plot doesn't even make sense. This movie is lame and not funny at all.,0
HIGHLIGHT. This movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst.,0
Where exactly were they?,0
This is a portion of the plot which lends itself to scrutiny.,0
"Oh well, I'll stick to NBC's "" Today. "" She is very unprofessional. They're still a bit dull though. Hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity.",0
Don't rent this terrible movie.,0
Wisdom starts with knowing what you don't know. Please be tolerant of other people's opinion. Bad casting. Specially a case like this and this responsibility was not taken. < br / > < br / > And so on. There is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts. Why?,0
"Imagine that. ( I am a clinical psychologist. ) Instead, I will refer them to the book.",0
"This is crude, simplistic student politics made into drama. ... thankfully he hasn't, yet!",0
This might be amusing if you're high. I was wrong. The characters are flat. I recorded it again and watched it through.,0
"For me, there was no soul in the'NY'film. It wasn't all romantic. What I liked about'Paris'was the breakup of the neighborhoods.",0
Two old men sitting on a park bench. Why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths?,0
Not even'classic'film clips did much.,0
"As one reviewer here said, her role had nothing to do with the movie or book. It was an awful movie.",0
It's not good at all but I was never bored. An absolute disaster. Myron Breckinridge ( Rex Reed!!! ) ! Welch is actually not bad as Myra but her lines make no sense so you never know what to make of her.,0
"And, partly because of this, she seems to be in a different movie. Nevertheless, that tagline just about sums it up. John Carradine and Jim Backus, as Doctors, also amble in briefly.",0
"All characters, white plus a few token minorities, are one - dimensional, cardboard cutouts of people concepts. That's fine. My dissatisfaction is split : 30 % tone - deafness, 70 % lackluster writing. < br / > < br / > The 70 % is why everything falls short. ( I'll indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin. ) But romance is amazing, deep, sometimes complex.",0
"That's how Michael Sarne, director of this colossal flop, was able to get the job. They weren't inspiration, they were desperation.",0
"Also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the Fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals. < br / > < br / > Perhaps Sarne is not the only one to blame, however, as film's screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief.",0
"Bravo for debut performances! Upon seeing it, I think I have my answers. Throw in some old film footage of old stars, and the movie becomes even more disconnected. But, of course, arguably the most notorious role went to Mae west.",0
It's the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed. Oops. When it was finally released there wasn't the usual three ring circus of publicity.,0
My vote is three.,0
"The cast, sensing disaster, became increasingly combative. Rewrite upon rewrite followed. < br / > < br / > Gore Vidal's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement. < br / > < br / > The accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself.",0
This film was loathed from day one. Its intentions aren't honorable.,0
The worst thing about the movie is the actors.,0
This movie is as bad as bad films get. The other actors on screen could barely deliver their lines. The dire cut scenes.,0
Just forget about it! What a disappointing movie!,0
"Cinematography isn't great either. < br / > < br / > As usual, there are a number of sex scenes.",0
And Eileen Daly is just a lower rate Elvira.,0
"Everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page. You can take that figuratively or literally. Did Merchant Ivory put a hold on their casting calls? 50 ). Usually, I think people are too hard on directors and actors. This movie has quite a few bad ones. I can't exactly say I was ripped off.",0
"But hey, stunt men deserve their moment of glory always.",0
"I'm sorry to everyone who loved his work, but I unfortunately did not.",0
Wait a second...,0
Well that is all.,0
"A few weeks ago, I read the classic George Orwell novel, 1984. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen. - Brian O.",0
"A "" don't know how to do "" sex - in - - city. Just saw it yesterday in the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival.",0
I enjoyed every page.,0
However this is also where the movie is let down.,0
The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making. what does he do?,0
"he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances at people without immense fear. There was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book, and that is morphing characters. The terrifying thing about Big Brother is that, in a way, it has some points behind its philosophy. I think it was the latter.",0
I strongly recommend that you read the book.,0
A much lesser follow - up.,0
"in anti - military movies? Does it get any dumber than this? Anyone who has any idea at all about human nature will see right through this idiocy. Amazing. But this time the story has been lowered to the level of the dialog, too.",0
"Well I thought wrong. All of which are left entirely to the viewer. I wasn't really fond of the first "" Cube "" movie.",0
"This movie is repulsive, illogical and meaningless.",0
"You go girlfriend! Freedom from her servant role? Granted, these characters are amusing.",0
! but cube zero in comparison to it's predecessors really isn't worth sh * t!,0
"Unless you count "" Manos - Hand of Fate "" one of top ten movies EVER! someone please tell me... * sigh * Oh well.",0
Horrible.,0
This one is a bit different though.,0
"< br / > < br / > If this was a stand - alone b - movie, I'd probably give it about a four.",0
"film in the Cube series is part retread ( most of the booby traps are sadly recycled ), part aberration. And it stands perfectly well, on its own, without a stupid sequel like "" Cube Zero. "" Basically nothing.",0
Nevertheless there isn't a single original thing in this movie. The acting is so - so. Duh.,0
Really there is nothing much else to say about it.,0
Shocking!,0
I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. That's just flippin'stupid. The first Cube movie was an art movie.,0
It's not that the story does not have potential ; it's simply that the first Cube film never needed to be expanded on. It was also nicely self - contained.,0
the music was good throughout.,0
"Well, nope.",0
You can imagine where that leads.,0
Leonor Watling is also quite good.,0
The reference just dies somewhere in script. I think this is called wayward narrative pacing. who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets.,0
Barely above porn. ! From one movie lover to another.,0
"Otherwise, this movie was terrible.",0
"Whatever it is, here it's as bad as it gets.",0
No one else would cast him in anything. He can't act. Ryan Bauer is also hot.,0
< br / > < br / > Forget it! Unless you happen to enjoy Eddie's foul style.,0
"So why doesn't it work? And through it all Donna radiates warmth and understanding as perfect mother of a gay boy, etc. but the degree of acting is at an all time low.",0
"And to makes matters worse ( more boring ) most of deaths occur off - screen. No, it isn't CGI bugs and software companies.",0
It was cool then.,0
This movie is a prime example of squandering great resources in a film.,0
Kind of creepy.,0
"Notice how I didn't mention "" Tunnel Vision ""?",0
This means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Well most of the country was not stoned in the 70's.,0
Yes is is a bit puerile as well as dated.,0
!,0
What do all these people make up?,0
The entire story line is no where in the book. The music is too loud. It is clean. This is the worst one yet.,0
"Do not allow yourself to become too interested or engrossed '. Maybe it is just me, but I find this to be terribly distracting and downright irritating. This film's director chose to frequently use multi - angle camera shots simultaneously on the screen.",0
"That takes guts "". This just pisses me off. Why not then have a Dragon POV shot. Then released it. On the box cover, we see a picture of our hero, and the dragon.",0
"OK. Or, maybe, they'll hire a real director next time. - the action was fairly non stop, and, after a weak beginning, I got quite absorbed in the storyline. < br / > < br / > In spite of everything, I gave this flick a 4 out of 10.",0
""".",0
The acting is bad. All it looks like is a gray blob.,0
It is offensive to all the senses. They've been serviceable in their films. Parker and Stone have essentially whored themselves out. The film plays like a 90 minute episode of Family Guy. ... and not in a good way. Really it's sad.,0
"These things are funny to watch, however. There's even another dragon, which grew out of who knows what.",0
I'll watch for her again.,0

This is one to avoid.,0
"The acting, to begin with, is awful, awful, awful.",0
2 is probably fair. Sort of mindless fun.,0
HA HA! Or even decent movies.,0
If I could give this a zero or minus rating I would.,0
"Perhaps if you see Shinobi alone, you could like it. I gave this movie a 5 out of pure pity. But the story is nothing like the original one.",0
"Poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death. Wow. Don't make that mistake. They may share similar endings, but that's where similarities end. """,0
"That's not stubbornness... that's just plain dumb. "" Nope. < br / > < br / > Fine, fine! THE END for that character. They kill each other because the emperor says so.",0
Some good ideas - not more.,0
The story itself should have been handled much better. This has to be some of the worst direction I've seen.,0
dont watch this its awful. Listen to cd.,0
"Why did they have Gammon's character? No explanation as to why she was moved, or when it was done! !",0
"This is one of the best and entertaining TV commercials produced to date. Do not discount the success of using heavy - weight opera singers. She was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953. Surely, today, this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making. < br / > < br / > Larry The color ink has faded much and that can not be helped. I suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early Sofia Loren film.",0
See the difference?,0
I've never understood the appeal of Garbo.,0
It seems a shame that Greta Garbo ended her illustrious career at the age of 36 with this ridiculous mistaken - identity marital romp.,0
"I wish he had more lines, as he disappeared in the second half of the story. It's an annoying story. Also, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon look so young. That was amazing and humorous footage.",0
Ignore this if it ever airs on TV. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini but that's about it.,0
"Oh, and Bad people happen to Good people.",0
"< br / > < br / > The view beyond Susan's heinie, it must be said, is not very compelling. Nope.",0
"Rather, see the 2001 version of Bartleby featuring Crispin Glover. It tells the story, almost painfully so.",0
Come on! And the 20th century?,0
Even in jest.,0
But it falls apart in the middle.,0
I went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son.,0
Much of the rest of the film seems thrown - together.,0
It was impossible to remain engaged with this film. It is a shocking bad effort coming from a major studio.,0
"Its a film to forget, and forget quickly.",0
"A sick,leazy film. YUCK!",0
"I'm rambling, and worse yet, making the movie sound somewhat interesting.",0
"This film, and another, "" RED ASPHALT "", is certainly reality in its most graphic form. Incredibly, most of them later said "" I never knew a car accident could be so terrible! """,0
"It's tedious and looks like a student film. What a waste of energy! The Cowboy and the Frenchman "" is just plain silly. "" I couldn't wait to see it.",0
"Oh, yeah. I've never liked this show, and I never will.",0
Seeing one show a year showed that to me.,0
The storyline was stupid.,0
"Overall gross was $ 261K, which I'd doubt could cover cast and crew's hotel and food for a week on location. < br / > < br / > Being curious, I checked this site's production info. And Charlize Theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see, even if it showed her watching paint dry.",0
Yuck. Terrible.,0
Unfortunately Brady doesn't show much comedic flair but you can't lay all the blame on him. The only person who actually isn't to bad is Richardson. Candy and Lonnie admit their affair and now the whole trip is in chaos. But Roy phones his doctor in Arkansas and finds out that he's sterile.,0
Not a lot of twists this one.,0
I give this a 1. This ( predictably ) bombed. See the 1937 Stanwyck version instead.,0
"Frankly, I'd rather go listen to my Kitchens of Distinction catalogue than watch this again. yaayyyyy!!!! I don't buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine. If it smells like... and it looks like... well, you know the rest. < br / > < br / > Avoid like plague.",0
It was not very well cast either.,0
Disgraceful.,0
"It wasn't. But frankly, I just found it bad. These weren't characters, they were stereotypes.",0
"Old - style real men in action, here.",0
"( vomiting, farting,.. Then the 1990s came.",0
I'm still traumatized.,0
"The funniest character was probably Laura Prepon though, she's not in the movie very much. 3 / 10 a below average teen comedy that's worth skipping. Rating 4. This is directed by Dewey Nicks and this is his first film so you can't blame him too much.",0
"< br / > < br / > This gets no more than one out of ten from me. < br / > < br / > All in all, the only thing I liked was James (. YUCK!!!",0
"A total waste of everyone's time. The premise was O. K, but the plot itself was terrible.",0
Save your money.,0
But aren't they all used?,0
AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I only laughed once and not even that hard.,0
"3 / 10 Besides that, avoid this movie.",0
"Angela falls for David, Ethan intentionally screws everything up, the good guys win.",0
But the all thing looks even more ridiculous than Luchini and its fake trees. ).,0
"One is almost tempted to say'Come back Godard, all is forgiven but even this woeful production can't make me utter those words.",0
"The movie has only one flaw, unfortunately this flaw damages all credibility of the piece. It fails to address the reason Israelis are there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel.",0
"A propaganda film for the Palestinian "" cause "".",0
"D'oh! ) Then you had the creepy child actor, the creepier Billy Barty, and so on. Donald Sutherland is just icky.",0
"undemanding role of pursuer. Poor old Sylvester would be forced to appear alongside Speedy for many years to come. His personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable. Friz Freleng's'Speedy Gonzalez'was the second cartoon to feature the title character after Robert McKimson's'Cat - tails for Two '. Despite looking significantly more handsome, Speedy never developed into much of a character.",0
But that alone doesn't make a movie.,0
It was pathetic. ?,0
"Throughout this film I was thinking "" Where is this going? "" < br / > < br / > I love films. I appreciate 99. and suchlike. Just "" My GOD. "" I was sadly mistaken.",0

"Fortunately for the actors, hopefully they will be able to erase this from their resumes.",0
"Neither can pull off the smarmy, snooty rich - kid attitude that the original actors did. Overall, this movie was a waste of time.",0
zero.,0
There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. : Spoilers : < br / > < br / > I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy.,0
"God damn them, the maniacs! ! Sweet Weeping Jesus, the memories... sometimes they come back to me.",0
I didn't honestly care what happened to any of them. I was not impressed.,0
Which must not have happened. They for sure didnt do any in this movie. Well 1 minute into this movie i was disappointed. I am using this term although i dont know why. It didnt work though.,0
< br / > < br / > As a prequel this is fairly lame.,0
"He just doesn't have the charisma Ryan did. Not that he is a bad actor, he's good.. You'll want to pass this one. As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice.",0
I was mad anyone made this movie.,0
! It was an absolute masterpiece. She is terrible. And i loved the first one so much.,0
Lena Endre was good looking as always.,0
The reasons why are many.,0
"There he decides to make a fresh start and just a life a normal life and settle down. There are so many problems with the film. co. uk'a randy version of Saved by the Bell '. The film also had a major problem of sexualised 15 / 16 - years - old. Cruel Intentions 2 is bloody awful, I mean uber - bad.",0
I can't believe they'd make third one.,0
None. Just don't.,0
She is nothing!,0
"More like Joshua Jackson. There isn't one decent scene. What? The guy playing Sebastian sucks, too.",0
"1 10 If not, avoid at all costs. The acting is mostly horrendously bad. ... or maybe it just IS this bad.",0
It is worse than Krull.,0
It shouldn't be that obvious. This must be one of the worst Swedish movies ever made.,0
The truth hurts.,0
).,0
"! Still, I don't fault him.",0
The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. He completly DIES and I kept cringing while watching Sellers performance. Ok so here's the basic plot.,0
"Indeed, the movie employs racist insults. < br / > < br / > And then there's Peter Sellers.",0
and The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu is certainly no exception.,0
"It is a VERY good - looking movie. And that's what FIENDISH PLOT is. At all. Having Burt Kwouk ( of whom his master says, "" Your face - - is familiar. """,0
These characters also kept me watching.,0
This is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD. Impressive!,0
It's too bad she had such little air time. I tried to like this program ; I really did.,0
"With Ben & Arthur, you do just that. < br / > < br / > No matter, Sam.",0
"It's a home movie! In fact, the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie. Even direct to DVD films should have production values better than this! !",0
"It opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities. We can never re - pay you enough. "" I couldn't contain myself during the nude scene.",0
Phew - - I don't what to say.,0
Everything. You don't make sense!,0
You don't make sense! It must be seen to be believed. Hilarious.,0
The two should have switched roles. Pines yes - palms no.,0
Sort of the Mendoza line for film. Congratulations you horrible little man. The worst of it all is Sam Mraovich himself.,0
"He is to be pitied. This was innocently my first viewing of his "" work ""... and it will my last. Ed Wood looks awfully good to me right now. Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again.",0
< br / > < br / > The actors (? ) Ben & Arthur is one of the worst movies ever made. Just like in real life.,0
Ben and Arthur has beaten both.,0
Nothing looks rehearsed. The film quality is terrible.,0
"The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable, the ones that ain't, is just plain boring. "".",0
"I mean, it looks exactly like that. This movie does not even deserve a 1. A 1. My god was I wrong.",0
"This film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry. No, I'm not joking. Cheese. Holy crap this movie was bad.",0
So what was so wrong with BEN AND ARTHUR?,0
! But it ISN'T.,0
This film was the worst film I have ever viewed.,0
"you just had to laugh, and in the wrong places. Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10.",0
"Presumably they could only afford to travel in steerage. The story is convoluted, and the production is amazingly sloppy.",0
Bad?,0
"I cheered! Very sadly humorous. "". < br / > < br / > Story? Don't get me started. And, I did learn one thing from this "" film. What acting?",0
It was certainly no contest for Disney that year if this was their only competition.,0
Then why oh why is it so bad? Hence I really wanted to like this film.,0
"It is slow, boring and bordering on pointless.",0
"The result is cathartic. I am going to use all of them. "" < br / > < br / > This is what Jean Yeo is trying not to achieve. If they sound good to me, they will sound good to the audience.",0

Randolph Scott is leaving the USA for the greener pastures of Canada's British Columbia. They stampede their small herd over a toll bridge erected by Victor Jory.

It's pretty clear that the director and production crew set out to paint a less than flattering picture of the Palestinian girl and her family.

"He never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie. Mabel has been committed, because, frankly, she's nuts. Out of her damn mind. His daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation, and the thing you want to do is keep her calm, and he goes nuts over spaghetti? Crazy.",0
Her parents don'thing in her life for her. Nick's mom is adamant about having Mabel committed.,0

Thats where it got disturbing. Oh and as a note Rosario Dawson still did great job. But if you choose to watch it just don't be unsuprised.

"That brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a pure coincidence. Still I'm sure 1930 audiences shuddered. Starbuck and Stubbs might as well be Smith and Jones. Of course this was all before the Code.",0
