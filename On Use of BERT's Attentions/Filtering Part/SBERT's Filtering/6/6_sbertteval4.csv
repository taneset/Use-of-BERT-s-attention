I was wrong. The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions.,1
"Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period - piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century. Once the action moves to the U. S. Open things pick up very well. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players'heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive here. Despite the formulaic nature, this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience.",1
"< br / > < br / > Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed.",1
"< br / > < br / > This is one I'd recommend to anyone. I saw this film in a sneak preview, and it is delightful. He does a marvelous, self - contained, job as the lead. Sports movies are a dim a dozen, but this one stands out.",1
Heartland gave that award to this film.,1
He lies on the grass coming down from ( during? ) and that would make it a little biased. Huh?,1
"Soon he's "" cool "" actor, idolized by youth. "" He says "" I had to get high to do what director wanted. "" The perfect recipe for his enablers. So, his shallow identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. He was hot in the early nineties. """,1
It changed my life. lol. I Give It Threehumbs Way Up! I just saw it on the Ifc channel. I loved this movie from beginning to end.,1
I was in tears by the end of the film. Every scene was mesmerizing.,1
But it really was a worth while watch. I first saw this movie on IFC. This movie did all those things to me and more. There are NO loopholes ( in my opinion ).,1
It shows the genuineness of the movie.,1
< br / > < br / > A must see for someone in mental health profession!,1
The music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after. < br / > < br / > Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some Chinese action films late eighties start nineties. Later you can see him in great films such as Frozen and Suzhou River. We really feel pain and struggle Jia is in. I saw this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002. So does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film.,1
"7 out of 10 and that's being kind. Night of the Hunted "" stars French porn star Brigitte Lahaie. Give it a look only if you are a fan of Jean Rollin'works. """,1
"For once, there's not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight!",1
I was surprised how much I enjoyed this.,1
Very metropolitan. I was really impressed.,1
"I like this one a lot, check it out. 8 out of 10. Except it's in French with subtitles of course.",1
"< br / > < br / > Once there, Felix barges into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself. That's because despite its age, the cartoon is very creative and funny. In gratitude, the guy gives Felix $ 500! Hurray!",1
"The independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger.",1
Most highly recommended.,1
"My kingdom for a ham sandwich!!! "" He's in tears. Crazy stuff.",1
"They appeared as a couple in seven previous films. Indeed, Sheridan was a lieutenant at this point.",1
"If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress. So I guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.",1
This is what I considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable. Custer ranked 34 in a graduating class of... 34. the cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroic.,1
I was in tears by the end of the film. Every scene was mesmerizing.,1
"Ford taught us in "" Liberty Valance "" to believe the legend before the truth.",1
( or Jeb ) Stuart ; Errol took on the Custer part for THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON.,1
Warner's DVD is pretty nice looking. He literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts heart of his loyal heroine.,1
Arthur Kennedy never more villainous. It had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout.,1
Loosen up!,1
"The script, at times, was corny, although the movie was still enjoyable to watch. Her character will definitely make you laugh. Their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance. Others will watch this movie and learn hate him. The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era.",1
"< br / > < br / > 3 ) Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. I half - expected to see the Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello wander into the scene. Just having someone like Errol Flynn play Custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production. < br / > < br / > 5 ) Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored. And for the most part my expectations were fulfilled ( in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way ).",1
So keira knightly is in it... < br / > < br / > GO ON!! give it a go! So automatically we compare this film to attonement.,1
"this is awesome!!! there is no partnership quite like Errol, and Olivia. patriotic, for all the right reasons.",1
"Through an error, Custer receives a promotion in rank. < br / > < br / > Errol Flynn dominates each scene in which he appears. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero.",1
During that time she was the custodian of the Custer legend. I'm not sure they ever met.,1
! < br / > < br / > I'll give this film 10 out of 10!,1
"This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10. John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it. ), and national hero.",1
When first you hear rain on a roof? Can you capture the moment? The lives of four friends. A simple biopic could have missed the point. The things that matter. Vera. The purity of their former passion.,1
"The movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate, and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say, JFK.",1
Is there a way out of the madness? You will both be cheerio pronto.,1
"if you like "" Who's That Girl? """,1
< br / > < br / > This film mistaken.,1
She'the girl for me.,1
"is not a deep film. Haviland Morris also stars. But Who's That Girl? Overall, a delight! I've watched it when I was younger.",1
! The soundtrack is excellent too.,1
In this TV special Jon is the one who needs a life.,1
Oh well.,1
"Madonna gets into action, again and she fails again! At the end, it's very funny to watch it.",1
"And Madonna can act. But it's their problem, not of the film.",1
"Clear. "" ), plays an attorney for his fiancée's father ( John McMartin ). "" When she gets out she decides to seek revenge. < br / > < br / > Griffin Dunne ( whatever happened to him?",1
Her acting is superb! ! I love this movie! * ALANiS Rocks *. It's classic.,1
[ CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! ] Literally. Jon and Garfield attend the class. No avail. Jon sat next to a pretty girl named Mona.,1
Hilarious! < br / > < br / > Madonna is the queen of deadpan acting.,1
!,1
Madonna - bashing is so 90's. ? Give her a break!,1
6 /.,1
He'very good in a small role as Bracco's pimp. The whole cast is wonderful.,1
I hope it lasts.,1
I would credit this to two very charismatic people. I know I did.,1
Technical details?,1
< br / > < br / > There were lots of BABES in and out of bikinis. It is pure 100 % adolescent fun. Is this a bad movie?,1
Watch it twice if you can.,1
"As time goes on at home, the evil Stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls. An easy 10 / 10. It has twist, turns, and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense. The soundtrack is faultless, the furnishings in the house, and the use of colour are fantastic. Or ANY sort of movie fan! Silence follows.",1
It's a hell of a puzzle.,1
Very creepy!,1
It is not a perfect film. Very little.,1
So I'll just leave it at that. With the characters nicely fleshed out. I was really surprised at the depth of this movie.,1
! Then they made a movie out of it.,1
the characters are extremely believable. i would definitely look out for this on DVD. i love horror movies that revolve around a house.,1
It's actually typical with Korean and Japanese movies. ). Don't miss!,1
"But you never can. To most of us, life is an unfolding process of love. Soo - mi says "" Do you know what's really scary?",1
"Three words : Piece of Art. Said, done. This film is just great. It was so sad.",1
"Some things will still be open to interpretation, and this is one of joys of watching a film such as this. This movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror, but not for obvious reasons. Indeed, it would be a mistake to align "" A Tale Of Two Sisters "" with films like "" Ringu "" and "" The Grudge "".",1
Every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie. And don't forget to switch the light off.,1
!,1
A beautiful short film.,1
"The tension rises and there is the inevitable snap. Many horror fans complain that horror has scarcely progressed in the last twenty years. One to watch again and again, if only to work it all out.",1
My vote is eight.,1
"Eun - joo ( YEOM Jeong - ah ) welcomes them but Su - mi's manner is bitter to her. says he angrily, "" Su - mi, please. < br / > < br / > Listening to their talk, the brother's wife has a panic. Eun - joo pulls Su - yeon into a wardrobe and locks her in it. Give me a break. """,1
"< br / > < br / > Highly recommended viewing in my opinion, real joy and scare...",1
"I just saw "" A Tale of Two Sisters "" last night and really enjoyed it. The initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of Su - Mi. < br / > < br / > Here's my interpretation of the film.",1
"It'quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable. In reality, however, nothing could be further from the truth.",1
"A Tale of Two Sisters "" is a terrific movie - adventure and a definite must see for Asian film fanatics. Several sequences ( like the dinner with relatives or the nightly appearance in the girls'room ) are pretty much ultimate in eeriness. It's also a film that requires repeated viewing, even though no one will never really "" get it "" for a full 100 %. Well, this blunt opinion doesn't go for the South Korean gem "" A Tale of Two Sisters "". This is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terror - tale that REALLY gets under your skin!",1
"There are only four main characters, but the intrigue surrounding them is intense. The Guilt. The best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it.",1
Hehehe.,1
"My rating : 10 out of 10. The plot is slightly confusing, but some scenes are wonderful eerie. "" Watch this masterpiece as soon as possible.",1
"Viewing on a good screen and with a good 5. Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here. The ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can cope.",1
"It is a real gem, worthy of anyone's collection. < br / > < br / > I truly love this film. ' I will certainly be looking into their other films. These two girls were magical on screen.",1

A worthwhile moodpiece.,1
""".",1

Radio had a great mix of comedy and drama.,1
I know people like these. I loved it. you won't find it in this movie.,1
"RAdio. """,1
Gooding flawless. Radio is an inspiration. Ed Harris was his usual brilliance. This movie is a real life fairy tale and not to be missed.,1
"Just a lot of nudity and silly dialog. ""... "" I can see you better naked!",1
"< br / > < br / > Cuba Gooding, Jr. is excellent as Radio! It has a life lesson, specially showing us how a person can make a difference, even not being what we call'' normal''. Ed Harris is great as Harold Jones, but this actor IS great, so this is not anything new. One day, Cash decides to punish James, mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up.",1
"Debra Winger, only has a few scenes in the film. Michael Tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man. < br / > < br / > The supporting cast is excellent.",1
I think there was a lot of realism with the characters.,1
"Gooding does a nice job with the role, too. The story takes place in the mid 1970s in South Carolina.",1
"< br / > < br / > Debra Wing, we need more of you in pictures! Very well done to all. 7 out of 10.",1
"The next day, I went off to Blockbuster and bought the DVD. He let me borrow it and I watched it in my room. Corniness Warning. He's got his own collection. It was for Radio.",1
It deserves nothing less! I definitely give this movie a 10.,1

The marines let principles be damned. I sat riveted to the TV screen. Anne Heche was utterly convincing. Totally believable. But this movie brought fear to my heart.,1
I give the movie a 9 out of 10.,1
Absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene. It very excellent none the less. 8 out of 10.,1

Yes Doris Day. It elevated the film to another level. And the assassin was truly frightening.,1
4!,1
"The film has a lot going for it. Is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? They sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen. While the footage rolls, Al and Annie start making out. Ridiculous.",1
"It's Hitchcock - light, but recommended.",1
Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world famous singer. Hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.,1
).,1
"I prefer it over "" Vertigo "" and "" Rear Window. """,1
Sorry.,1
< br / > < br / > My Score : 8 / 10.,1
You'll see what I mean. I loved little bit of comedy at the end that Alfred added.,1
A fine film.,1
A worthwhile moodpiece.,1
It isn ' The scene ends with Stewart rushing out the door. The kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet.,1
"Neither film is a big deal, but both are easy to enjoy.",1
James Stewart is marvelous.,1
"Rating : better than average, Hitchcock'enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy it. The story was ferociously reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining. In a bus they know a sympathetic French person ( Daniel Gelin, in the old version Pierre Fresnay ). Then the child is abducted to ensure their silence and McKenna gets help to Morocco's Inspector Buchanan ( Ralph Truman ).",1
"Luckily, there is a creepy assassin in the form of Reggie Nalder.",1
This movie is very good. He is killed at the marketplace after finding out the information he sought. It is hard to find a problem about it.,1
"By contrast, all of Stewart's masculine activity is counterprod < br / > < br / > After their son has been kidnapped, Stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news. This seems to be a mutual decision, and she doesn't appear to be unhappy. She sings!",1
I thought there was nothing fake about her performance.,1
His wife is the lovely Doris Day at her best.,1
Gail Osborne is new in town. But the Goodtimes version is pretty crappy.,1
"While there, they meet a French man on the bus and another middle - aged couple in a restaurant. That being said, this remake, although definitely better, still isn't among Hitchcock's best work. < br / > < br / > The original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic Peter Lorre.",1
Stewart and Day play off each other beautifully in that scene. Their child is snatched in order to insure their silence. The original film was shot inside a studio.,1
"They feature great animation and taut, fast - moving plots.",1

"Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent, as was the rest of the cast.",1

It's a target.,1
Tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. Tan as lead is nothing less than magnificent.,1
Hand of Death is not Jackie and Sammo's usual kung fu comedy.,1
"This movie is an evolutionary piece - from Terminator to Robocop. < br / > < br / > Pam Grier stars in this film as an hired killer - commando, a cheap role of the likes she was doing so much of during the 80's. < br / > < br / > Stan Winston did the SPFX!",1
fun film! this film always kept me interested.,1
"WESTERN UNION qualified on both requisites. Included in thismörgåsbord of titles is today's lucky subject, WESTERN UNION ( 20th Century - Fox, 1941 ).",1
But who did it? If it comes on TV watch it.,1
"His forte was drama - - and I guess this movie is a drama of sorts - - just set in the old West. So, it's up to either Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day.",1
At very least this is damned good western! This is a sort of hidden gem.,1
"Shaw ends up helping Creighton on his way to civilization, then disappears.",1
I give it a double A +.,1
Western Union is solid western entertainment. They both provide some good comic relief. Later on he's hired by Western Union and works for Jagger.,1
The movie in no way resembles the novel. Something just resonates with them. That film is Northwest Passage.,1
"The Frank James movie equals "" Jesse James "". "" Ms. Gilmore had a short career in movies.",1
Randolph Scott gives another magnificent performance with a great cast.,1
"He was hanged in the 1870s. However, MacLane makes him a memorably evil, and totally vicious type. At least, that is how audiences would see it. But Lang is responsible for that, as well as other touches.",1
"Her presence here is merely cosmetic. He died in 1998 at the age of 91. He just looks plain silly going up against Barton McLane in a gunfight! It beggars belief! Western Union "" is something of a forgotten classic western!",1
"But it'entertaining enough for a repeat view. Well, maybe.",1
And it's held up quite well over the years.,1
"But it's plain to see that if humans left them alone, Nightbreed in turn not bother with them. < br / > < br / > Back in the old days, the folks who inhabit Midian would have been called Zombies, the undead. She tries in her own small way to be a bridge to humankind. < br / > < br / > Clive Barker's creatures are a pretty gruesome looking lot and are not particularly fond of humans.",1
"Ha! This was only Anne Bobby'third film, and she was good also. Nothing spectacular, but fair.",1
"7 out 10. And without that, nada.",1
The film'Nightbreed'is one of the best horror films I have ever seen.,1
I experienced Nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with the results. ).,1
"Boone however, goes into Midian and make the claim that he's one of the mutants there. Lori saves a mutant from the sun, and in return helps the others as well. Rating 3. But a mutant named Peloquin ( Oliver Parker ) sees Boone as meat!",1
Whenever I watch it I find something new. He ends up with a card stuck to his chest. It was very interesting. It simply isn't. I will give that this movie could have been better.,1
Two thumbs up Clive. This movie was made for Barker fans.,1
One is. I absolutely love this movie.,1
"While the monsters, are human and prey. It's a horror story alright. ).",1
"I was not let down. "" This IS Clive Barker at his finest.",1
what can I say.... after that they were kept in a safe!!! Highly recommended.,1
I enjoyed this film.,1
"The visual are good, and in some shots great. As good as Scheffer is, Cronenberg is even better.",1
There it is. I like the way Barker simply presents it. Always has. I love love love love it. His novels tend to wander a bit. And fantasy just isn't my bag. The way the mask talked to him and controlled him.,1
"But Boone isn't dead. It's odd for a horror film to be this well done. The bite causes him to live, and he goes off to Midian.",1
"< br / > < br / > Great supporting performances add to the fun. Craig Sheffer plays Boone, a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer. It's colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in. Barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters. There'even a cool cameo by 50's and 60's sci - fi star John Agar.",1
"The make - up is awesome, the story is lovely.",1
About fantasy!,1
"And, not to forget, a nice music score. An amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book.",1
"It also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by Barker. In this one, the monsters ( the night breed of the title ) are the "" good "" guys. Worth look!",1
"Is he making it up or are they real and calling to him? Nightbreed turns genre on it's head. His Pyschologist ( Chroneburg ) convinces him he's a murderer, a slayer of families.",1
"Summing that moral up is simple, even though it is not quite that simply displayed ; prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different. < br / > < br / > All in all, this is a great movie, provided that you don't expect it to be a standard horror movie. I'm not sure they are entirely to blame for their rickety appearance and lack of depth, though, seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to screenplay.",1
There was great acting in it too. This movie is one of my favorites.,1
This is a movie with lasting effect. This is a story of a long and awkward love.,1
The storyline of The Milkwoman is a simple one of unrequited love that despite the passing of decades still remains strong. The director handles this marvellously with a strong structure and visual style.,1
"There's no eye contact, save for cursory glances by chance, and little acknowledgement of each other's existence.",1
"Minako and Kaita were high school sweethearts who, courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents, separated ways since then. Such unhurried development may not suit viewers weaned on fast - paced narratives but for the rest, it's a heartfelt introspection that affects powerfully and emphatically.",1
The climactic sequence is also really forced.,1
"A classic in the real sense of the word. Moreover, this one has a Motown soundtrack.",1
You want a movie that'll take you places? Well this is a good pick.,1
"Their loss - this is a fine, fine film.",1
Watch it and see. Does he ever get his wish?,1
The hits just kept coming.,1
"But thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher ( SNL's Garrett Morris ) they are released. Both of these boys have promising futures. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The police pursue them and they are arrested. 'which aired on ABC from 1976 - 1979.",1
Highly recommended.,1
"It is a lot of fun as well!! Cooley High "" is one of my favorite movies EVER!!! ! Get the soundtrack, too.",1
I was 4 years old at the time and saw it at a drive - in theatre. I'm glad that I was around to witness some of the goings on of era.,1
"Boys 2 Men, however, named their hit record after this film. It's an embarrassing disgrace.",1
10 out of 10. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! This film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess.,1
"If you're part of that remaining 1 %, however, you're in for a really unique treat. It's all a matter of profiling and good marketing, I guess. Just he starts to believe in actual love, she strikes back with a vengeance.",1
"You may not know this film just yet, but trust me, once seen you'll never forget it!! !",1
"So, pseudo serious and sexually free.",1
"The music, by Stelvo Cipriani is gnarly too, perfectly suited to the images.",1
"< br / > < br / > The climax to Episode 1 Season 1 reappears in an expanded form. One chunk is lifted directly from Season 1, namely Bill and Eddie going to the Club pretending to be on'union business '. The film is by and large episodic. The thing is, can Bill and Eddie stay friends long enough to win it? That's the main part of the plot.",1
"There were 41 reviews, average 5 stars.",1
"There is much running down corridors, stairways, through doorways, into elevators etc. High marks for art design! It can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love, like Puck in a "" Mid - summer Night's Dream "". After four collisions it ceases to have any impact, if you'll excuse the pun. However a kiss or two soon makes him feel better.",1
She gives him also no love but only stability.,1
A classic French film. ).,1
be prepared to be confused.,1
At the centre is Vinz Cassell's portrayal of Max. He has presence and diversity in abundance.,1
?,1
A little cult!,1
"The theme from Peter Chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script. The plot from Gilles Mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires. Only the French are capable of such tantalisation. To give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair. Hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending. As Lucien, Jean - Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotional. Even his clever denouement has you guessing. For me this is simply a haunting, elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web.",1
It also deserves some deeper thinking : how much is real in a game of relationship?,1
!,1
I will doubtless see it many more times. The film is ultimately'made'by Romane Bohringer. This is one of the most brilliant French films ever made.,1
The ending lends a cynical touch. Thus he tries to find Lisa. There are many layers to this movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > Ah, the story! Huge search here! ), devil (? ) A lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written! You can suffer a lot when you are in love!",1
"And she is right, of course. Max did not know, that Lisa had left and why. < br / > < br / > Acting is simply great. This one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details. Come on! L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique.",1
This is a fabulous film.,1

And it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot.,1
"As for George, I would praise Shalhoub. And between Martin Sheen & Sinsise as Tom, I would say Sinise wins.",1
"It's primarily at the coach's house, however. They proved their worth here.",1
They have all met for a reunion.,1
< br / > < br / > Highly Recommended.,1
"It is a character driven, enthralling film with a strong cast and some very good performances. Sound a bit too heavy?",1
Recommended. A very worthwhile viewing.,1
"It happened. Subtlety, finesse, charm are not easy to find in his films - - melodrama brims in them. The film's subject is poignant and very real. He fails in every department as a director except perhaps that he succeeds in getting some above - average performances from his actors.",1
"Then they should be asked - How normal do they feel? This movie is violent, powerful and thought provoking.",1
Survived long enough to see her story made into a movie at least. But the screenplay is patchy. The music is apt.,1
That one you can get from your local library.,1
This is a very hilarious short.,1
> : - ],1
Essential Stooge short to be honest. A professor? At least he wasn't as bad as Joe Besser.,1
( The skill of current day Australian & Irish actors taking on non - native dialects is amazing. ) The storyline is fully consistent with Richard Rhodes'definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb.,1
"Moe asks. """,1
"Shemp is great, he's funny, he's silly, he's SHEMP!",1
There is a catch. He has to marry someone that day by 6 o'clock.,1
Only Vernon Dent is missing. Ginger Grey.,1
"Every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action. Simply watch, laugh and enjoy! How many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery?",1
Moe is no slouch either.,1
"It was a truly amazing, uncripted show.",1
But it did. wazi. You have so much fun.,1
The attention to detail is uniformly excellent throughout. Highest recommendation.,1
Even the FBI inspector acts as if he would like to get something on the Jews. The townspeople are filled with prejudice. < br / > < br / > Memorably done and well worth viewing. This is how his role appears.,1
Well Recommended!,1

"< br / > < br / > One more thing. Babette's Feast "" is the same type of thing.",1
"The only weak point is the leading man, Dennis Morgan.",1

They live on salt cod and black bread gruel.,1
Impossible to improve or ignore.,1
"The photography is wondrously well executed. A gentle story, hinting at fury, with a redemptive message and glorious celebration.",1
< br / > < br / > I laugh out loud and cry each time I watch this film France!. An acting master class - not in the dialogue but body language.,1
Possibly the best international film of the 1980 '. They are now old and their life and beauty spent. The life in the village is simple and the stark direction reflects that.,1
"This movie is almost unknown, but it is very good. An Oscar totally deserved. The love between humans has awaken. All neighbourhoods are invited ( all fanatically puritans ). A good lottery prize lets her organize a great banquet, following the best rules of French gastronomy. However, the seductive force of the delicious meal they eat, that they become seduced by the sensuality of French gastronomy.",1
"She spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist. Indeed, she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them.",1
"I'm no chef, but I was impressed! < br / > < br / > The meal - Babette's feast - was amazing. < br / > < br / > In any case, it's a fine film, but don't watch this if you'dieting.",1
This movie came aside as a shock in the eighties.,1
"< br / > < br / > What But as the titles rolled, it became clear that this was no ordinary movie. Jutland ( where it's set ) is not Africa ; the chill mist that collects on the camera shots is not inviting.",1

There's absolutely no effort in lightning. Chole Nicholle delivers the best performance of the female cast.,1

"I read the book first and then watched the DVD later. That's pity. The story was well plotted and interesting by itself. To avoid that, I am not going to talking the story here. The film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book. It really worth watching.",1
I had no idea what I was about to see. They are very unusual in a period drama. I No doubt we'll see more of her.,1

It'not boring but there are times when I wished it would end.,1
"The camera work also suits the film. But, be brave - have the guts to go and see it. The key to the characters of both mother and daughter is'obsession.",1

"Stanwyck can't. This is Jefferson Jones ( Dennis Morgan ), sailor.",1
"Why does she receive sexual pleasure from pain? Next to the razor blade scene, that disturbed me most. The student's mother is not much more sympathetic than she. Then why the hateful attitude towards everyone? First of all, those who are faint at heart should definitely avoid this film.",1
"While grounded in reality, much of what Erika ( Huppert ) does can be viewed as emotional metaphor.",1

< br / > < br / > Easily recommended ; 10 out of 10.,1
See it now! The story is very well written. He's amazingly natural. What can I say about Kramer vs. Kramer?,1
But there's not much else to complain about here.,1
"KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars, including Best Picture of 1979. Robert Benton's incisive screenplay presents us flawed, but real human beings with hearts, souls, and brains. Hoffman is at the top of his form here.",1
This is a phenomenal movie.,1
It appeared as a very kind film to me. Luckily nothing happened to Nestor.,1
"( Yikes! First, I loved the documentary. It is a remarkable bait and switch. The dogs are family, the workers are family.",1
"Also nominated was Jane Alexander for her fantastic turn as the Kramer's good friend Margaret. They grow together, come to know each other and form entirely new and wonderful relationship.",1
Around 7½ out of 10.,1
They met in a corner café. He had a great job and a loving wife. Ted was distraught. It did however affect his performance as a father. And that He blew up when Billy spilled punch on his client artwork!,1
Remember Joe Flairty crying.,1
"< br / > < br / > 10 / 10. Put simply, a perfect film.",1
I think that this is what what made the film good.,1
"Hoffman is in his prime in this role : his first Oscar win after three other notable nominations. Kramer vs. Kramer "" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so troubling. Streep does so effortlessly.",1
"He got a lot of laughs. Polite, patient, genial. SM This is unusual in France - laughing aloud. the one from a communist village in Languedoc.",1
"The story was strongly emotional, but is not saturated with such.",1
< br / > < br / > The custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance.,1
This movie is also revealing.,1
"Hoffman's a career oriented man in the advertising game. She also wants out of being a mother, at least for a while. At that point after over a year, Streep decides she wants custody.",1
"Streep's character is designed to be a cold, self - centered witch, but I was ready to feel a lot more for her than Benton probably wanted.",1
"The actors's chemistry is just perfect. Yet, it has fine humor as well. There is nothing wrong with the film. A timeless classic.",1
"I think not! I tried but I couldn't. Thank god I was alone! Wow, that's all I can say. This is probably the purest film I have ever seen.",1
"Yes, it'dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. 5.",1
"It earns its right to elicit sobs. < br / > < br / > The film is tear - jerky at the finale, but not in a manipulative way.",1
I highly recommend it.,1
now these men are not evil or wrong for they have done a great deal of good for wine. in the world of wine there is a huge different between the big winery and the small one. what is means many times wine filtered of it's origin. mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. as we all know power corrupts.,1
"He's also funny at times. Kramer vs. Kramer "" is a great film from start to finish.",1
"Yours Sincerely, Ian PS. Hi!",1
But sadly I was a little disappointed. Really exciting stuff! But not enough fighting for top rating.,1
It's not really about wine. It's an open show that doesn't lead conclusion.,1
"< br / > < br / > At least we have this one. Then when he gets elected, he surprises them. Stewarts is more famous & has a stronger message.",1
The old telephones are enchanting.,1
They decide Lloyd just might be a better patsy than the guy who just died. As it turns out Lin Po turns out to be one wise dude. But no sooner does Lloyd arrive and pastor dies. Deeds and Mr. Smith.,1
"This movie caught me by surprise. Early on, he meets man who turns out to be a local party boss. The word "" Chink "" is used repeatedly. So, my advice is at the end, just suspend disbelief and enjoy. Well, the unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins!! ! < br / > < br / > An important note : This movie is definitely NOT politically correct.",1
"( But, this is just MY opinion ).",1
"He didn't have a bad voice ; its high pitch suited his "" glasses "" character. < br / > < br / > The first sound movies were often disasters. What is often neglected about Harold Lloyd is that he was an actor.",1
"Or is it? These three ( and possibly "" The Sin of Harold Diddlebock "" ) were his best sound ventures. Lloyd tried the route that Chaplin took, but with less success. When a movie is made dictates what it's politics are : "" The Cat's Paw "" is from 1934.",1
!,1
"This is in the book but not the movie. Liz has boyfriends and does coke. Finn however does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends. Still, these are minor shortcomings.",1
< br / > < br / > High recommended. Just saw this movie 2 days ago.,1
But as the story develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear.,1
High quality movie. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. I really enjoyed Fierce People.,1
"Early days I know, but Lane acts her socks off here.",1
I liked it. I guess it is a drama.,1
It defies categorization. And what a treasure it was. Poof. Vanished.,1
But the end of the film is great to watch but hogwash. What were they thinking?! There are no complaints about the action or acting.,1
Possibly it the very realistic depictions of martial arts. I always wondered why it's not more well known. How much of the film is true is questionable. In the middle of this is the legendary bullfight with a mad bull. Chiba seems so exhausted at one point that it hurts to watch.,1
"Oliver Stone is a minor master of the moody. For me, it was the passion that Eric Bogosian put into his performance. The corporate boys congratulated him on the performance. He preferred his own prison instead of the world on the outside. Bogosian probably nailed one of the toughest single - man performances in modern cinema. He speaks and it doesn't speak back.",1
< br / > < br / > A film not easily forgotten.,1
You have to see it to believe it.,1
< br / > < br / > Listen if you dare!,1
"But Nossiter managed to give his movie a consistency all along. I was expecting a lot from this movie, and I can say I haven't been disappointed. You may not like it, but I don't consider it as a defect.",1
"Rather, the shots of the buildings act as an anchor around which the study is observed.",1
Good performances by Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin also help. And things may be heating up more than anyone realizes.,1
This movie really draws you in.,1
).,1
"Bogosian's hawkish features burn into the frame, with his green eyes constantly darting around as if permanently seeking an answer to some riddle. The support cast are great, particularly Greene as the ex - wife and Baldwin as the boss. Is Barry a media messiah in search of truth, or a social misfit out to assault his audience?",1
"Alright, the first time I seen "" Talk Radio "" was in a video store for only $ 2. 00. I have never seen such a film like this. But still I think it fits okay.",1
"Stone has nothing to be ashamed of, most directors would kill to get a shot @ a film like this.",1
Profit vs. art.,1
"Though this is what has made him a popular radio show host, it has also earned him numerous enemies. Never having seen an Oliver Stone film before, nor any films starring Eric Bogosian, I didn't know what to expect from this film. < br / > < br / > The acting in this film was hugely impressive with not one dud actor in it.",1
"Look on his CV for proof! Now I might be reading too much into it, but I don't believe that.",1
"Talk Radio is an unsettling and amusing attack on what is now known as "" reality TV "". It remains even more poignant today than it was in the late'80s. The film asks the question of "" is our main protagonist just the same as the sad people who call up the show? """,1
"Stone and Bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity. Ellen Greene is fantastic as Barry's sweet ex - wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal vitriol. The Stewart Copeland score is brilliant, too. """,1
Just the story of Alan Green? I don't think so.,1
Barry get's his high rating by his razor sharp wit and abusive behavior when he's on the air. One of them decides to take matters into his on hand at Barry's expense.,1
Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of those pundits you hear on the radio stations many of us might turn off.,1
I sure was. Talk Radio usually doesn't.,1
! This high profile cannon fodder is something that Barry Champlain thrives on!!,1
We do indeed all need a little disorder - bravo Hubert!,1

"When it was shown in Cannes, it was close to three hours long. I love wine and I love hearing about the controversies raging in my business. There are many many more fascinating personalities in this documentary. Now, for me, that's fine.",1
"So, as a result of being silenced this way, Danton et al begin publicly criticizing the government. Danton was a hero and one of the founders of the French Revolution of 1789. However, I really wish the ending had been handled differently. This movie is set five years later and the revolution has morphed into something ugly. So much for "" liberty, equality and fraternity ""!",1
This was the first French language film made by Andrzej Wajda after he had arrived in France from Poland. Danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to curb the bloodletting.,1
Yep.,1

"Nevertheless, Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film - making.",1
I love this movie.,1
Emotional! I loved this movie.,1
Nan expects this too.,1
"But if you have heart, and you believe in love, you will cry at the end as much as I did!",1
That's where Nan will discover the power of socialism and learn how to get back to fame. The young girl soon joins the act as another male impersonator and they are a major hit. I loved the film and the novel.,1

The game itself is great.,1
Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well - aimed shot to the head.,1
"When it came out, it was the greatest game of all - time, and even today, it stays strong. How? I also disliked that this game didn't have Q or M or Moneypenny, or anyone from MI6. They just didn't use it. And while I do Even those little things can't really put this game down.",1

Kevin Kline offers a brilliant comic turn in the 1997 comedy IN & OUT. Now this floors Howard because he as no clue why thus guy would say this on international television.,1

This is truly a funny movie.,1
But this is a farce and not real life. Here the Hanks character is played by Matt Dillon.,1
Very good!,1
"Then, too, the script, the direction, and the production are very, very nice. You guessed it, its Howard! This is a wonderful, funny, and humane film about a gay man and his situation.",1
"He is a gifted physical performer, but the film gives him only few moments to shine. Howard is middle aged, deeply closeted or in self - denial, and evidently has never had a sex life.",1
Hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated gays as lepers.,1
I found the movie very funny and heart - warming.,1
"It would have been truer to the message. Rather than setting Howard free, it pigeon holes him. It almost becomes bland with the rest. Oh, he likes to dance to music, than he must be gay.",1
Won't dissapointed with this cops and robbers flick.,1

Joan Cusack really has a knack for screwball antics.,1

But this crackpot film is something else. < br / > < br / > Although a revisionist Western, the treatment of the Indian is problematic.",1
"One minute action, the next pure comedy. Which is hard to do with a vampire movie. I enjoyed this movie okay, it just could have been so much better.",1
I KNOW vampire movies. The SFX are great.,1
It is by far the most definitive film on the police force which I have seen. Definitely not to be missed.,1
To add the cherry on the cake twins are both quite lovely to watch too. The twins effect is a vampire martial arts movie available in Cantonese with English subtitles. < br / > < br / > The direction is crisp and the script is sharp.,1
"It's not even close. Charlene and Gillian are naturally cute, charismatic, and humorous. Even the abominably horrible Ekin Cheng was good in this one.",1
"How about you? PLEASE, please please? I liked Reeve a bit. It was worth it! What did you liked?",1
< br / > < br / > The story is pretty poor overall.,1
"It has to be said the slapstick is immense fun too. Despite this, it does have a few sticking points. < br / > < br / > For the non - purists and those with more forgiving tastes though, Twins Effect is a delightfully silly kung - fu comedy. If you go into the Twins Effect looking for a pure Hong Kong movie experience you will be disappointed. < br / > < br / > The action is a blend of two genres really. The sequence with the disco - dancing vampires is a total classic.",1

The depths of emotion that Cassavetes is able to draw out of the smallest gestures and interactions is incredible.,1

"Overall, I suppose it's really about stasis vs. change in human life. At first I didn't like Lelia, but as the film progressed you see more and more she's one of those actors who gets better as the tension and drama builds - not necessarily best with small talk. I suspect that Cassavetes had the plot organized enough, and it was just the dialogue that was improvised. What's amazing is the extent of the amateur actors'embodiment of their characters.",1
It's adjusted to the pictures.,1
"In certain ways, though, they couldn't be farther apart. < br / > < br / > It doesn't reach it, mainly because naturalism is a myth, particularly in cinema. 1959 was a landmark in the world of film. Godard was still a believer in the director as arbiter of style.",1

It's easy to see why many people consider In the Mood for Love to be Wong Kar - Wai's best film.,1

It is fantastic! A sick and twisted tale of coincidence and deceit.,1
( US Studios take notice : you may spare dollar or two by hiding competent Portuguese directors! ) This time he's really doomed Or is he?,1
"Oh, yes!",1
This is probably one of the best Portuguese movies I ever saw...,1
"Despite its ultra low budget, "" Sorte Nula "" is the most successful Portuguese film of 2004. I feel one of the film's major attributes would have to be the environment that it establishes. It's creepy but hilarious at the same time. And I must say, a well deserved success.",1
The portrayal of the Marines in this film is spot on. Millius is a genius.,1
My wife laughed at this. Let this one out.,1
"Not a nice cartoon, but sometimes life isn't nice.",1
"! < br / > < br / > A Wonderful Movie! """,1
His portrayal is sensitive and touching.,1
Why water down such a great storyline? The screenplay was average.,1
late.,1
I can hear the cynics groaning. Of * course * that would never really happen. This is a truly great and beautiful movie.,1
"I liked it, and my vote is seven.",1
"Okay, not that surprised, as American awards tend to go to women in'serious'roles, filled with angs And very cleverly too! I loved this film! < br / > < br / > Graham's performance as Joline is brilliant.",1
"The film played for a week or two in major urban centers and vanished. I get the feeling that Lisa Krueger is easy to overlook. Sociologically, she's a complete deviant. Or perhaps even a misreading.",1
"Give it a try - despite the trite looking DVD cover. Truly, it is ourselves. Joline is like a wake - up call.",1
"It's quirky script and offbeat style is downright infectious. but Jo discourages his attraction to her. This is a very imaginative, quite humorous look at the marriage vow.",1
9 / 10 All actresses and actors give wonderful performances and the musical score is immaculate.,1
"Her name is Joline, and this is her story. Who knows?",1
The action scenes are very realistic. My vote is eight.,1
Enjoy. I highly recommend this movie.,1
This movie I've seen many times.,1
"Why? It is a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its emptiness, rage and solitude.",1
< br / > < br / > I recommend this movie to all movie connoisseurs.,1
It is the best film i have seen in the last 5 years. There are no bad and good boys in the film. And the final scene! They say genius things! Why ask him what have he done?,1
It'really thought provoking and made me ponder a lot.,1
Poor Helene is best known for appearing in this pretty dreary film that bought a revolution to Hollywood! ! They soon do realise it and regret the day they left their small town. The only thing keeping them going is the loan that Eddie's mother gave them and that they desperately want to pay back.,1
And there are singing and dancing numbers! That was good money back in 1928. Lights of New York was the first all - talking feature film. < br / > < br / > The plot is quite simple.,1
No one expected this little film to gross an amazing $ 1. 3 million.,1
3 million. Title cards are intercut which redundantly announce characters and locales.,1
He'wonderful!,1
Well worth experimenting with. Rental stores'staff! Wrong too.,1
( I gave it 7. ),1
I loved it.,1
I will watch again. This is one of those movies Cameron did for the sake of acting and not for star billing.,1
The strong survive.,1
"However, those were my only "" complaints. "" It seemed like I never even blinked. Phoebe learns more and more about this as the movie progresses. I found the character of Wolf not totally convincing. < br / > < br / Their mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents. The story was quite unique and at times had a surreal quality.",1
"Don't mess with the Corps, Abdul. Noblesse oblige, by way of Von Clausewitz? It is visually eloquent, highly evocative.",1
Faith has killed herself. When we This story was familiar ground for me. It is 1969. Phoebe can't let it go. Cameron Diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly.,1
Great movie. The ending is truly moving.,1
The plot of this film is not complicated. 9 out of 10.,1
Why did she < br / > < br / > commit suicide?,1
Their acting superb by far. It really struck a chord with me. Well done by all.,1
< br / > < br / > Phoebe can't forget Faith.,1
"Gee, thanks a lot Wolf! He is reluctant but decides to travel with her.",1
solid 8 / 10.,1
"But the harsh truth is clear as day : nobody has stepped up to claim his mantle. His star will continue to shine long after so many lesser lights have blew out. It's everything that Bill Hicks spoke against. Bill Hicks was honest, beyond that he was the funniest of them all.",1
< br / > < br / > I rated it a ten.,1
"Let's make sure nothing is too provocative, nothing will be too interesting And the result? The numbers don't lie, 109 people have voted for this film. And then the second film is a complete performance.",1
So I decided to watch it one more time. I think that it means that the movie's real time is not specified. But they had clothes and cars with a design typical for the 1950's. Crazy six is pendling between red and the blue color. When I first watched this movie I thought it was a very strange movie.,1
Oh my GOD!,1
But everyone did fine job. That is really my favorite kind of filmmaking. I thought the cult stuff was great. This is a very Freudian psycho - thriller. Carax has a minimalist style.,1
Seriously.,1
"So Leos Carax has to changed, and he did.",1
Pola X is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience. I was wrong.,1
?,1
"You will, I hope, be rewarded in the same way that I was. It's best I've seen all year. Pola X is a beautiful adaption of Herman Melville's'Pierre ; or, the Ambiguities '.",1
"If these sorts of things don't impress you, skip it. Consequently, if you are not into tragedies, this is not your movie. Overall I give this movie a 7.",1
So many people hated this film!,1
I've just seen it... and liked it. < br / > < br / > And no.,1
"As he searches for happiness, he becomes more and more miserable. I hope more people discover this tantalizing film. Newspapers even published headlines like : "" Melville Insane! "" The alternate title : "" The ambiguities "" is quite appropriate. which, of course, he wasn't.",1
"The musical score is also remarkable an fits accordingly. Give it chance, you won't regret it.",1
< br / > < br / > If you can find this uncut... it's worth a look. It's a nice little film.,1
"Too bad he is virtually forgotten today. The film is fast paced, funny and worth seeing.",1
The writing was also very strong.,1
Furball was the silent Sylvester and Sweety was the pink Tweetie bird.,1
"Please release those! OK, the show was a little uneven, but I still loved it.",1
"It's not really an "" epic "" film in the strictest sense, but it's one of the best pure action movies ever made. 1904.",1
It's now 2005 and 15 + years since this cartoon first aired. The comedy was surreal and wacky.,1
It's breathtaking. < br / > < br / > This movie is MUST.,1
"This is an actor. I thought "" he's got it! He didn't. ).",1
I have wrestled with death.,1
"That the child wants to die. "" Once again Almenábar has provided us with a top quality film.",1
"Since many other users have already explained and commented the storyline, I won't do it. ) Most obvious of those are the family.",1
'The Sea Within'deserves all the awards.,1
I would think not. It is he who wants to die.,1
"Instead, the Rasuadli stated that the Europeans had guns on wheels that make the ground shake. The German Mauser was one of the world's finest rifles.",1
"< br / > < br / > Even if you do have a strong policy, either pro or anti - euthanasia, you may find yourself hoping Ramón gets what he wants at the end of it all anyway. But the film isn't a political statement and perhaps thankfully it shies away from too many scenes of debate although it does include one for the sake of argument anyway.",1
Now I'm not here to say anything about the right for or against euthanasia. The problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it. Certainly Javier Bardem is an actor that brings something extra to each film he makes. Bardem just does what he does well... and that's it.,1
"You're supposed to be rating the film, as a film. He does not focus on societal debates.",1
"A star is born. Judges had denied several times his petitions of active euthanasia. This is ( the actors selection ) the strong point in Amenábar's movie. < br / > < br / > - Facts ( II ) : "" Mar adentro "" becomes THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR in Spain.",1
"I give it a 9 / 10, and in my opinion it is by far the Best Film of year so far. The supporting cast was terrific! Consider this : he has to carry this movie with only his face!",1
"The film does give time to many different sides of the argument. The nominations also came during the entire Terry Schiavo debacle, just to put it all in some historical perspective. It is guilty of a couple of crimes, though, and I'd still understand why disability groups could have a problem with it. I don't look kindly on the way he's depicted. The film is, honestly, pretty dumb and uncomplex.",1
THE SEA INSIDE a film by Alejandro Amenabar.,1
"The dialogs lines are very solid and intelligent. Unfortunately, neither the movie nor the DVD gives this important information. Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain in the present days.",1
Especially large scale end battle does not disappoint. Seem that John Milius is just a big admirer of him. < br / > < br / > It isn't until halve way through that the movie fully gets on steam. I wish the entire movie was like this.,1
< br / > < br / > Ramon's family is shattered by the experience. < br / > < br / > Ramon Sampedro is a man confined to bed. There is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part.,1
And this is what the movie is about : love. Then I watched the movie. Oh my friends.,1
Six stars out of five.,1
"Death with Dignity "" is their watchword.",1
Greetings again from the darkness.,1
We are constantly encouraged to see the hope and the beauty of life lived with love. < br / > < br / > I don't remember a film which moved me and provoked me as much as this.,1
'Condenado a vivir'( 2001 ) ( TV ) was the first version of this man's life on which I have already commented.,1
b has said.,1
And nearly no dancing at all.,1
The mother in her still couldn't find the strength to destroy his myth. Both the wives find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband. What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms?,1
No.,1
I concur with what mallicka. b has said.,1
I cannot say that is long. The script also supports the story very well. Aishwarya's acting : par excellence.,1
"Soon, her friendship with Ashalata flourishes. Chokher Bali A passion play. But, soon, she unmasks her real face.",1
"< br / > < br / > As always, I think Aishwarya did a fantastic job. First, the original Bengali version was 20 + minutes longer. The director, Rituparno Ghosh, was there to give a short introduction and answer questions afterwards. I think her interpretation was valid, although there could certainly be other ways to do it. Next, there was a segment where Binodini was writing a poem - - a sign of her independence, etc. Possible, maybe ; realistic, I'm not so sure. So what was left out?",1
! It´s a movie that shows everything and more!,1
"You know Hollywood. The score is as sweeping and exotic as the images. What do you think HE thinks? This is one great, sweeping, movie you will remember for a long time. So much for that.",1
!,1
"The dreams of Karim Hussain are to be feared. The film's opening meditation on madness is both well written and profound. Religion won't save you, nor will mother nature or your own family.",1
f * * k yeah!,1
But that is just my opinion. They are a great inspiration as I soon embark on my own short film production.,1
"Very short but this one kind of blows the film's momentum. ). cking bloody holes in a field and whatnot. Some will call it trash, some will call it brilliant.",1
"give it a try. The brother is crazy and the sister is somewhat of a whore. Visually I haven't seen anything like it. wrong. The second segment is my favorite. The gore effects in this one were great. Like I said above, it is an artsy film.",1
"Well, it's safe to say that Subconscious Cruelty is one weird film!",1
"Yuck and Ouch! Subconscious Cruelty "" has to be one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. "" The third part is my absolute favorite. I've never been more disturbed in my life by what I witnessed. The branches bleed when broken. It deals with a man'sexual obsession with his pregnant sister. In this segment people have sex with the earth.",1
"Watching "" Subconscious Cruelty "" is a real event, and not something the viewer will easily forget. And that music still amazes me, I have to try and find the soundtrack if is available. And a note to gorehounds, this is must - have.",1
I'm among the ones who liked it very much for several different reasons.,1
It was a good movie.,1
"Check it out. There is also a Jesus statue with a projection of awastika on it. "" The birthing scene is particularly nasty and not easily forgotten.",1
"Simply viewing the film makes manifest this film's ( or DVD ) artistic value. This cinematic version also strikes an exceptionally deep - rooted nerve that is, I maintain, both specifically ethnic, yet also generally universal. < br / > < br / > Briefly,. < br / > < br / > Perez'film, originally made as a highly - rated American Playhouse PBS production has taken some time to be released in DVD.",1
"I guess there must be reasons. That, at least, he can be a little happy with his own dreams. What do you want for them? Did you see the news?",1
B. J. is pretty funny. The kids are very cool too.,1
"In short, Barney may be annoying to some people and I completely understand why, but cut him some slack. I personally find this show to be very underrated period. I can understand how Barney can be annoying to some, but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous.",1
Of course not.,1
Kids? He entertains. I know what keeps Barney on the air. I know I did. They LOVE this show.,1
This show is great. Barney does this to us. So stop hating. And Barney helps that. Keep it to yourself. Where imagination lives on.,1
< br / > < br / > i haven't gotten any smarter but i enjoyed it.,1
* * * of 4 stars. What a dandy it is!,1
"You really have to see it to believe it. In the end, they both feel pretty foolish! Okay. But what about the poor spouses supposedly at home?",1
"A number of hilarious misunderstandings begin, with many clever gags all the way through. Both of them takes plastic surgery without the other's knowledge, and when they meet by accident just a little later, he doesn't recognize his wife and she doesn't recognize her husband. I don't think I'll reveal anything further, to make the viewing more enjoyable for you. Oh well, maybe it isn't that strange, really, inasmuch as he never starred in any full - length features.",1
Check out this little gem of a film.,1
"Multiple stretches is more like it. They each rush home excitedly, enter separately and are at first unaware of each other's presence.",1
I have just seen this broadcast on Channel 4. If you don't take religion seriously then you probably won't see much in this film. In fact it's hard to fault it artistically.,1
< br / > < br / > The supporting cast was also top - notch.,1
This one is about the murderer.,1
"If they didn't feel some kind of remorse, they wouldn't be asking for spiritual guidance. < br / > < br / > I read the User Comments and they react as if Matthew was real.",1
"< br / > < br / > And I think that is completely right. But I have even seen opponents turn into supporters. There is no lesson here you need to find one yourself. And this is a very rare thing in American films. < br / > < br / > Everyone praises the acting, directing and the music but since this has been said so many times the I will not repeat it all again.",1
You bet. Fun to watch?,1
"10 / 10. You get drawn into this film and become a participant, and there's character for just about everyone to identify with. It tells the story with little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity.",1
"One word for Tim - BRAVO. Susan Sarandon is, for lack of a better word, incredible.",1
It is must see.,1
"< br / > < br / > The Wind and Lion is hardly history. The intrigues get far beyond one brigand's demand for ransom. Never mind that though, his predicament was serviceable enough at the time.",1
"And I think I've seen a lot. For example, take the IMDb Top 250. Suffice it to say : This is the best film I've ever seen. < br / > < br / > Mr. Robbins, your movie's issue split people's opinions. So now I get it : It's all political.",1
I watched it twice. It describes reality.,1
"I can't recommend this film enough, 9 / 10.",1
Honor.,1
"Overall, a good movie that I'm glad I saw. I'll check out the follow - ups if I ever get a chance. Really, I was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture. I don't know why all the lyrics were not printed.",1
Great film! Unmatched. Where is that today?,1
I own both of these on VHS. It was worth the wait. I laughed when I saw this. And of coarse a great movie.,1
I LOVE this film.,1
"There is also a lot of humor in the interplay among the main and supporting characters. Brian Keith ( very good as TR ) says, "" Pedecaris alive or the Raisuli dead! """,1
"The film starts out with a blistering collection of clips played over music from the band X. How about Black Flag renting their apartment / rehearsal space for 16 dollars a month! No internet, crappy jobs, and all out hostility collide in this genre. The decline series is amazing and director PS can't get enough credit for making these movies. All the band performances ( and there are many ) are awesome, especially FEAR who never cease to amaze me.",1
After I saw this movie that completely changed. Highly recommended.,1
"Don't blame the messenger. If all this rings true - read on - you are likely to find some consonance with at least part of this review. < br / > < br / > Although I didn't grow up in California, the American punk scene was the first music scene I ever truly lived in.",1
Great film! Unmatched. Where is that today?,1
It really is a great illumination of the burgeoning punk scene in LA in 1980. These guys just didn't care. Whew!,1
A performer like that would probably scare Steve Miller and Jackson Browne out of their skins.,1
Wow. What a day!,1
This is high adventure at its best.,1
"Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. Benes is a super - nice guy, but no fool. The poem is much in evidence, but the theme - - it gets a little lost.",1
( no spoiler! ) A poor girl is wooed by a prince. She deserves more. He's real low class socially handicapped wretch. He is a real horror show.,1
!,1
0 out of 10 and recommend it.,1
Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy co - star. With many up and coming and aging Australian actors Crackerjack is a hidden gem.,1
"Crackerjack is a funny movie, everyone at the bowlo has seen it and all say the same. Jack buying all the raffle tickets to win the meat tray.",1
Even the promotional posters for the movie had me nervous. 7.,1
And secondly because good Aussie comedy films are sadly as rare as the Tassie Tiger. Bowls reporter on a local rag. If you're wondering which Aussie Rules team Mick supports check out the flag on his workstation. Interesting character though. I was reticent to see this flick before reading the external reviews and user comments posted here. Why?,1
There is low level coarse language. This is quite a clever little movie. It is well above Mick Molloys usual gutter humor.,1
< br / > < br / > I'm sure that those who enjoyed The Castle and The Dish would also enjoy this movie. < br / > < br / > John Clarke's dour role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest but he gives solid performance.,1
I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed. It's just good laughs at genuine 1972 prices. Go see it and learn the joys of Lawn Bowls! This is the best Australian comedy I've seen in a long time.,1
"All in all, a witty, feel - good movie. 7 / 10. As a fan of his, I was used to a different kind of humour than displayed here. It is, at times, inconsistent and un - even, but a decent script works past that, and makes for some entertaining viewing. I was very impressed with the latest production from Mick Molloy. A familiar, and successful formula, that is handled well.",1
"Trust me, Atlanta has not changed. It also stands as one of the best contemporary crime dramas. Kick back, each your popcorn, and watchterling silver cinema action. It's just too bad that Hollywood does not make enough films like this one. Sharky's Machine is easily one of Burt Reynolds best efforts.",1
"Isn't there a SWAT team? Sure it makes the guy sweat, but it causes many more cops to be killed. It is a shame that the climax is a typical shoot - em - up. he is actually a pretty good director. Burt Reynolds directed this action movie and ( surprise! )",1
His new digs offers him the chance to meet many equally upstanding officers who are doing the dirty jobs no one else wants. < br / > < br / > The story is pure Detective procedure / actioner.,1
Zey are all mine. You can't have! I watered her so very often. You like?,1
PLEASE remake this classic film! Very cool stuff. 44 magnum on his way down.,1
The film also a great soundtrack too.,1
A nice little gem of a comedy. And they meet others as well.,1
"Rating 4 out of stars. Great just great! It was his GROUP of fellow cops. Well I knew who played Sharky, I wonder what his machine was. That was the BOMB!",1
"This is Burt Reynolds'"" Citizen Kane "". It seemed to me that he put everything he had into it.",1
The result is a great film noir.,1
"Billy blasts a hole the size of a twelve inch pizza in door of Dominoe's apartment and kills her. Sharky winds up in a real cesspool of crime. Henry Silva is truly icy as a hit - man. During the melee, an innocent bystander dies. ) in the basement. John Woo's "" The Killer "" replicates this scene.",1
< br / > < br / > Sgt. It was on one night and I thought oh well why not.,1
Busting hookers johns and perverts Sgt.,1
Check it out. This movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever. Reynolds doesn't do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films.,1
Why Laura? It was reported in fact that Clint Eastwood was offered this film.,1
( Where'd she go? ) WOW!,1
See this just to watch Andy. They don't have the word lie in their vabularies.,1
"6 rating here on IMDb, and dismissed by many critics as "" gooey slush "" ). Yet it seems to have fallen out of favour slightly ( Only a 6.",1

I think the heroine overshadowed hero.,1
< br / > < br / > Love is a many splendored thing.,1
A warmly felt experience! This film works for me.,1
"Still, I enjoyed it.",1
The ending is a real tear - jerker. William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world.,1
"Age cannot tarnish the beauty of this East - west love story for me. The film is unarguably physically busy, interesting and often beautiful also.",1
The genre often provided roles for actresses older than the heroines of standard romances.,1
He nails the type perfectly. In this film even second tier actors shine.,1
Don't miss that many splendored film.,1
I just left the room to be on my own.,1
She's desiring AND desirable.,1
'nuff said. Now go watch!,1

He was an enormous talent.,1

7 / 10 stars.,1
The effects are a hoot. The writing is hilarious.,1
"Well, maybe 15 for DVD, but you'll be real happy you did. Talk about your classics!",1
I hate to describe it too much - it's so short that the premise is just about the whole thing. < br / > < br / > Fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid.,1
"Anyway, this is great. You get the point, I'm sure.",1
That made it even funnier! A definite 10! This REALLY works with an audience!,1
"This film is just another example of this. Unknown to them, Matthau has no money either. Matthau falls for Dyan Cannon, on board with her fellow gold - digging mother, the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch. The widower Lemmon falls for Gloria De Haven, looking lovelier than ever.",1

That's what makes it so great! Buy it. It was shot to look cheap ( or was it just cheap? ),1
It's stupid but it's fun. < br / > < br / > 10 out of 10.,1
I remember many of the moves but not nearly all of it. Thanks for making my day! I LOVED the show.,1

< br / > < br / > 9 / 10.,1
They will be sadly missed. God bless you both.,1
It was a shame that it wasn't released at cinemas for a wider audience.,1
So anyway I liked it.,1
I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland. And it does.,1
"Excellent acting, very believable. !",1
< br / > < br / > John Hatter ( Mickey's boss ) - Is he really'mad '? Below is a list of the ones I uncovered.,1
"I really would like to see it released on DVD. It is not the quantity, but the quality that counts. We are all going to die one day sooner or later.",1
"It didn't take long to realize that this was a gem. It's dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also humorous. I checked it out on IMDb and got curious. I can't think of a single thing that bothers me about it.",1
"Let me start out with saying I was VERY surprised with the production value of this movie. < br / > < br / > And I am a 25 year old male that just wanted to see a free movie. Humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this film... not by a long shot.",1
"The Cure is one of the few movies I rated 10 out of 10. < br / > < br / > 10 / 10, nicely done!",1
Keep the kleenex nearby.,1
"Which kinda pulled me two ways. For that fact alone, it's a recommended view.",1
But remember to have the Kleenex ready!,1
Brad Renfro does very well in this movie as well.,1
< br / > < br / > 7 / 10 I'd recommend this movie for nice laugh if you want one.,1
There were other great scenes throughout the movie. You just have to. At that part i lost it.,1
A must see!! Extreme heartwarming.,1
Thanks.,1
The Cure is a fantastic film about a boy with AIDS.,1
And the tragic finale with Dexter's contraction of AIDS is enough to make me shed tear. Very well done.,1
He did an incredible job. The acting also rates up there.,1
"< br / > < br / > Definitely check this one out, but prepared with your Kleenex - - you'll need!",1
It is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood.,1
"I cried a bucket! Honestly, just thinking about it makes my eyes teary.",1
It's something worth watching.,1
Only this one isn't. A bucket movie. I had seen The Cure when I was a kid and I loved it then. A tear jerker.,1
I was in tears at the end.,1
So all that I can say about The Cure is one simple word great. Annabelle Sciorra also give a terrific performance as Dexter's mother. So it's easy to understand that I've met lots of troubles trying to find this movie.,1
The latter has acquired AIDS from a blood transfusion.,1
"All characters are brilliant. There are only 2 series! < br / > < br / > So please, release it, let it go! ).",1
"Of course, I was only five at the time it came out. Gee, I wonder why?",1
What a stunner whoever she was! And that makes all the difference in this film. Also note gorgeous blonde to the right of Barthelmess at the roulette table.,1
< br / > < br / > Multi - talented Frank Albertson has a small role as Barthelmess'improvident buddy. Beautiful Constance Bennett is the millionaire's daughter who makes Barthelmess miserable.,1
Sam has yet to learn this lesson. It seems that Allana and her wealthy father are vacationing in the same motel. Everybody at the motel knows about Sam being a Chinaman with the exception of Allana. They fall madly in love together.,1
I think he'right!,1
"Only Newby, injured, remains at large. Half comedy, half romance, the story is simple and unambiguous.",1
"However, it's charming pleasure from first scene to the last.",1
Worth a look. The problem here is the script.,1
"Hmmmm, sounds familiar.",1
Halliwell Hobbes & Doris Lloyd also appear to advantage.,1
This is certainly a well done tour de force. It's a time that people won't soon forget. ).,1
!,1
"They are thoughtful, scenic and have great plots. I have seen all of the Redford / Hillerman series. It's great.",1
I laughed so hard that it hurt. I love this type of comedy. I was Rollin.,1
< br / > < br / > Check it out if you get chance. They live together but are both having doubts about their relationship.,1
I loved this movie.,1
I've always liked him. < br / > < br / > The acting is great from everyone.,1
All the actors and actresses played well. It raises again and again in my thoughts.,1
"Thanks! An unexpected, very enjoyable surprise. I am in my late 40's and she in her early 50's.",1
Then. Racism. Something with dance. It struck home. How could we?,1
< br / > < br / > Good movie.,1
"It's really not a silly romantic comedy. Well, the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected. It's worth a watch.",1
"Too bad she doesn't get the recognition she deserves. < br / > < br / > Good supporting performances help immensely, too. There are some genuine laughs here. We see how couple works through this strange situation.",1
"His Ed is perfectly credible. Her Alice is a study in contrasts. Both do wonders together. Basically, she carries movie.",1
"They have amicable traits though, even though they are covered by the image of sex driven kittens. < br / > < br / > On another level, the film follows some of it'ensemble into different relationship work. < br / > < br / > By the end of the film, Mohr and Very funny stuff.",1
"As the frame freezes, we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. Sophisticated sex comedies are always difficult to pull off.",1
"Any Richter takes home award for most moralistic character. Romantic and funny, or just plain fun. I thought this film was a divine story. ).",1
What a shame! It was refreshing to watch.,1
The sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent.,1
"Okay, maybe this movie not a revolution. Many crimes. If you like this kind of movies, try this one!",1
! 7 out of 10 ( just ).,1
"Okay. Whiffs of Tarantino, etc. Paul Reiser is very good - - - definitely better than he was on TV. Not brilliant, not trash.",1
"2. He was terrific, as were all the performers.",1
"He takes Jewel to his home. And, of course, Michael Douglas. How could I forget him? Suddenly a shot - Utah´s dead.",1
Seriously.,1
Liv Tyler.,1
"It doesn't have any sympathy for any of the men, really. Dillon was never that innocent, etc. Think Nurse Betty, or Jawbreaker. No.",1
"I always get nervous when a director of commercials and music videos turns to filmmaking. Zwart resists that tendency. Randy is the first to see her, as an individual treats her unkindly.",1
Most enjoyable.,1
And a beautifully nuanced performance by Eileen Atkins as his mum is an added bonus. What's there not to like?,1
I don't see what everyone hates this movie. I loved this movie!,1
"However, I did like this movie, I compare it mostly with the third movie ( which were bad ). Lastly I liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series, so at least we won't see a Critters 5 anymore. Ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise.",1
9. Third this movie is off the chain.,1
"If you're looking for a kung - fu action movie, look elsewhere.",1
Complete with episodes of singing and dancing! So the film has considerable historical import as well.,1
!,1
"I first saw this movie in the theater. I was 10. The music, the dancing, the acting. ; ).",1
!,1
A great film.,1
We just finished screening El Padrino in Australia. A phenomenal piece of film work.,1
This movie makes your heart race. !,1
If you have the chance view the film and enjoy it.,1
The story was made for these actors. ! Watch this film!!!!,1
This movie has a cutting edge to it.,1
It had me on my toes. Definite a must see.,1
! Rent it!,1
"They're not drawn as caricatures, but as realistic and very human people. Thank god for this movie. < br / > < br / > I love the fashion in this movie.",1
This film will leave you riveted. !,1
This movie was simply amazing.,1
I was blown away. And Tilly is HOT.,1
this movie.,1
! The directing was also magnificent.,1
Damien Congratulatoins on this film. The casting was picked real well.,1
Here only a 260. This film is just really Great. Buy this movie! Great Great Great. I don't know why.,1
It's really a shame.,1
"I admit, some of the content is a little corny and ripped off, but so what, every movie rips off another to some extent. Think of Resovoir Dogs. Who needs special effects? Well some movies don't need ny of that junk. Think about it : Star Wars, E. T., Ghostbusters, etc. I think not.",1
I just wonder what he's doing now.,1
Astin and Gosset Jr. give good performances.,1
1 in IMDb list?? ?,1
< br / > < br / > The film.,1
"He hated his father, and everything he stood for. Sean Astin is excellent. This movie was believable.",1
"This is one of the most entertaining "" bad "" movies in my pantheon. Ooh - rah, General Kramer! And the heroic Robert Folk score is the cherry on top.",1
I give it a solid rating 8 / 10.,1
this film has always been stuck in my mind. just a great film.,1
"The script, the acting, the screenplay. ! Everything in the movie is very exceptional.",1
"! The film is dark, with dark overtones. Why does it sound like the Goonies?",1
< br / > < br / > So how's the action?,1
"Still, I enjoyed it lot. Will they be able to do it?",1
"In my opinion, the plot is captivating.",1
He has done well since the goonies.,1
"Come Back Shane! "" Actually like me at the moment! ). where? But I just couldn't recognize her with her clothes on!",1
This is a cult film for many reasons.,1
""".",1
I did and it helped me. ( Was it Knot Landing? ) It's better than a lot of this genre.,1
I gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10.,1
< br / > < br / > Enjoy! It'actually pretty well.,1
For a LifeTime Movie it was better than most.,1
This one though isn't quite as good. Was there some weird fascination with them? Though what is the deal with boat races at this time?,1
YES! THIS IS the teen comedy... this film is forever lodged in my brain.,1
Little that is dirty in it. It never lets you rest.,1
! Who couldn't love this crazy movie? They were great.,1
This is classic 80's humor.,1
"Wow. < br / > < br / > Also, the music is really cool. 10 / 10 stars!",1
Plot was good.,1
10 / 10 They were both excellent movies!,1
Enjoy!,1
Annie Golden's role was minor but she acted very well.,1
"< br / > < br / > Memorable scenes include Bobcat getting stuck in a Godzilla suit (! ) One of the homes, needing it's mortgage repaid belongs to Demi Moore ( Cassandra ).",1
An absolute hoot.,1
We could use more movies from the likes of him.,1
"They certainly don't resemble the musicals made in the West. < br / > < br / > As for the film clips themselves, they're very entertaining. Plus, they are all extremely campy because of how alien they are to my western eyes.",1
This one succeeds at both.,1
"But as this film shows, if you were a filmmaker looking to entertain, it better be with a'message '. < br / > < br / > In short, some good stuff... but only if interested, really. I was shown the film in a class on documentary films, and half the class fell asleep.",1
Although some of the Stalinist films look laughingly bad ( The Bright Road (? ),1
"Some scenes did deliver, including a rousing clip from a Soviet film called "" Tractor Drivers. "" ( Look for the closing dedication to the person who made it all possible. ) ) < br / > < br / > The documentary is marred by somewhat insipid narration but it's still a lot of fun to watch.",1
"! my friend and i loved the film. i really recommend it, it'great!",1
And yet I can't help liking it. comes in a close second. movie.,1
No surprises.,1
The dog Einstien was impressive since it was well trained.,1
"Michael Ironside also appears in the film and does well as the'bad cop'side of the Government agents. < br / > < br / > The script for this film was originally written by Paul Haggis, who later disowned it. The plot obviously takes some influence from Predator and begins with an explosion at a research lab. I don't know why the writing here is nowhere near as ridiculous as his 2004 hit Crash! A secret Government agency is soon on the case, as the murders continue.",1
This is true. So is director Jon Hess. It's based on the book.,1
You gotto watch to learn more. OK read on. Then throws grenades.,1
! You simply HAVE to watch this movie!,1
"And if you like it, here are some more recommendation from me. TODAY. This was flawless. And that is the segment of people this movie was aimed at. Because this movie can heal your faith. Just go and watch it. Back to the movie. Not you average movie - goers by any chance!. I don't think it'd even be going too far saying that this movie can cure cancer.",1
Don't blame them!,1
Don't let the rating of 5.,1
! The same thing happens to Albert De Santi.,1
The audience adored her. Louie has just gotten out of prison. Albert is played delightfully by Michael Imperioli. ). There are twists and turns that add depth to this film.,1
Must be some special ingredient that makes Martin & Lewis product stay fresher longer. To me this one at least rates eight out ten. In those days much of our full - length comedy fare hailed from Denmark ( Nils Poppe anyone? ),1
They both look great as young sailors. They are believable. The songs are not memorable. Good ending.,1
I liked this movie. < br / > < br / > I give it 8.,1
'< br / > < br / > Robert Stack - WE LOVE YOU!!! ! There is nothing alike and has a mood all its own.,1
rodney's a bigger name and more distinct. < br / > < br / > i really loved part 2 over the first. i did like the murray / chase one better. 80s script? yes.,1
"( We miss you, Ted! ) was good in the ` new'Ted Knight / Villian role. Danny Noonan should have been back. There's nothing wrong with that except this : The return of Chevy Chase as Ty Webb. Robert Stack ( Airplane! )",1
I think this is a great movie. A good end to series.,1
Are his lines as good? The first film is a cult classic ; what could possibly follow it up? But he is funny. No.,1
"For my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over - directed. Caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly - held classic. It comes across as far more self - conscious in its attempts to get a laugh.",1
They had a whole week?,1
"The antiwar musical "" Hair "" is my number one cult - movie.",1
"Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality. India is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change. However, this is not the real issue. I'll believe it when I see it.",1
"Yeah, we get it. I was totally ready to hate him. It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.",1
It just gives an episode a bit more drama and bite.,1
This is always an excellent theme. I believe this film came out in 1990 right after Menendez killings.,1
Forensic evidence is almost nonexistent.,1
And I do.,1
"God bless our country, USA! Plot is breathtaking.",1
Fun movie!,1
"Go See It! Even during the same events, they shift back and forth.",1
I would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape. It is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed.,1
"< br / > < br / > There are tense moments as they gather and jimmy - rig the necessary materials for the flight. < br / > < br / > Despite the extreme danger involved in escaping to the West, they feel the rewards far outweighed the risks. This movie accurately portrays the struggle life was for the typical East German.",1
A real surprise.,1
East Germany had changed little since 1967. Why?,1
"However, the mystery isn't very compelling in the end.",1
This movie is a coveted member of my movie library. I should've asked. Careful of what? < br / > < br / > There is an audience for this film if they're looking for more contemporary version of film noir.,1
It didn work.,1
I can't wait to someday see live!,1
"It is regrettable that it has not ever ( to my knowledge ) been released on video or DVD. The story follows the ( supposedly true ) exploits of hiway - man Jack Shepard in 1700's London. < br / > < br / > Overall, I really enjoyed this film.",1
"Please, if there is an upcoming release, let us all know. ?",1
"( I only bought it because it had some songs that weren't on the TV special. ) FAME! """,1
I can't forget his backup singers.,1
Great voice! Man I loved show!,1
"I think i were near 6 - 8 parts of the movie. """,1
"Treat Williams lights up screen as Berger, the unconventional and free - spirited hippie who does his best to get Claude to loosen up and is matched scene for scene by Savage as Claude, who brings a lovely sweetness to the role of Claude.",1
Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from.,1
"I was a schoolboy when I watched this film for the first time. < br / > < With their inventiveness, curiosity, humour, dreaminess. ).",1
"and the ending is weak and "" so what? "" Nevertheless it is a good taste borrower! With a little bit of luck I won't bother naming them. < br / > < br / > Gangsters don't make money they take money. One of smarter gangsters, although all things are relative. And why not? Usually by fear.",1
"You knew who was on whose side, etc.",1
! It's worth seeing despite not being especially believable.,1
It's an easy film to recommend. ).,1
Do not attempt to compare them. The acting and photography are excellent. And the ending that has been added is just amazing.,1
She is her usual self. Juhi Chawla is beautiful and bubbly.,1
Juhi Chawla is cute as ever in a fairly good performance. Some good songs including Tu mere samne being best.,1
Darr ( 1993 ) was an incredible movie.,1
You will feel sad and happy and relieved and afraid at the same time.,1
This was Yash Chopra'last masterpiece.,1
It is must see! Very clever.,1
He does a good job though. Tanvi Azmi supports well. And Veer - Zaara was magical. Dil To Pagal Hai was fresh and perfect to watch. Juhi Chawla is decent.,1
The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old. ).,1
He loves her deeply and even engaged to marry her.,1
The story is excellent. The movie belongs to Srk.,1
! PS any recommendations would be appreciated!,1
"But Juhi and Sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie. < br / > < br / > A must see for everyone! I also thought "" Tu Mere Samne "" was quite nice also. Never in my life will I forget the line, "" I love you K.. k.. k.. Kiran! "" Darr is a great movie!",1
"simply "" Darr "" is one of the best Indian films ever made. She fears one & fears for the other.",1
"He'done similar roles before, but he's good. Like I said, Juhi looks like a Goddess in this film. ).",1
Absolutely not.,1
MGM rocks for doing this on many of their DVD releases. I love the option of seeing in Widescreen. ! It never looked better!,1
"Steph "" cuts from school and gets caught by her father. You relate to a show like this when you are either. Where is the realism? Where is the comedy in such a situation?",1
"i really like this series. his rants break the program up, and allow a really good flow.",1
How bad was the show doing? Thank G * d for DVR's! PLEASE! Now we are stuck watching either crappy shows or DVD's.,1
!,1
It can be easily compared with married with.. children. Last episode opens many continuous and funny moments.,1
Michael Rapaport is a star.,1
This show is verging on brilliant. It isn't the world's most hilarious comedy. ( As is a classic example with Scru. ),1
"< br / > < br / > Its appeal, at least for me, lies in its real situations. Teenagers have sex.",1
This show is actually pretty good.,1
This isn't Happy Days or The Brady Bunch this is real life.,1
"Despite their best efforts to dissuade him, Claude does eventually report for basic training in the Army. !",1
!,1
"She is also dying. For the Sake of her 10 Children She Must Succeed! """,1
The role really deserved an Oscar.,1
"That and knowing Warren. It was pretty accurate. I met most of the "" children "" at Warren's wedding in 1989.",1
Thank you.,1
!,1
It is the story of a woman who'll die soon.,1
This has to be the ultimate chick flick ever.,1
Not to be missed.,1
It also does a unique justice to Central Park.,1
imdb.,1
Living here in the US I have yet to meet anyone who has seen this movie.,1
children. I cried non stop.,1
I usually find more to mock than to empathize with in the sentimental cinematic tripe foisted upon us these days. Among the special features one needs to include the Emmy Awards telecast the following year. And a well - written and well - acted story to boot. ). But this gem from the early 1980's still slays me.,1
Rushmore. That girl he beat was amazing.,1
< br / > < br / > Why don't you think about that?,1
"During that time I constantly lived in London. Singers, band members! It shows we've never been one.",1
< br / > < br / > Then there is the music. ',1
< br / > < br / > Impive!,1
It would certainly encourage me to visit Istanbul.,1
"Or not? Are your lips wet? I am listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed.",1
Enschuldigen Sie.,1
I liked the gag of Andre never tagging in. Or the fact that he did it pretty easily. Perfect. And the tag team matches are all very exciting.,1
There are questions that sometimes hover over us and have no answer.,1
Beware!,1
"Lots of social and political background. I could barely sit still in theatre. If this is your thing, you'll have a grand time. Pricey.",1
< br / > < br / > Faith Akin - this is a gem.,1
"You get everything from rap to the most traditional Turkish classical song, with rock, Kurdish music, and Turkish pop in between.",1
I highly recommend it to anyone.,1
"All of them share a passion for music and the belief in its power. But this movie does not only introduce you to the sound of Istanbul. Do not expect a compilation of Turkish folklore or anything like that. If you have never been in Istanbul, you will want to go there after having seen the film.",1
Well done Faith Akin.,1
"This is a movie about the music that is currently being played in Istanbul. For my perspective, the most interesting comments were from Orhan Gencebay. Other important topics are omitted such as Turkish jazz music, or music of the Armenians and Greeks. Today, it is a megalopolis of almost 10 million. The movie features different singers, instrumentalists and bands.",1
I had a place for both of them. Wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then.,1
Since most old movies are being - made nowadays.,1
Kudos are also in order for Stelvio Cipriani's moody and spirited score. Johnny and his gang become wanted fugitives after the plan goes disastrously awry. Well worth seeing for Kinski fans.,1
"Ultimately, "" The Beast "" amounts to a tragic character study brimming with irony. This low - budget oater has nothing appetizing about it. "" Never mind that Kinski is ideally suited to the role of'Crazy'Johnny.",1
< br / > < br / where all the movie actors eat between takes. Why is he utterly forgotten?,1
Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting. Or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off.,1
This was a great anime.,1
It is traditional without being unoriginal. This is an excellent anime movie.,1
I don't know of another film that deals with them. I enjoyed this for a couple of reasons.,1
"Sgt David Brent ( James Best ) is shot, the battle goes on, and then it transitions to him being treated for his wounds. Simple, direct language. Verboten, however, deals with the post - war experience, as we only get in the opening scenes the big boom of WAR - in bold for a point.",1
"< br / > < br / > Next match saw Earthquake defeat Hercules. Jim Duggan then beat Dino Bravo in a nothing match. Plenty of luck for Brutus Beefcake as he ended Mr Perfect's undefeated streak. New tag team champions crowned. It didn't work out. Not really a match, unfortunately.",1
"And the film ends too abruptly, and it lacks payoff. She has so few lines. The other main actors are good, as well. 9 / 10.",1
This kind of crud has to be stopped. I don't know if it's fair for me to review this. I'm not a fan of gratuitous violence.,1
"The acting from Pesci, Cortese and Vincent.",1
and authentic. with great Dialogue. it was well done. great.,1
Strong on characterization and visuals.,1
The crowd is 100 % pro Demolition in this match. The Hart Foundation gets an easy win. In the end Earthquake pins Hercules for the win. R. I. P. to both men in match. Perfect ). Big dominant heels were really a popular thing at the time.,1
Clever dialog.,1
"So ya think you've seen every Mafia movie ever made! This was probably his first shot, and it was a gem. Here's one that nobody every heard of. Pesci fans should run to the video store to check out this flick.",1
Too bad ; she did a good job! He only gets better with age.,1
Not a bad MOW. Daniel Magder was excellent.,1
"Pulling in 2. < br / > < br / > Laura Leighton plays the victim, and she does it well. Sadly I was mistaken.",1
Another gap. But the children are never shown to react one way or the other. < br / > < br / > Spoilers follow as to some specifics. He doesn't even comment or seem to notice.,1
"Martel wins, with the Boston Crab. HUGE Pop for Demolition. < br / > < br / > Matches.",1
"These 2 actors were among the best. There are quite a few deaths, some surprising. No car chases either. Production is first rate as well.",1
"He calls his friends in Paris to help him out. Now he's hiding out with his two kids. That's why it has style. For Davos'two best friends, time has passed and they've moved on. Obligation gives may to caution. That was several years ago.",1
"And, like these other films, he also has a very strong, though twisted, moral code. Both grew up in France and eventually had to flea due to their criminal activities. Much of the first third of the film concerns their covert return. < br / > < br / > Overall, this is a very good crime film - - sort of like French Film Noir.",1
"Rugged, craggy Lino Ventura captures the screen immediately as the criminal dad. They can tousle a kid's hair - and then shoot a threat in cold blood.",1
Sautet immediately agreed and the rest as they say is history.,1
"It never ends pretty for them, or their loved ones. < br / > < br / > Much like Melville's film, the seemingly simple story gets more subtlety complicated as it goes along. Classe Tous Risques is a definite keeper.",1
"; wonderful black and white cinematography by Ghislain Cloquet. What a year for him! """,1
"It was well worth the admission, as Classe tous risques is one of those kinds of French films that is just waiting to be re - discovered ( or discovered for the first time ). A couple of times the plot may seem to be leisurely, but it isn't.",1
It is almost film - noir meet neo - realism. Belmondo's restrained performance under Sautet's firm direction only shows what a wonderful actor he could - and should - have been.,1
YIKES!,1
The woman seduces a man into using it thus accelerating his doom. There is no place for any hope. and in my opinion still very watchable.,1
"It's fair to say, then, that critical reception is mixed. You may now be able to guess how this all ends.",1
"perfectly shot landscapes. She's wandering too, sort of, and is maybe too friendly with a big - time pusher named Wolf.",1
"Together they search for sun and exoticism. Actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Grünberg are very convincing. """,1
"It was an even bigger surprise to find that it is a pretty good movie. Why does Stefan take heroin? Maybe now I can appreciate it on the album, now that I have some visuals to accompany it in my mind.",1
Great sex scenes too. Pink Floyd score.,1
< br / > < br / > Rarely has something free been so worth invaluable. I chose Goodtimes DVD's four DVD collection of the series.,1
It's a target.,1
"In an ironic twist amid the devastation caused by German air attacks Beethoven's Seventh Symphony is employed to underscore the visual suffering. With an overwhelming edge in aircraft Goering's Luftwaffe looks unstoppable on paper. It is the 20th century version of the 300 Spartans. With all of mainland Europe under his control Hitler prepares for the last obstacle in his way before heading for North America, Great Britain.",1
"It was a turning point, forcing Hitler to rethink his strategy.",1
"< br / > < br / > Now then, dose the Mounties always get their man? The Frozen Limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as The Crazy Gang. 8 / 10 They were a group of British entertainers who formed in the early 1930s. I feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there's some very talented people at work here. Not all the comedy works, and in truth the "" big 6 "" are trumped big time by a film stealing Moore Marriott.",1
"I can see Stan Laurel making the same mistake. It will be worth it. Off they go to the Yukon and The Frozen Limits. < br / > < br / > By the way, it's case of misplaced Chamberlains.",1
"He outlived them all by years. Baddie Bill "" M "" McGrew wants it himself however.",1
A story about experience and vulnerability!,1
Tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. Tan as lead is nothing less than magnificent.,1
( God forbid! ),1
Great movie. Why?,1
"< br / > < br / > All in all, a remarkable vampire movie.",1
One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. Where are the yellow contacts? What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. The soundtrack is excellent.,1
why?,1
Hand of Death is not Jackie and Sammo's usual kung fu comedy.,1
"Akasha's head got knocked off in 1 sec and Lestat turned into the biggest punk in the world. REST IN PEACE AALIYAH now the movie did have faults, like the lack of explaining Akasha's past.",1
"Meanwhile Akasha has other plans. She goes to a vampire coven, a bar, and kills everyone in her path. I quite this Anne Rice book adaption. Jesse is given Lestats diary and reads of his first killing and an encounter with the Queen of the Damned - Akasha ( Aaliyah ). When he becomes a popular movie icon his fellow vampires, understadebly, go mad and plot his death. Join Her Or Die? When Lestat holds a concert in Death Valley he receives news that not only will angry vampires be there Akasha may come as well.",1
"Absolutely no loyalty to the books at all. Personally, I LOVED TRIS MOVIE! It's amazing!",1
My Rating is defiantly : 10 out of 10. !,1
Loved this story and film. Casting is wonderful.,1
It's not a children'movie. I've seen a lot too.,1
"But please don't compare it to the "" Interview "" movie. Actually it is a complement. But Akasha's death was very nice.",1
"Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie. Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main players ( and Jesse of the Talamasca ).",1
Take it as that. It's like a frickin'drug.,1
"The effects are dull and very disappointing. The scenes of sensuality were also atmospherically satisfying. < br / > < br / > This movie doesn't give all that it appears to be. < br / > < br / > The acting in QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was moderate, if disappointing.",1
"And they are not going for the music. If vampire tales are your cup of blood, then this Goth - fest based on the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience.",1
The acting is great and the storyline enthralling.,1
"The show holds the attention. And I think it is here. Alas, the series crashed after season one, so we never get a resolution.",1
True Love. I just saw it on DVD.,1
"And unfortunately, he could have cared less. In many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence. This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning Sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband.",1
Is this a new evolution coming about?,1
"He was a stroke of genius. < br / > < br / > A really great, class show.",1
I am sorry to see that SURFACE has not been picked up for the NBC 2006 - 2007 season. I for one would love to see where story goes after the tsunami that ended Episode 15.,1
"Plus, it felt like it was NBC's attempt at a "" Lost - killer "". That trait of the show, though shows how great it is. Yes.",1
Here'hoping Sci - Fi picks it up.,1
?,1
Did he have a grouth spert? I am a big fan of Surface.,1
Did the Olympics kill surface?,1
"My whole family loved to watch the show. I hope there's a lot of people out there that feel the same way. When i started watching "" Surface "" for the first time i was hooked.",1
And scifi.,1
"Such a shame. Just fantastic from start to finish, and as another reviewer commented, I LOVED how they ended every episode with a huge finish. I just wish the show's creators were given a fair chance.",1
"All things considered, a job very well done.",1
Wow!,1
"he was fine! Damn! Essence held it down for her girl, when she needed her.",1
They want excuses to not think. < br / > < br / > 95 % of the sheep watching TV don't want to rack their brains.,1
!,1
"A human element is introduced in the form of three American families, one on each coast and one on the Gulf of Mexico. And as long as things stay this vague there is a fair amount of tension and suspense. He takes one home where it hatches into an "" ET "" type dragon. I found the first 7 episodes ( Discs 1 and 2 ) extremely engaging and the remainder a disappointment. "" etc.",1
Quit dragging it on and on.,1
! It just doesn't make sense.,1
I love this show. I was under the impression it was going to have more seasons. I think they really dropped the ball on this one.,1
In the end the suits did it. This is one of the better sci - fi series. So they only did 15 episodes instead of the expected 22.,1
"So does "" Surface "" succeed? is what makes or breaks a show like this one. There is no denying it. Sci - fi on TV is difficult. The ending for me is not that appealing.",1
Nope! Not a Christmas movie. Did I write ten lines yet?,1
She must make a fortune. It's on Lifetime.,1
"He was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing. She performed well, but movie audiences didn't take to her. Now I like Victor Herbert. Sakall as Irish, HELLO.",1
There is an abundance of this.,1
"Call me old - fashioned but I liked it. etc., Faeries was a warm welcome at least by me.",1
The film does build in intensity towards a pretty good ending.,1
"But all they REALLY cared about was THE NEWS ITSELF. To do all that takes real talent, something Mr. J. Brooks has in abundance. All of which has nothing to do with why all three are actually IN those jobs. Or maybe not. The bottom line.",1
"This new ( news ingnorant ) guy coaching him? Altman knows all news stories, inside and out. Tom immediately charms people with humbleness. They don't listen to her.",1
"But of course, it's not that simplistic. A great, underrated movie.",1
I love this movie for many reasons.,1
"Typically, I'm a comedy guy. and rented it. Awesome! "" Well, maybe not that high, but it's only other romance I can think of that I like. Not everybody's life ends well, and it shows in Broadcast News. < br / > < br / > Boy, was I wrong.",1
Jane's and Aaron's trip to Central America. The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick.,1
This is a decent movie.,1
).,1
Her performance is perfect. The scales literally fall from her eyes. She is also hilariously neurotic. She was robbed! ). This is Hunter's film.,1
The rub comes when Tom reveals he is about to join her news bureau in Washington.,1
"Fortunately, they're few and far between. < br / > < br / > A legitimate classic.",1
I give this a 7 out of 10.,1
In my mind it succeeds on both levels on its own terms. Broadcast News { dir.,1
"Do we condemn game? Holly, having rejected both men, remains caught between them.",1
It cranks everything up and just goes. Worth a look.,1
"All in all, seven well deserved Oscar nominations. In this unpredictable comedy, there's no telling who Hunter ( neurotic heroine ) will end up with. He knows he's only capable of looking good, but is not a reporter.",1
"It was number 64 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!",1
Certainly not for everyone.,1
Holly Hunter is stunning. < br / > < br / > William Hurt has never been better.,1
"Great, great work. That's what I want.",1
"And make sure you don't sweat on camera. The course instructors impressed on us that TV news was a "" branch of show - biz "".",1
!,1
Holly Hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer.,1
This movie is about six men who are assigned to transport money from bank to businesses.,1
Now I understand why this movie was so good. This was a really nice surprise. This film made me realize he's a good actor. Because this film was very good.,1
It's a beautiful movie.,1
).,1
"It's not desert western, shot in the alps somewhere, and is lovely to look at. Sylvie Fennec is lovely as Sheba, who may be Hud's niece, or dead brother's girlfriend... that's never made clear.",1
"Yes, oddly. It's good.",1
Is she OK?,1
Which is exactly why I liked him. We would not be in them otherwise. He is a real character. What went wrong?,1
"His monologues are often overdrawn and pointless. And out of the order, meaning. The concept of this film is very original.",1
But everyone did fine job. That is really my favorite kind of filmmaking. I thought the cult stuff was great. This is a very Freudian psycho - thriller. Carax has a minimalist style.,1
"Guns, lots of guns. Nope. Get a dog. Bloody gunshot wounds?",1
Seriously.,1
"So Leos Carax has to changed, and he did.",1
Pola X is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience. I was wrong.,1
?,1
"You will, I hope, be rewarded in the same way that I was. It's best I've seen all year. Pola X is a beautiful adaption of Herman Melville's'Pierre ; or, the Ambiguities '.",1
"If these sorts of things don't impress you, skip it. Consequently, if you are not into tragedies, this is not your movie. Overall I give this movie a 7.",1
So many people hated this film!,1
I've just seen it... and liked it. < br / > < br / > And no.,1
"As he searches for happiness, he becomes more and more miserable. I hope more people discover this tantalizing film. Newspapers even published headlines like : "" Melville Insane! "" The alternate title : "" The ambiguities "" is quite appropriate. which, of course, he wasn't.",1
I only wish I could have seen more into Terri's life before film ended.,1
Or the French speaking in English. < br / > < br / > Why in English? The Ramayana is an epic. India is complicated. Especially today.,1
The film is a tribute to Huston'genius.,1
"< br / > < br / > But "" The Dead "" belies its title. John Huston made many remarkable and memorable films. It is not a dark story.",1
and I will be watching it again soon. In fact the rest of the film continued to give little away! < br / > < br / > 9 out of 10.,1
"Then some, believe that they hear it, but they don't.",1
"And with "" The Dead "" ( which was completed after Huston's death by his son, Tony Huston ) we get something nearly perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema. As with The Red Badge of Courage and The Man Who Would Be King, Huston revered the literary source but made the adaptation cinematic. It's fitting that John Huston, who held back in attempting to film this story, ended his career with it.",1
I am so glad I got to see it.,1
If anyone has insights to share on topic I'd be interested to hear more.,1
< br / > < br / > But then all the performances are extraordinary.,1
Huston just knew how to tell a good story.,1
"Rather, it glows warm and welcoming. Definitely one for the desert island. It is not depressing. The film is not horrifying. There is nothing ` brilliant'about this film.",1
"< br / > < br / > But, the movie isn't perfect.",1
The film is a family affair.,1
An exquisite film.,1
John Huston did a magnificent job.,1
"The party doesn't delude people for long. Only some poor things, yellowish photographs, bibelots and trinklets.... Look at Gretta. But are a human being's hopes and dreams all fulfilled? But the passage of time has partly ruined Julia's voice, first crack in the mirror.",1
10 out of 10.,1
The acting is amazing.,1
"Too bad! ) The film was aimed to teenagers, but this must be the goriest PG - rated film ever. It's campy, utterly stupid, but they just can't make these movies anymore. There is definitely a certain feel to this 80's horror genre. < br / > < br / > Note! Commentary track is interesting. Yes, we got nightmares. There's no bad language or nudity in it what so ever.",1
).,1
"< br / > < br / > 7 out of 10, kids.",1
Highly under - appreciated.,1
Horror!,1
"I don't need to own it, but I'm glad I discovered it. It seems to be a lesser - known teen horror from the 80's. I didn't know anything about this movie before I watched it.",1
"A friend found it via online search. The rotting, worm - riddled corpses look quite real. It is of the teen fright variety yet the teens are respectable in their own ways. Attention was afforded to great detail in the final scenes. < br / > < br / > The story builds over the course of the film.",1
They tell her she can be part of their little group if she spends the night in a crypt. < br / > < br / > This little film is different.,1
hello all Denver fans! It brings back all the memories.,1
"Creepy setting. What more could you want from an early 80's horror film? Enjoy. Unless, of course, Raymar got his eyes on it.",1
And it would also seem that he has a thing for jail bait. Their initiation for her consists of spending the night in a mausoleum. 7 out of 10.,1
"One Dark Night "" was completed some time before its release to theaters in 1983, where it actually did decent business during its first few weeks.",1
I thought that One Dark Night was great! It deserves a 10!,1
"This is my favorite horror film, a close 2nd to'Poltergeist '. He's selling real estate in Texas now. Kudos! Don't get me started on the cavernous silence.",1
The mausoleum makes for an impressively vast and unsettling main location. give this picture a certain endearingly quaint 80's period charm.,1
I loved it then & I still love it.,1
Heya Denver fans! thepetitionsite.,1
"Maybe someday it will be located. Also, great ending tension going in on the dark crypt opening. The special effects are excellent, though dated.",1
! Sheba will get her revenge on all those responsible for his father's death.,1
Not that Pam doesn't kick - butt in Sheba Baby.,1
"Can't, can you?",1
"I thought it would be more fantastic a tale. As usual in the "" European authors'movies "". There are clocks without hands.",1
It's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film. Destiny can be altered - and death deferred - through the characters'choices.,1
"At death's door, she requests, "" Send for David Holm! "" Once upon a time, in Sweden, there was a poor Salvation Army sister.",1
This would be Sjostrom's final performance as an actor. * * * of 4 stars. It's a genuinely creepy and frightening film for youngsters for sure.,1
It has a wonderfully eerie atmosphere.,1
This is a morality play with shades of the supernatural used to hit home its stark message. The first version is the Swedish edit under the title of THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE. The Grapevine Video release is an excellent way to do this. In America he was known as Victor Seastrom.,1
Incredible. How nightmarish. How full of despair.,1
"Plus, some of the story elements just don't make sense. < br / > < br / > As far as this film goes, it's a very mixed bag. Am I missing something? That's pretty amazing.",1
"But her unconditioned love to David will save his soul. Fulfilled with her spirit, they get to David's wife and children. Together, they drive to the stations where people live who suffered from David. Meanwhile, the Phantom Carriage is approaching. Since David refuses to get on the carriage, Georges forces him. Deplorably, it is still not available on international DVD.",1
< br / > < br / > This is a movie that is made great by its story. The message comes across as very powerful and effective.,1
"< br / > < br / > To pass the time, Holm cheerfully recites a ghost story. Little does he know, however, that he will not be alive to greet it.",1
My vote is nine.,1
"That part was not much, and ended on a somewhat stupid note. A lot of the humor is topical, so it pays to know who "" Little Egypt "" and other characters.",1
"when they interact with the "" live "" people ) are EXCELLENT! com / film / film. html nvogel.",1
This is a must - see. Victor Sjostrom's silent film masterpiece The Phantom Carriage has recently been released on DVD with a new soundtrack recorded by KTL.,1
Most highly recommend.,1
It is now his turn to take over. This film is a masterpiece to put it simply.,1
No camera mugging and no unintentional laughs due to wild - eyed arm - waving histrionics. Or even a crappy budget release. < br / > < br / > 9. One of the best silent dramas I've seen.,1
"But, this film had B - movie all over it. So if you like to laugh rent this one. Okay, so this wasnt what I was expecting.",1
"Some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure. The next woman fell on a bed of icicles. Well, you have to see it for yourself. "".",1
"Overall, Jack Frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie. The first one was better though. The screenplay was, was also atrocious. Now he is immune to anti - freeze. They say that Sam's DNA combined with Jack Frost's. Hence, here's my point. 7 out of 10.",1
"YARRR! And finally, Captain Fun. < br / > < br / > This movie has it all. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with him. like babies. Yes, killer snowballs.",1
"In other words, go see!",1
"But you have to understand, IT'S NOT A HORROR MOVIE. Jack Frost 2 is neither of these.",1

"It certainly worked for me. Okay, I'll say it.",1
"I like José Coronado in this movie, he offered us a good performance, as the rest of the crew.",1
5 out of 10.,1
It kept me on the edge of my seat.,1
"It's too bad because this movie is pretty good on its own, with good acting and writing. Of course, how could he. Thus, one could feel the tension mounting in "" Nobody's Life "" and the violent conclusion coming.",1
"Can we keep up? Will he be able to keep up with his own lies? < br / > < br / > Well done. Or that is what everybody think. Emilio is a successful business man, a perfect father and a good husband.",1
"By comparison, Truffaut is a provincial bore with nothing to say. They are Gods and Goddesses.",1
"But this disenchantment you feel throughout the whole movie is really disturbing. < br / > < br / > Oddly, "" les tricheurs "" was labeled "" nouvelle vague ""! When you know what the priests of this cinema school ( the likes of Godard ) thought of Carné, it's really a good joke. They are all smile, too sweet and to nice to be believable. Very few grown - ups appear anyway.",1
"He is almost thirty years older than his young stars, and it shows. I blow hot and cold over Carné. He really can be a puzzle for me.",1
"It went deep into me and stirred my bowels. First, I rated this movie 10 / 10.",1
"2. There is also a fine jazz score, which you can get on the CD JAZZ IN PARIS - - JAZZ & CINEMA VOL.",1
"The beautiful? Could it be the moral character? Who is the "" bad "" crowd?",1
Do so. The movie was hilarious.,1
Highly recommended.,1
One intense situation after another kept me glued to the set. Bravo. He just steals every scene that he is in. This could be my favorite grown up Corey performance.,1
Go get this one!,1
I love this film.,1
Very intense!,1
"The fate of Beth might just tell the viewer why Joan is being traumatized. Joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a particular female voice which will haunt her. I think, though, that the build - up to it works rather well.",1
"Quite a performance, I think. At least it was for me.",1
"Not as good as the Evil Dead but a close second. The makings of a real cult classic. This one is full of blood, guts and gore.",1
"And the way brother bob meets his end is more than classic. The end of this move simply could not have been better. Seen it all before, yeah right. But now i'm satisfied that at least it won't be too terrible. That truck is amazing!",1
"The final moments are a trifle weak as well. Sure it doesn't measure up to the classic gory comedies, but this still does fine.",1
I laughed myself sick!,1
This was a horror comedy that actually worked. That's it. to keep him in check.,1
The Direction is very good!. < br / > < br / > There is a lot of gore!.,1
"Big mistake! "" But they don't listen. Did I mention that Aimee Brooks is sexy? 7 out of 10.",1
He was just divine in this film.,1
"It's hard no to say that Monster Man is really entertaining. Throw in a little buddy - comedy, nice gore and intense scare. It deserves more attention in the big screen. Something that the director has shown and delivers.",1
You will absolutely LOVE it!,1
I give it a. It's also a horror comedy. Who is doing this and why?,1
"< br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) : "" Monster Man My vote is seven.",1

Why 9 / 10? Only 83mins long.,1
I will always laugh when I think of this film. ).,1
The most kick ass song they made is also on there ( Sic ).,1

I wish I knew the group's name so that I could look for it somewhere in cyberspace.,1
"1984 was the last time I saw that film, until about a month ago. He was great!",1
"Of course there are others who don't welcome the new heir back in society. < br / > < br / > For Burroughs purists, Greystoke is the real deal. I've been assured by experts. The most popular Holmes was Basil Rathbone, the most popular Tarzan was Johnny Weissmuller. As for the language of love, Tarzan and Jane need no lessons.",1
The story line in the movie was that she was an American cousin. I have seen most of the Tarzan episodes. She did not have to resort to Bo's level. The last time I checked Carolina was in the USA. He viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach.,1

Makes this picture to long. Its a well done Tarzan movie. That slow movement?,1
Ultimately it's a tragedy.,1
"He's just a personal favorite. < br / > < br / > I can't say that same, however, for his films. Woah, now, don't start getting crazy on me just yet.",1
is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most cynical critic.,1
"In the first half, we see Tarzan in his jungle environment.",1
Lambert was excellent. This is the essential Burrough's Tarzan that I grew up reading when I was a kid.,1
A sad but triumphant story told against a background of fantastic vistas.,1
"The film has some funny moments, sad moments and touching moments that makes this a real classic. John is then torn between his life as a Greystoke and Lord of the Apes.",1
"Andy MacDowell was pretty and pretty good as Tarzan's gussied - up and civilized "" Jane "" in her first movie role. The terrific Ian Holm, as a wounded Frenchman in Africa helped by Tarzan and who then escorted Tarzan back to his previously unknown, ancestral home in Scotland, was great as always.",1
"), the film - makers rather lost track of the fact that the thing was intended primarily as entertainment!",1
"The scenery is lush and exotic, and the colors are vivid. In a stunning performance, Christopher Lambert portrays this angst with absolute realism. The costumes are outstanding. It will plummet into the cheesy depths. I don't know why her voice was overdubbed, either. But Lambert never lets that happen.",1
< br / > < br / > An excellent and underrated movie.,1
So why is it only rated barely ( 6 / 10 )? The second one in England where Tarzan discovers the English society. great role. It's also an excellent rereading from a popular novel. The movie was partly made in Africa ( more precisely in Cameroon ). Its productors made Tarzan one of the most successful cinema characters. But he ignores his real origins.,1
"< br / > < br / > The special effects in here were done by Rick Baker, one of the best in the business. Sharp DVD or not, this is still a stunning film to view and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes. This is supposedly more true to the Tarzan books, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Since that time, I've seen some that topped it but it still ranks as one of the best in that department.",1
A pleasingly grim and worthwhile shocker. But Meiko manages to seriously wound Bruno before he gets away.,1
"I guess we have to. And in how many films has anyone ever done that. In fact, too bad he never tried Sartre's Nausea. Should we take the opening shot as a strange frame???",1
"Hey, he is good!! < br / > < br / > Martineau is the centerpiece of this film. Who is that boy that is perhaps not his son? Well, simply a very entertaining, fun film.",1
"< br / > < br / > Quai des Orfèvres is more human. < br / > < br / > To me, this is the greatest of Clouzot's movies. "" De Gaulle came back in 1958, as President. < br / > < br / > They both had health problems.",1
"Emily Mortimer is good as Amy and was really cute I liked her she had decent chemistry with Bruce too. The Acting is excellent!. * * * * out pf 5 ). Lily Tomlin is funny as Janet I liked her quite a bit. It's good natured and it was cool how you can see Russell's ( Willis ) character change throughout the film! plus the ending was pretty good. Overall a must see!. ( Willis Rules!!!!!!! Jean Smart is good with what she had to do, which was not much.",1
Plunging a crime situation in a picturesque environment. We can find great actors too ( Suzy Delair is impeccable ). Quai des Orfèvres inheritance is palpable in Woody Allen tradition.,1
One of the best film I ever saw.,1
He tended to adapt Steeman's books in a satiric note. It is Clouzot's most playful hour.,1
"Louis Jouvet is perfect, you just can't have a better copper. Blier is fine, if a bit one sided.",1
Maurice is furious and forbids it. Jenny is more than willing. Is it a murder mystery?,1
"His character, his eagle - like profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable. "" Enters tenacious policeman ( Louis Jouvet ) who is determined to discover the truth. """,1
"Maybe it is due to the vibrance of the dance halls and theater settings of 1940s France, which all work as the milieu of this crime thriller. Her husband and accompanist, played by Bernard Blier, is a composed but jealous man. We just don't know who did. < br / > < br / > Quay of Goldsmiths is the least dark of Henri - Georges Clouzot's films.",1
A gritty look at Paris of the time.,1
The Director loves the actress and it shows.,1
"Good for the whole family. It was brilliant, to say the least.",1
"Steeman complained about Clouzot's adaptation for both movies. Of course, the word is never uttered ( How could it be in 1947? ) So we get to know all the characters in depth.",1
Period.,1
"< br / > < br / > Bernard Blier is perfect as the jealous husband. < br / > < br / > Louis Jouvet, who is seen as a police detective, is perfect in part.",1
This is a very funny show in it's own ways. TV MA. And I love it!!! Then there's the newscaster and the pink puppet.,1
What more could you want in a kid's show!,1
He'good.,1
It's really funny and it's mostly improvised. I'm torn about this show.,1
NICE!,1
"The film ignores this. Some people are bisexual, it is true, but most tend to be either hetero - or homosexual.",1
"He degrades, not only his clients, but those close to him as well. You know that he is going to have to change before the final credits. This forces Willis to come to grips with his past and well.. you know the rest.",1
"She works with him, puts up with his'ego'and yet, she is smitten with Russell. Very much so. A small boy, who looks exactly like.... - - him. < br / > < br / > All in all this is a That's Russell Duritz.",1
"But truthfully, nobody cared. This movie is definitely worth seeing.",1
He just needs someone to show him the way. ).,1
( I refer of course to The Sixth Sense. ),1
"This is a totally awesome movie! Thus, I give it ten stars.",1
She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter ( not her father! ) They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. This is my first Deepa Mehta film.,1
That's because it was easy to find. A lot of the times the original Spanish is not much saner.,1
And the fact that it was more of an art house movie.,1
Brilliant! I am just confused about why its not in the Top 50 along with Memento.,1
The plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology. The event sequence complicates following Following.,1
"I would recommend people go to see Momento and then if they like that, see this film.",1
"You don't see these often "". Everyone's got a box "".",1
"CONTAINS "" SPOILER "" INFORMATION. < br / > < br / > A rare feminist point of view from an Indian filmmaker. They only have sex once when his closet lesbian wife loses her virginity. We come to really care about the characters and we don't see them as stereotypes. Her sari catches on fire and at first we think she is going to die. It's a better film, but this one isn't bad just different.",1
Both are great performances. Good Stuff!,1
"He finds one, Cobb ( Alex Haw ), that particularly interests him. Then, a saucy young blond ( Lucy Russell ) enters, and the movie becomes even weirder from there. I felt like someone had smacked me on the head and given me a concussion. In Memento, Nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly.",1
"Hence, it can be said that Following is a contemporary film noir, or a neo - noir.",1
"There are enough twists here which spins the film into a dizzying crescendo, where loose ends begin to come together, and the brilliance of stellar story start to shine through.",1
He follows him for a few days. The well dressed man says his name is Cobb.,1
75,1
It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists. And that is where I think the film succeeds so well. The film has many elements that led me off on many wild goose chases.,1
"Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is a memorable one. If you liked Memento,'Following'is definitely for you.",1
It's a beautifully imagined film. < br / > < br / > The script here is Nolan's finest.,1
"Bill also has an odd and strange habit, he likes to follow people.",1
"Everything supported the suspense of the plot. Great film. B & w gave it a basic, no - frills feel also.",1
I rated it 8 out of 10. The story and dialogue is really good.,1
Both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them.,1
The writing is fantastic. I can't wait for Batman.,1
"< br / > < br / > Both Mackaill ( whi had been a star in silent films ) and Bogart were trying to gain a toehold in talkies in 1932. Yet they are both very good here. Mackaill wasn't even 30 when appeared in this film! Still, he's very good and very appealing as the idealistic young inventor of a new airplane motor.",1
"Truly. I was greeted by a comment from another user, who believed that it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10, and underwhelming. I absolutely recommend this to everyone.",1
What a surprise!! Who could this NRI be?! Will Prem stop her? Rani Mukherjee is great too. !,1
"Who does one choose? A scenario found in countless other Korean films. < br / > < br / > But don't give up so quickly! "" It's like someone just pulled the plug on him.",1
Near perfect!,1
I am happy to say that Ashton is great in this part. I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater.,1
"Let's face it. < br / > < br / > Still, I like this movie.",1
"I watched it, and, damn, the fighting scenes are REALLY good. If the guys can't fight like that in real life, they sure fooled me. Meanwhile, Hea - won falls for her, and takes her as his boyfriend.",1
"< br / > < br / > And there was the excellent WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALIANT YEARS. GLORIFYING not GLAMORIZING World War II.",1
"IMDb'facts were rather skimpy, I have to find out more about him. 50, so I thought I would take another look. Many independent stations repeated them for many years. Total of 13 hours to watch it all ( 26 episodes ). Great job! The score is impressive, if a bit too much by today's standards.",1
Rent and be blessed!,1
This was a great movie.,1
"This film is titled "" Junior Pilot "" here on IMDb but "" Final Approach "" at Netflix. Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley give solid performances as well. Go figure!",1
I loved it. There is a different novel staged in each chapter.,1
I woke up at night dreaming of the Golden Pagoda.,1
"Paul Schrader and his brother Leonard wrote Mishima, and in so doing, clearly drew parallels between the life of Yukio Mishima and his work. Each of the three themes of beauty, art, and action is exemplified in the chosen depictions from the respective novels. At times, it is difficult to follow, and there may be little to recommend for the uninitiated viewer. * * * of 4 stars. The black and white scenes represent memories from Mishima's childhood and youth.",1
This film truley deserves more.,1
John Bailey's cinematography is spectacularly good.,1
"The only pure life, is one that ends with a signature in blood.",1
"This is my favourite film and I think it is perfect. I think so. Is this the definition of a work of art? Every brushstroke in Mishima is perfect and it all flows from the Schrader's script. Imagine if Schrader had directed Taxi Driver or Bringing Out The Dead, instead of Scorsese. So you wouldn't necessarily imagine that Schrader was the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty on film. I think the film shows that he was.",1
Her quiet beauty and low - key psychic suffering was excellent. ( Dar! ) Worth a look for those interested in vastly different cultures.,1
Not to mention the incredible Philip Glass Soundtrack.,1
Motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever. Ken Ogata is magnificent as Mishima. Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget by Sunday morning.,1
The Philip Glass score is mesmerizing.,1
That's the season I give the high rating to! I got to talk to Rod Rowland and James Brolin.,1
PWOG fits the bill.,1
I rate this movie 9 / 10.,1
"Ocean's twelve is probably better than Ocean's eleven. After she meets him again, she begins to follow them around. After three years, it was good seeing the gang return.",1
"Plenty. Slow? Ocean's 12 < br / > < br / >'If you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you.",1
"At least, not in the way I expected. We'll never know, because they didn't try.",1
"Clearly, he knew this from the get - go. If you want a clever heist movie, better stick with 11.",1
I felt cheated out of knowing the whole story.,1
But there are evil bad guys afoot. Marcos likes to kill people.,1
Easy as pie.,1
Just brace yourself for low budget and no blood. Hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie!?! ? I loved this movie!,1
"When the guy left the pub, the priest then hung up the phone and was was laughing at Jeffrey. This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life. His evil and cold blooded facial expressions before he massacred his victims were so real, I was shivering in my seat.",1
"Can you withstand an independent, low - budget film? And while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low, you will see the results. Well, if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one. It isn't a glamorized, unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film "" Dahmer "" ( 2001 ) was.",1
"SPOILER ALERT! < br / > < br / > I think this film had a lot beneath its shell. < br / > < br / > Their relationship is one thing, but the girl's mother is entirely different. In my humble opinion.",1
"I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. Now, I hope the kids today enjoy the show. Life seemed so much simpler and better.",1
This was so much better than a lot of the kid shows today.,1
""", also, "" Sunshine "", and "" The Point. "" Should be on DVD. One of the best memories of my childhood.",1
! OhMyGAWD!!,1
It's a good one!,1
The priest finds that he needs blood to survive. Unfortunately all is not well.,1
"I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. I look forward to seeing more of Ash Christian, Ashley Fin and Jonathan Caouette soon.",1
& the scenery is gorgeous. He is still living & I wish him well. they made a nice team. He made only a few more movies.,1
David Carradine is John's son. The second was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. He looks hauntingly like his father.,1
True!,1
).,1
"good series, check it out. This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series.",1
It hurt.,1
"Thirst is no exception. The soundtracks to Park's films always seem to fit its respective film like a glove. Nevertheless, it is my one nitpick of the film. He doesn't, however, have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror.",1
"Boy who one day may save world.... or maybe not. However, being unique as it is.",1
She also dresses completely unprofessionally. It certainly isn't that I like naked cartoon girls. < br / > < br / > The formula is the same for each episode. He IS the Goldenboy. < br / > < br / > Episode # 1 features a rich software tycoon.,1
< br / > < br / > Definitely the funniest! One of the best I've seen. ( I laughed so hard! ),1
It's hilarious.,1
"The score is suitably overwrought. Pretty brunette Rachel Carter pops her top and bares cute little breasts. Okay, it sure ain't no sophisticated work of cinematic art.",1
"This movie has a veritable cast of thousands. Clever device, no? < br / > < br / > Jack - O himself was pretty sweet. Oh yeah!",1
< br / > < br / > I recommend it. Of course. I don't need a director to use new tricks.,1
The cast. If so? As for the effects? Watch 3colours blue instead.,1
Acting was better than average for a low budget film.,1
I loved this movie!,1
"75 seconds ), and some relation to the story. that is it for props. did he feel himself losing control? why?",1
The script? Well it ; a game of 2 halfs. This will doubtless annoy others as it annoyed me.,1
"I like the e - pods - they're an excellent idea done very well and make more sense than a nice, roomy escape capsule. On many levels it's very good.",1
Did they edit out the water? Awesome!,1
"< br / > < br / > Check out the rest of our review at www.filmstage. Well, anything that isn't I'm a Cyborg at least.",1
Nevertheless - - - - This is top fun film making. !,1
It's THAT type of movie.,1
"Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. Not that this ever bothered me anyway, since I love low budget sci - fi like Dr Who, Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Big man Mike Mitchell is a good stand in for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn. < br / > < br / > Some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end, but I like it.",1
WOW!! Talk about a film that divides the audience! Personally I really enjoyed it. This is a real love it or loath it kinda movie. But his gun is AWESOME!!,1
It sounds like very standard Sci - Fi fare mixing elements of Aliens. < br / > < br / > As for the team of mercenaries the cast excels themselves.,1
"And for a snip of a price as well. The Planet "" is an astounding piece of film making. The detail and the movement is superb, and captures the imagination from the off. Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen looks a desolate and lonely place. The use of light and costume add further to the professional look.",1
"left, and new ones appeared like Marie, Kai, Cora or John.",1
).,1
"Now only Claude, Jose and Peter are left. But in turn he is killed himself by one of the fish - men. The boat hits some rocks and is torn apart.",1
I didn't think so.,1
The central plot follows a boat which crashes on a small island. The biggest location standout in the film is definitely the lost city of Atlantis.,1
Has anyone ever seen this footage?,1
"Give it a look. The acting is so - so, but the film is fast - paced and entertaining. 8 out of 10.",1
The things that we see in life...,1
All that's missing is parrot. Claudio comes across the stellar Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson. Talk about economic filmmaking!,1
"It's a sumptuous, handsome Euro Horror outing with a brain, good plotting, character development, location shooting, period costuming and sets, etc.",1
All this and much more in one simple movie? See it!,1
"< br / > < br / > As luck would have it, the two con men stumble into the lady's shady business when no one is home. Plus, while creepy and strange, I liked seeing Pollard dressed like a lady. ).",1
"So on that note, I recommend Are Crook Dishonest?",1
He was the much bigger celebrity at this period and gave her many hints for getting ahead in Hollywood. < br / > < br / > The film was made with full cooperation of the War Department. Haines & Crawford made five silent feature films together and were tremendous friends for life.,1
"West Point is a winner! Great, rousing entertainment by MGM in this Haines formula film, shows Billy at his best. William Bakewell also scores as skinny follower.",1
"< br / > < br / > As to the score : it was appropriately martial. Perhaps Haines'character went too far, or got away with too much. Where's "" the Corps "" in that? It rather lessened the viewing experience. But, there was a distinct over - use of snare drums. I was ready to say "" I GET THE POINT ALREADY. """,1
He needs and deserves to be remembered!,1
The movie was long to begin with.,1
"This is where Lawman most resembled Gunsmoke. And I wasn't smallest of children when Lawman was in first run. It was one of the best. < br / > < br / > Sadly Peggie Castle developed substance abuse problems after Lawman's run ended. He was pretty handy with a shooting iron, but was inclined to be impulsive.",1
I hope I can find some episodes for my grandchildren to watch.,1
They sound like today's stats ). Just to see Billy in his younger days is worth seeing. It's an awesome movie.,1
< br / > < br / > A Philip Glass soundtrack superbly compliments the film.,1
"Too much talk about cosmos would make one's head hurt, and too much about his personal life and one might wonder what all the fuss is about this bloke who's book of the film's title was on bestseller lists for over five years. But he also captures the back - story on the man and his condition, which creates this as something much more interesting than if Morris had done one or the other.",1
A brief history of time.,1
But it's a great movie. Awesome.,1
"He has contributed more to Science, despite his debilitating disease, ALS, than an able bodied Scientist could only dream of. ! as Hawking puts it. This is why i love this film and why isay it is a MUST SEE!!",1
def. the strange to comprehend yet darkly intriguing! i hate vampire movies.,1
An interesting and proud story.,1

Do not hesitate See it. < br / > < br / > This movie is not what you would expect. We all know what Chan - wook Park can do.,1
"< br / > < br / > What absorbs me the most in this film is its aspect as a gangster film. It is impressionistic and subjective, as I say, but its intent, its force and its spirit are much closer to home.",1
But quite dated today. She swings from irritating to melodramatic and is far too over the top. < br / > < br / > 7 out of 10. Worth seeing. Sinatra truly deserved his Oscar nomination.,1
The film received three Academy Award nominations.,1
< br / > < br / > It's very rare that a film has so many great character performances as this one does.,1
That is how much this movie has affected me.,1
His yearning to come off it is his only motivation towards a happy ending.,1
"Like Mean Streets, it's hard to escape the minutia unless you leave.",1
Don't miss either one of them.,1
< br / > < br / > Loved the jazz score by Elmer Bernstein! Loved Kim Novak! ).,1
"* * * Spoiler in fifth paragraph * * * This was an amazingly frank ( uh - huh, uh - huh ) picture for 1955. Ultimately it's not just Frankie who has the addiction, everyone and everything seems to be dependent on him and he feels it keenly. All in all these gambles paid off, the movie is a classic, though it's not perfect.",1
The involvement of human beings in the process is almost incidental.,1
Elmer Bernstein's score is one of the best of its time. The ending is a little too pat. The actors are uniformly fine.,1
I know I was!,1
So it wasn't faithful to the book? by forty years! What movie is?,1
Highly recommended.,1
). Also I thought about love.,1
"When it comes to movies, "" The Man with the Golden Arm "" heads that list. < br / > < br / > Then you come to Sinatra.",1
"The Caligari sets alone make it unbelievable. What, one wonders, was Preminger up to, and why did he do the movie this way? Parker is pure Hollywood and very hard - working as the crippled and crafty Zosch. She is never convincing, but then neither is the film.",1
"< br / > < br / > However, Preminger pulls it off without becoming exploitative. ).",1
I read his biography on the IMDB. Well... it was!,1
1955 marked the high point of her career. It's the only flaw I find in the film. His performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl. But I think of the three this one is the best. But a whole lot of people are conspiring against him. He uses a few underhanded methods to get Sinatra's services back. The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain.,1
"Frankie tries to getaway from the life that he lead but has this monkey or, better yet, gorilla on his back that just won't let him. Soild performances by the entire supporting cast starting with Frankie's friend Sparrow, Arnold Stang. And then there's Frankie's next - door neighbor and friend Molly, Kim Novak, ( Mild Spoilers ) Frankie Machine had been dealt a bad hand in life.",1
"As such, the film may seem dated. Arnold Stang is another unlikely survivor of street. She is compassionate and yet stands on solid ground. The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is really good. Darren McGavin plays a slimy character and does it very well.",1
7 out of 10.,1
"It's that simple, and that complex, at the same time. < br / > < br / > You gotta give him credit.",1
It was excellent. The vision of this city is really stunning. The whole idea made me think about our society. This movie is a ballet of awesome visual display.,1

That what they feel is love doesn't come across till the end.",1

"Now, obviously the show has changed, but this is still interesting. At first, when watching this, I did not sense as much sarcasm as there was in this. It shows what goes on behind the scenes with the animation and the recording. Not rated, contains Language and Sexual Content. Clips from both of Trey Parker's Spirit of Christmas shorts are shown, as are many good clips from the show. 51 mins.",1
I started to like it.,1

When Det. * * SPOILERS * * Extremely brutal police drama set in San Francisco involving a sting operation that goes terribly wrong.,1
Much of the dialog is just plain silly. When good actors take on bland material! He makes it fun for us too. Ah! He plays the eccentric police captain.,1

The first is the excellent horror A Tale of Two Sisters.,1

"When I was younger, and today, Mr. Bean is a work of genius. Outstanding!",1
"< br / > < br / > The comedy series... definitely really wicked, as what the Brits may be saying. Shocked instantly. < br / > < br / > There are more reasons than one why I love watching Mr Bean.",1
"The character actors all played there roles really well, especially Robyn Driscoll and Matilda Ziegler ( as Irma ). This show is incredibly popular, and i can definitely see why, as it's quite possibly the funniest show ever.",1
"< br / > < br / > However, MR. BEAN is, hands down, the greatest sitcom of the 1990s. But no real harm comes to anyone at end of the day and outcomes are always reassuring. And naturally some of his methods to completing a single task often result in disaster, which we then see Mr. Bean try to resolve. Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things his own way. It is for this reason why the TV series This is where the humour derives from.",1
""", "" What's wrong?",1
It was worth it because we watched them over and over again!,1
10 / 10 These escapades never get old!,1
10 out of 10. the way he handled that situation was simply mind blowing. Mr. Bean has always been my favorite.,1
"It may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some. But the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory. < br / > < br / > All in all, be warned that this is neither art cinema nor horror flick. '",1
He is often alone and used to it.,1
"Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius! Who? "" and the New Year Party.",1
Though he barely spoke any coherent words his jovial actions more than made up for this.,1
... the last time I laughed this much.,1
"In other words, Mr. Bean is a walking disaster! Nonetheless, it is a classic series, and deserves its wide appeal! """,1
"And I find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early 20s as I did when I was a young boy in early 90s. As others have noted, it looks like he may have a type of autism. Shows like Little Britain do work because it's well realised but it's really just as vulgar as the rest.",1
"< br / > < br / > ANYHOW, enough of this background already! He had never become an American Citizen. It was high time to get old films out of the mothballs and back out to the Movie Houses. That's what the promotional guy called it when we saw him on somebody's old talk show. ( No Schultz, he's NOT from another Planet! )",1
This is great for several reasons. Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his full - length features.,1
"Being the only one out of five hundred to survive, he becomes quite the celebrity to those who know him and all he wants is to get back to normal. All thanks to the blood he was transfused with.",1
"I haven't seen such angry seas since "" The Perfect Storm "". While the underlying "" general "" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent.",1
The shorts are still worth 10 '.,1
"During the 1950s this attitude gradually began to change for a number of reasons. These three movies happened to work well as a trio since they contrast nicely in plot, theme, and setting.",1
who cares about the plot or the acting. this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it.,1
"! cking moron, and some of Fulci's hallucination sequences.",1
"As a matter of fact some of those scenes are quite disgusting. For the others it may be too much. Haven't seen The Beyond ). If I would make love films, no - one would buy tickets... "" ). I also like the simplicity of the photography / pictures in this film. Actually, the script is overally, to my opinion, quite ingenious. Is it art? This is an interesting movie.",1
"Make no mistake : "" Cat in the Brain "" is a total gorefest, and as disjointed as Fulci's previous films, but it deserves credit for trying to be something more.",1
Fulci... < br / > < br / > Fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. Even the Braindead didn't stop it. CITB is all about gore. He is such a brilliant director.,1
"Coincidently (? ) Until I saw it here, I could only imagine what it looked like. His rabid fan - base will probably love it.",1
"In this time, the doctor begins a long chain of serial crimes. This is probably his goriest film, and unfortunately one the last.",1
"This has a shower murder Hitchcock never could direct, or probably want to. I can only wish this was his final film because that's a perfect close if there ever was one. and can not seem to deprive his mental well being from constant murder. I know ) during running time.",1
"Some of you may take that as a minus, but in reality it's a big plus. The great thing about Thirst, Chanwook Park's latest film, is that it's the anti - Twilight.",1
"It is a visual experience, no doubts about it. Years of violent film making have finally began to reach him.",1
"Un Gatto nel Cervello "" / "" Cat in the Brain "" is one of the goriest horror movies ever made. Highly recommended, especially if you like extreme cinema! """,1
Fulci takes the lead role of the film ( obviously ). Bad dubbing doesn't exactly help either.,1
"The gore is overpowering and copious, to say the least. He quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom.",1
"This is an exercise in craziness, people...",1
"Dark and engrossing, it will pull in crowd. One I'd recommend you give a try.",1
The film lacks in action. Closet land is not at happy movie. For some people a nice touch.,1
"She is increasingly subjected to physical and mental torture. She refuses. A simple little act. It should be seen, though.",1
"Not flawless and definitely not for everyone, but rewarding. The plot is distinctly original and the actors are two of my absolute favourites. Just don't expect any overexplicit sermons or eyefilling action sequences. In the end, I found the whole thing fascinating.",1
"So the horror is always unexpected, and brutal.",1
It really is that good.,1
It could be profoundly transformative.,1
We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place. Especially when you have absolutely no control over it.,1
"< br / > < br / > But it didn't turn out horribly. Acting, of course!",1
The set is incredible.,1
I was also happy that Park did not CG the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little CG at all. That was a nice effect. Don't expect Oldboy and stylization because that's not what you'll get here.,1
Closet Land.,1
Anyway this made for TV movie is good for a few laughs.,1
"Not as depressing as it could have been, this is kitchen - sink at its most dirty.",1
Pefectly set to Donovan's dulcet tones.,1
"Her name is Joy, but she experiences no joy in her life.",1
"until I caught up in the 80 '. I just heard of his successes, "" Kes "", "" Family Life "", "" Black Jack "".",1
Plus this is the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yet.,1
"It's definitely a better movie than the average'later'Columbo movie entry. If it ain't broke don't fix it. It doesn't make the movie They had some nice sequences together. It got used before in the 1975 movie "" Columbo : Playback "".",1
You find your self looking for the answers along with Marquette. This movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths.,1
Try to get a copy of it and see for yourself!,1
What a great short film!,1
I gave this 9 stars out of a possible 10. < br / > < br / > Nonetheless it is a highly interesting film.,1
< br / > < br / > SF I'm sure we'll be seeing Emily in more films in the future. Fantastic film! More films like this are * exactly * what we need.,1
The same cannot be said of Daybreakers or New Moon. Don't let me convince you that the film has no inclinations. I've reviewed many and have a few more to discuss. There are two ways to dissect it.,1
With perfect akwardness. The acting was top notch! I think it would do phenominally!,1
"She then meets a personable older couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. Beware!!. Her sleazy boss propositions her - she quits and takes a little bit of cash from the register. at the story. Especially I - 95. You will enjoy this film.",1
Small cast. Great independent film.,1
Way to go.,1

It's 6.,1
"But, no. Bill has a comical face and is retired from the Army. Bill and Sandra keep her money in the safe where customers aren't going to find it. They guide her.",1
"This is a very amazing movie! The characters seemed so realistic to me, it was hard to believe they weren't real people. It is rather vulgar and disturbing at times, even if it is not completely sad in the end.",1
"She gives one of the best performances of the year. The film is also perversely hilarious. But when it works, man, does fly. OK - vin Kim should become a worldwide star after this film.",1
"It is a sad story, though.",1
"This is a low budget, well acted little gem. She sets out for Florida and to stay with her wealthier high school friend who is a freshman at Miami.",1
There is not a false note in her character choices. But is she really a better person?,1
"Her fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. Alice leaves the motor home with her well - earned money and a feeling of mutual respect. The book's complete title is "" Through the Looking - Glass ( And What Alice Found There ) "". Prostitution is everywhere. This is how things really are. The man is shy and deferential and apologizes for "" finishing "" too fast.",1
"What Alice Found "" was a pleasant discovery.",1
"Altogether this is a pretty entertaining diversion for mean spirited trash fans, especially those with a taste for Japanese rapey adventures.",1

8 / 10.,1
Bowlsby is a master of the put - down... ( I've heard they are coming soon. ),1
I have to say that I was very pleased when I finally had the chance to see the show.,1
"It does a good job of being that. With the "" Jofa "" brand - name still visible? Okay, there's a lot of that in Commander's Log, but it's cute.",1
It's fun to watch.,1
"1. Is any of this filmable? While watching, we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Aschenbach No.",1
"If you'll like it or not... that'a different story, very personal one. Why? It must be seen more than twice with the mind that is constantly open. All is doomed to fade, to wither like flowers on meadow when their time comes.",1
Dirk Bogarde gives his finest screen performance - he himself believed so.,1
Sometimes the story flow was clunky. The use of color stands out most. The cinematography was well above excellent.,1
"Or flee Venice to save his own life? In his flashback, after paying the prostitute, Gustav is clearly physically seized by the consequences of his actions. This reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that Tadzio represents.",1
"It is a monument in movie history. < br / > < br / > Life was slow then, compared to now.",1
7 / 10 A film to divide its viewers.,1
"His music, especially what we hear of it here, is very slow. It's a great work. Death in Venice "" isn't one of them. I much prefer the former.",1
"In short, it was a disappointing movie. Or the creation of Alfred who I don't remember in the book. I'm not sure where to start with this.",1
Easily one of the best films of 2009.,1
But what movie hasn't been remade a million times. I'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard. This isn't the case. < br / > < br / > I hope you enjoy the movie.,1
"I give it 10 stars, up from the 3 I gave it night I saw it. You know what?",1
"I suppose by the standards of Hollywood pap, these comments contain merit. Visconti's masterpiece! You will be rewarded.",1
< br / > < br / > I don't like explicit films. Now there's one thing never to do.,1
It is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made. He too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures.,1
"Unable to catch one delight, he settles for another - which poisons him. It is very subtle in the book, but it is there. The chase in Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way.",1
"It's like an allusion to Shakespeare's sonnets, and it doesn't feel heavy - handed. But here, that is part of the point - - Gustav surrounded by a visual din. It's the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that.",1
"The streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting filth and rot, the city decays in step with the protagonist. But Visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of Venice. Should we not perish and become consumed by love? "" Only through the flashbacks are we allowed a glimpse of why this famous composer is a frail and innocuous man.",1
And an agonize Venice. A victim? No way! And the essence is the music.,1
The character borders on a kind of black widow film noir type. This is a really smooth and nervy performance. She careens from innocent to impish to vixen to demon with utter conviction.,1
"But then what else would you expect with a title like that? For those who love Venice, this is a film to cherish. Who knows? The mood it creates is not always happy.",1
"Are sea side resorts the sad, dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels? Perhaps Tadzio reminds him of what he could have been and now knows he never will be. A pedophile?",1
Great story and a Bogarde Classic. In the end.,1
"The pacing is a challenge : slow, but never without emotional weight. "" Incidents "" are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in aturm - und - drang cosmos.",1
I think both. Was it bless or curse for him? He became addicted to him ; he fell in love with him.,1
Good viewing fun.,1
It's very cool and entertaining.,1
So what does one expect? I was was very entertained. But that was part of the charm of the movie. Hitchcock?,1
I loved it.,1
One thing that I liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry. Thank god for that!,1
"Why did they do that? "" I thought the film was fun.",1
It is a lot better than the movie 2010.,1
"if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though. that's okay for a film like this. < br / > < br / > Second, the changes from book to film. However the BIG TWIST is still there so don't worry about that.",1
I cannot say enough about score. He had me convinced right until the very end. The minor actors also do very good jobs.,1
< br / > < br / > It rates an 8. < br / > < br / > I like Hanks as Robert Langdon.,1
"The action taking place in the Vatican, it felt like vacation. < br / > < br / > I really like debate between science and religion.",1
"Who doesn't love Hanks? Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind. "" Possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written!",1
"You see neither of it in movie. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good.",1
< br / > < br / > The interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders.,1
"Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Some minor details are are also cut from the movie. Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving Vatican archives. I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company.",1
"I go to the movies to be entertained. But hey, it's a movie.",1
"But, maybe not something too special for Dan Brown fans.",1
< br / > < br / > The movie itself runs at an uneven pace.,1
"The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one.",1
I think the whole cabin would be dead.,1
"if you liked the episode ICE I advice you to see it. the plot is simple but exiting. Soon none can tell who they can trust, or who's infected or not. It has the abilities to imitate any life form.",1
Great job in all accounts.,1
"This episode certainly works at portraying the way that tensions can cause breakdowns in groups. Visually, color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality. This gives rise to the inevitable scene of testing.",1
All works. I WANTED MORE!,1
Events lead to finding out the one who is infected and learning how to cure them. A little worm that gets into the bloodstream and causes violent behavior. Its a shame he has to die.,1
Wow! It's my favorite of the season.,1
Tension is that high.,1
Highly recommended.,1
"Needless to say, their lives sucked. The ones who refused to fight were executed on sight. This isn't a bad TV movie.",1
"It features a colorful and varied group of people, thrust into a situation from which there is no escape. One can almost call it the Russian equivalent of highly acclaimed "" Band of Brothers "" miniseries.",1
Shtrafbat is the story only Russians could tell about the Second World War.,1
"It becomes completely about character at points, and then keeps up the thrills. < br / > < br / > You almost wonder in all the exhilaration of the camera flying by the trees at a high speed with the car that he might just make it.",1
See it!,1
The ultimate gritty heist film.,1
They round up the usual suspects for the job. Rififi is a great film that is overlooked.,1
"What a gas of a movie! "" ). Dassin picked right guy ( Jean Servais ) for that role.",1
"For once, I can say that film is not predictable! Ten stars!",1
The brilliance of this film is the 1 / 2 hour during the robbery. This increases the suspense and draws you in. - P. Melville's films in this genre. myspace. 7.,1
"< br / > < br / > Bleak, nasty, and downbeat, "" Bloody Birthday "" is worth a look for the curious.",1
"Leave the classics alone! The plot is simple, but engrosses you. No other heist film has come close to it, before or after.",1
"But Cesar's womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned. < br / > < br / > The heist goes off without a hitch. Thankfully that scene occurs off camera, but you are not likely to forget it. I have been wanting to see this since my French teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago.",1
"The fact that after 50 years, it is still a highly watchable movie, says a lot about it.",1
Nothing is left to chance. < br / > < br / > A great film by a great director.,1
BIG QUESTIONMARK. And then? Then they murder Mario and his Wife.,1
"It goes like clockwork, with a fine sense of craft and teamwork among the robbers. The new Rififi DVD includes a recent interview with Dassin. Some nosy cops are efficiently dealt with.",1
No kiddin! ts as the murderers.,1
That is why they adhere to a strict code of honor.,1
"Actually, an American, Jules Dussain, shot the film, so it's not entirely a European film. A warning for those not expecting profanity or nudity in a classic film. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. The best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography. This is France, not the United States, so there is a little bit of both in here. < br / > < br / > In fact, I thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist.",1
"Everything goes well and the gang gets away with the jewels. Jules Dassin was penniless in Paris when he discovered the city that were going to serve as the background to his film. < br / > < br / > When we first meet Tony, he is playing cards.",1
It portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with. It shows that a heist is hard work and ultimately not worth doing.,1
A classic.,1
"Then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so. ( Here we have Remi Grutter, played by Robert Hossein, a slightly sadistic druggie. ) < br / > < br / > Probably Or vice - versa.",1
My vote is ten.,1
Whatever one's opinion of the film.,1
But they can't go on fooling everyone.,1
"A masterpiece in acting, cinematography, directing, editing, and writing. Remarkable Noir picture that defines 1950s French Cinema. Builds up tense situations with precise craftsmanship.",1
"Saddened, shaking your head. Ditto for the music. 3 cheer to a young writer / director.",1
Owen could have been a good influence. lbs of him!,1
I do hope he as well as our 2 lads have long career. < br / > < br / > Choose Conner is one of those films. For a first effort a big thumbs up.,1
"Overall, a movie worth my highest praise! Thank you for making it and redefining my view on the death penalty. I cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me!",1
"In the movie Wajda changes point of view. After few years he committed suicide. Marches, patriotic kitsch mixed with hunting for the extra dose of food and / or prostituting German girls.",1
"In comes women, and with them film changes light, colour and temper. The Grunwald intermezzo speaks for itself. < br / > < br / > Film makes an important turn. A touching opening. Anyhow, there is also another scene I can't let go without comment.",1
I also changed this one scene.,1
Andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. This movie is a violent black humor movie. My vote is seven.,1
That was really cool. Even they got me on that scenes. Is it full moon tonight? I give this movie 5 stars out of 6. I'm a horror - movie - lover. OH!,1
< br / > < br / > there were a lot of wisecracks in the movie which i thought were good.,1
This movie is great. That kid's vicous!,1
"Bravo! But I was shocked. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. No, its not an Oscar worthy movie.",1
"I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. With that said, this is still a very entertaining film to watch and I do recommend it.",1
!,1
"So as a sequel, AAwiP fails, one would say. It doesn't look too cheap or fake to me. Perfect for fans of werewolves! They have good chemistry together. 7 out of 10 stars! It's one of the better werewolf films I have seen in a long time too.",1
"I liked it even though I agree "" London "" is better and I prefer that version, too. I don't see enough of this actress. This film is geared a lot more toward 20 - somethings, if that helps anyone.",1
"He is helped out by exceptional work from his supporting cast. Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee as Todd'best friends, and Jeffrey Tabor as his father. Whoever heard of a mature teen movie?",1
"< br / > < br / > What really surprised me was acting. Where those really fashionable in 1995? Todd's mother is slightly insane ( on the phone 24 / 7 ), his Dad doesn't find her attractive ( any more? ) ( Well the title did give that away, wouldn't you think? ) Did anyone else notice how none of the loves are happy ones in this film? A shame really that we as the audience knew who Vicky Mueller really was. That first meeting across the lake magical.",1
"So off to the phones. But is this really journalism? That said, Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but alas, he is not a great one. And I notice he usually has seen the star's latest movie.",1
"I've been a fan of Larry King's show for awhile, I think he does a terrific job overall and I don't think he ever'wusses'out, as so many people seem to believe. King asked, gently, more than once, if she does not feel she creates the situations in her life that she "" finds "" herself in, to which she pretty much stared at him blankly. He's a subtle Scorpio, he gets his zings in when he needs to, just as he managed to do last night with Paris Hilton, during her first post - jail TV interview. with a resounding yes.",1
"I know I said that before, but I'm truly surprised by this. it doesn't really have unintentionally funny scenes. < br / > < br / > Like I was saying before,'Bloody Birthday'is surprisingly NOT funny. But trust me, the movie manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most part.",1
"Perhaps it was even designed to be a two - reeler. Harry doesn't want to cheat, but he can't do anything about it. It is one of his funniest and best films.",1
Or do they?,1
"Whether or not he makes you laugh, the guy is mesmeri Langdon moved like no one else. Does this sound familiar? And perhaps a little dreary?",1
"< br / > < br / > I like that they've given the characters so much depth. With her talent, Billie will go far in industry.",1
"But in the case of Dr Who, they saved the best parts. I'm gushing.. but this should be on everyoneci - fi geeks list. !",1
But the new show is impressive.,1
"1. He, and his crew, are clearly all true devotees of the original series.",1
"( July 4th can't come soon enough! The writing is excellent, the acting superb. Compared to the original, it's got some now.",1
"- Fantastic! "" I gave it a chance though, and am so glad I did.",1
He is the 9th Doctor. I've played them over and over. It was a complete success. We have already seen that he is a great actor.,1
Veteran star Susan Strasberg does well as the teacher and Jose Ferrer has a cameo appearance.,1
It's sad to see him go.,1
"Well, this is NO MORE TRUE.",1
"For those awaiting series 3 abroad, the wait is is well worth it.",1
As soon as the credits rolled on Saturday night you could feel it in the air that the doctor was most definitely back! < br / > < br / > With this new series it brings with it substences in which the previous version of the show lacked.,1
Easily as good as Tom Baker. Watch it and buy DVD.,1
"< br / > < br / > The writing is grand, the acting superb, the directing ( which was dreadful in the old days ) is just fantastic. Okay, I grew up on Who, but haven't loved a Doctor since Tom Baker. 2 ) That Eccleston left so quickly, he really made the show brilliant. She gives that to me.",1
"then it all came to a sudden halt. now, now, calm down tom baker fans! Christopher Eccleston is by far the most believable doctor to date. < br / > < br / > 2008 update - i love David tennant!",1
!,1
"I have just watched the season 2 finale of Doctor Who, and apart from a couple of dull episodes this show is fantastic.",1
"This Doctor, on other hand, earned my loyalty with his stratified personality. I can't believe what I've been missing out on, seriously, why had no one told me about this before? I quite liked all the aliens but my favourite had to be the Daleks ; if I ever knew I also loved Christopher Eccleston. Honestly, i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to any future episodes. And I don't think they did a bad job with what they had.",1
"It's definitely good. Some of the stories "" Dalek "" were very poor.",1
It looked like the honeymoon was over. The new'Dr.,1
"In fact this new series of DOCTOR WHO must have been the most hyped programme in the history of British television, it had better be bloody good < br / > < br / > So was it bloody good?",1
But I'm willing to give the new guy a chance. < br / > < br / > A good show. I have to say that the new show works very well.,1
! I love show. I love the new Dr.,1
See it out at all costs.,1
"< br / > < br / > My favorite thing of all about the series : The stories. First off, I never got into Dr. Who until recently. His sharp acting and physical comedy is almost flawless. < br / > < br / > The production and direction of the show is top notch. Then there's David Tenannt. Writing folks, is always the key to great entertainment.",1
I loved this show.,1
I think it was a hasty move to cancel.,1
And was very surprised that it didn't aired. I live on the island of Aruba. Although i can not vote. I sat down to see the show on tuesday.,1
Wow. What a beautiful and touching film!,1
Its great and kids will love it. Its a joy to look at. THe insects enemy is man.,1
Fair question. You almost don't even need spoken lines. It has a good message ( two actually ). < br / > < br / > My answer : Partially.,1
"I don't know who hired the 3 kids but they did a good job. And not just any nudity, but a topless dance - act by MTV - VJ Julie Brown. < br / > < br / > Bloody Birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt.",1
"In fact, the first in the highly acclaimed SUPERMAN series was already in release. When HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insect neighbors in the Lowlands. Technically it is well made, with animation of a generally high quality.",1
"). and Smack the mosquito ), and the amazing night club scene.",1
"Swat's voicing by Jack Mercer ( of Popeye fame ) is priceless. < br / > < br / > Do not miss Mr. Bug Goes To Town... aka Hoppity Goes To Town. "" I'll wager you'll be bug eyed at the results! < br / > < br / > Do not miss this wonderfully hand drawn film.",1
Take note Pixa.,1
That was fantastic animation! You feel like you've stepped back into time.,1
I located a reference to the movie on the web.,1
"The film was to have had its premiere on Dec. 7th, 1941, the date of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The animation is great, and many of the characters are very cute. The film was called a family favorite by most of the major American newspapers.",1
"I first watched this in black and white, circa Christmas in the early Sixties, when it was shown on British television. < br / > < br / > To compound their problems, devious insect'property magnate'C. ).",1
"- - Something unimaginable in these typically short - run, quick to - DVD days. < br / > < br / > I wanted to comment, also, that the film actually debuted December 4, 1941, not December 7. Mr. Bug provided them the pretext to do just that. - - The sad closing of a great quirky, innovative chapter in American animation.",1
< br / > < br / > * * * * out of 4 stars Who knows?,1
It's just beautiful. This was one of many of his other films.,1
She appeared there until 1912.,1
This one is worth looking for....,1
"And I do mean Emotion with a capital E! What a wonderful, glorious pageant of color and music and raw Emotion!",1
Kathleen Kuhlmann in the Contessa. You should have too!,1
"It this comment containspoilers, I am unaware of it. She sent me an autographed photo. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long.",1
Mr James Robertson Justice is just a tad unbelievable as the bosun. It was fun. But it is Miss Peters who stays in the memory.,1
This movie was much better than I expected. Louis Jordan was a bit weak. But it's basically cheesy.,1
This movie is wonderful melancholic.,1
"Anne begins planning revenge on both of them but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a great sacrifice in order to save them instead. 7 / 10 The pirate movie cliché figure of ` Black Beard'also makes his appearance here, this time played by Thomas Gomez.",1
"It was in 1988 that Chuck Norris saw this film at Cannes International Film Festival. 5 ) "" has universal connotations. This is because the events depicted in Dekalog 5 can happen in any part of world.",1
"< br / > < br / > The film wasn't sympathetic, per se. It's still working inside me. It doesn't need to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing. What I thought before really isn't worth getting into. Identity.... Much of that meaning makes sense only in retrospect.",1
"While his work kept the same high quality, it wasn't really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed. Everything ends at dawn, and just when the sun is about to rise again, the skeletons run towards their graves. A lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra : it's hard to dance with loose body parts.",1
"Really in the name of the innocent ones? "".",1
"With such vile characters, I found myself almost glad that they would receive some sort of punishment. It'a fantastic film and, typical of Kieslowski, absolutely stunning.",1
His way of killing is more a desire to control death than it is any desire to actually destroy.,1
Nothing can prevent the court to condemn to death the young man. The lawyer feels at the end he has failed his client and goes to the judge to see where he went wrong. All he is asked by the young man is to retrieve the picture and send it to his mother.,1
We are made to imagine that this must have been the case.,1
Before the Broadway phenomenon of the mid - 60's.,1
"and "" Starting Here, Starting Now "" among them. The juxtaposition of locale and song is even more effective than in her first special, and a 23 - year old Streisand is in peak form.",1
"She stops to admire various paintings and statues, often becoming the character that is depicted and singing a thematically appropriate song. Not surprisingly, she succeeded once again.",1
I still think so!,1
"As he stands in the room, her family holding him back, she makes the call for divorce and he gets a heart attack right there. If Cassavetes were a crazy German he might make this film, maybe even as just a lark.",1
"You are constantly on outside, looking in. Fassbinder employs his actors in an almost vehement "" Anti - Natural'style. The storyline is fairly straightforward.",1
"who'd have thought ). < br / > < br / > Still, this is Fassbinder, and you get your fix here.",1
"< br / > < br / > First, it's highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love pushed him into signing up with the Foreign Legion. In fact, he is more brutal in her presence. Why?",1
The Merchant of Four Seasons is a film about a lack of love. Both films are downtrodden and gritty - yet realistic pieces of art.,1
Everything about this movie is magnificent!,1
?,1
It is also based on a true story. I recommend this TV film to all without hesitation.,1
This is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production. This is a movie that I loved growing up in the midwest.,1

That is without a doubt the legacy this movie will leave.,1
"are found throughout. Songs like "" Johnny, Are You Queer? """,1
This movie is as good as gold!,1
Nicolas Cage at his best. For sure.,1
It isn't just a good 80'teen flick. Period.,1
I feel honored just have beheld such a great film.,1
Nicolas Cage is just brilliant here. The music was GREAT. Bizarre! ).,1
After it ended I wanted to talk with someone about it immediately. Every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it. I am eagerly awaiting it's release on DVD if they ever release it. It was 1983 and I was 13. His friend Fred is pretty funny too. Turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie. Although it is for me personally. It is one of Nicholas Cage's first movies and his first starring role.,1
!,1
"Run, don´ walk!",1
I LOVE this movie.... and have the DVD on order!,1
The production design is top notch. Gee!,1
"And, regarding the poor reviews don't pay any attention.",1
This movie is so cool.,1
I was very wrong though. ! Everything was done brilliantly. They seemed perfect for each other.,1
"Overall, it's a very well done offering and well worth seeing.",1
"Audience that time was also different. "".",1
Let's make that dittos for the costumes and script. One can guess the outcome.,1

Awesome Movie!,1
"Highly recommended 9 / 10. His date is horrible, and he finds himself intrigued by Minnie Driver.",1
"I must admit that I didn't get around to seeing this movie in the theater. Take time rent this one..... it's well worth the effort! Jim Belushi is an absolute stitch, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real - life force.",1
! I am really thankful to the creators of this film.,1
The casting was perfect in all respects. See it!,1
!,1
What downer!,1
).,1
Thumbs up Bonnie Hunt!,1
The dog lets out a small moan and then Rob cries. I also said that about THE MATRIX and look at what happened there.,1
! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. David Duchovny's grief scene is so flippin real!!! I'm crying just thinking about it.,1
Nuff said there then.,1
"I hope that one day, the creationism - evolution debate won't be an issue.",1
Charles Darwin begins a war with an utterly predictable ending. War with God.,1
"The truth, once it was discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. Was he in some way responsible for her death? This film portrays that barrier supremely well.",1
Boris is promptly sent off to war.,1
He is what he is.,1
"He was said at the time to be going to war against God, and even to have "" killed God "". In my opinion this part was too long, bizarre and drawn out. She is convinced that he will be eternally damned and bring misfortune to their family by rejecting God. Their bond is solid and unbreakable despite tremendous differences of belief. < br / > < br / > The film revolves around Darwin's life with his wife and four children.",1
"For that, he deserves all the credit.",1
"A hard thing to do in my opinion. < br / > < br / > Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. I doubt it is an irony, the movie is too respectful for that. Een more than him at times. < br / > < br / > I give this movie a 9 / 10. The movie talks about evolution, and that's it.",1
Wow!,1
"A bit of a romantic weepie, actually.",1
"I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest, this is a great film. She plays the precocious young girl to a tee.",1
"The world premiere audience at the TIFF was spellbound. Simply put, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. < br / > < br / >rilliant. Equally magnificent is Connelly's work playing the religious wife of a man who, in Huxley's words, "" killed God "".",1
This sitcom was a big crowd puller in the year 1984 - 1985. It was also continued by her son Rajiv Gandhi.,1
I give it 10 / 10.,1
"But that scene will stay with you. < br / > < br / > Go for it. Very daring too, because so close to "" over the top. "" There is no attempt at period detail.",1
I am 35 and he is 17. < br / > < br / > I still like this sitcom. The life of common people. I saw this title again on Shemaroo.,1
The main event. The mother of all TV comedies.,1
"Looking at the plot ; it sounds like two things. < br / > < br / > The first half hour or so is entertaining and features few laughs ; but once the main plot point has been executed ; the movie really picks up. Besides that, no disrespect to the man ; but he's never been the actor with the greatest range. The humour is mostly of the slapstick variety, and anyone who enjoyed Evil Dead II ( which should be anyone who's seen it ), will no doubt enjoy this too.",1
A so called B movie. Makes you think oh my god.,1
Stacy Keach is embedded in his character.,1
"I liked it, anyway.",1
"It is not just pure technique. But it could have happened anytime, anywhere. What more can I say?",1
It's there that William wants to help finance Bulgaria's almost non - existent mass transportation system. Dr. Ivanov has this theory in that two heads are better then one. This causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains in them fighting for control of William's body!,1
; | Way to go Ted! You did the best with what you had.,1
"Thanks Bruce. Who knew that Ted could rap? ( Hey, I'm a dork too. )",1
"Its campy and very funny. I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. If you are fan of Bruce, I highly recommend it. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy.",1
Complete funny. Bruce sees doctor. < br / > < br / > The idea of the movie is simple. Never a point of scary.,1
"Okay, so I love silly movies. It's fun.",1
"I highly recommend this one. He was great! Anyway, loved film.",1
"These are the kinds of movies I loved, and still love growing up. But that is not the point.",1
It truly adds an immediacy to the story. That's when I came across this gem. And the camera - work!,1
Come on guys! and the setting was both near - original and fun! ).,1
< br / > < br / > Hai The King Baby! It Was Great.,1
Bruce Campbell was as amazing as ever. Can't wait till this makes it out to DVD. The movie itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers. I was completely mistaken.,1
This film looks like fun.,1
It's a true classic. ). It's all I can say.,1
"Nobody is meaner. Awesome plot, huh?",1
"The Dresser "" is perhaps the most refined of backstage films.",1
Make sure your copy is unrated.,1
"Of course, seeing a few boom mikes doesn't mean anything, does it?",1
"He was a blue comic, doing blue humor. Yeah... The Slang. James Bond. """,1
The production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects. It works.,1
"But I wasn't enjoying thatin fact, it kind of made me feel dirty. com.",1
I became addicted.,1
"Dolemite is, for me, an object of my deepest affection. < br / > < br / > Number one, there is no other movie like it.",1
What's the man's name? DOLEMITE!,1
Supporting characters wander in and out of the film. The scenes with these characters are all priceless. Who cares ultimately? Why?,1
what an adventure that was.,1
"An entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration. < br / > < br / > Communist Russia shows how involved all were in the war. < br / > < br / > The acting is top - notch throughout, but some deserve singling out.",1
"A man, truly at sea. Instead the emotions here are as profound and turbulent as the seas featured. Quite a major minor character.",1
"Psyche stretched to the breaking point ( and beyond ). You'll note the term "" unproven captain "" in there, too. Equipment breaks. ""? His ship leaks. Don't do it!",1
It is worth the effort to find.,1
"Its furies are boundless, not least of which, her loneliness. From there he would rejoin the race. Find the film and just watch it.",1
"< br / > < br / > Everything could take its toll, especially the sea. This is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts.",1
"He HAD to win. "" < br / > < br / Emotions include anger, sadness, and disbelief. The era : late 1960's.",1
Perhaps.,1
I happened upon this by chance.,1
"The previous year Francis Chichester ( later Sir Francis ; he was knighted for his exploits ) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. As Donald Crowhurst did. ( Think Eddie the Eagle losing endless Olympic ski jump competitions, and the amateur riders who regularly start the Grand National horse race. ) I remember the events of this movie, the ill fated cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968, in the Golden Globe single handed around the world yacht race.",1
It is a portrayal of lost innocence. 10 out of.,1
This is a gem.,1
"! good job, Lionel Barrymore!!!",1
( Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s. ),1
"She really doesn't like the work, but it's a living. < br / > < br / > Overall, the film is interesting and thought - provoking. Give this one a look. Plus, it was well - paced and suited its relatively short run time.",1
"I know, it's pretty funny.... ). She and Owsley marry, but keep it a secret, while she dismisses Cortez, who still holds out hope. This relic from before the days of the Production Code and the Hays Office is good fun, not great but entertaining.",1
Its brilliant. Then there's Crispin Glover.,1
"As murderer John, Roebuck is frighteningly emotionless. < br / > < br / > The film is overall fantastic and daring. Ione Skye is equally sympathetic and likable.",1
River's Edge is more than just the story of a murder. When do these kids get lost? Crispin Glover is his usual whacked - out self.,1
"Again Veronica is among them, forcing her way through a wall of bodies. < br / > < br / > But Man is not a bird.",1
Yeah.,1
It gave me nightmares. You're one of the best! I have seen this movie three times.,1
This is one of the most outstanding films made by American director Tim Hunter.,1
""". He spends the rest of the film being chaffeured around by Layne or Feck. The scenes in Burkewaite's class are excruciating. He gives Feck an internal logic that makes the story work. I finally saw this on video, after years of hearing about it. Dennis Hopper effortlessly steals the movie. """,1
One of the most memorable movies I have ever seen.,1
Every actor did great at..... acting. It was real nice for a change.,1
"Don't get me wrong. Boris, meanwhile, is killed in action.",1
"Samson eventually shows the body to his friends. You may think this is unrealistic, but this is what happened in the real story. Despite all of this, no one goes to the police. She cries and screams while her mother consoles her. However, we do see the reaction of the younger sister.",1
Joshua John Millar is quite good and so is Ione Skye.,1
Make other quirky connections on your own. Some of the characters'backgrounds may be a little too subtle. Mr. Hopper once killed a woman.,1
This is what River's Edge shows. It seems that murder is trivial now. I still have no idea.,1
I think it is creepy and completely weird. I'm not sure whether i like this film or not. Crispin Glover as always gave a great performance as Layne.,1
Funny lines galore. But I have to type something.,1
This movie is a hidden gem!,1
It is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self. AMEN.,1
Every scene is classic. Great job. The acting is real. It's honest.,1
Would things be different?. 9 / 10.,1
Thankfully! Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. The actors are terrific.,1
"9 / 10. They seem empty, hopeless. The story is based on a real event. No one reports the murder.",1
"Crispin Glover is the biggest standout as the slightly insane Layne. The film begins with a murder. Overall, this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth seeing!",1
"It is definitely not peppy 80s teen fare, obviously.",1
One is that it is based on a true story. It has retained it power. Be prepared to feel unsettled at end.,1
Super stuff!,1
"It's too saddening for that. The young cast does a creditable job - even Keanu Reeves, in one of his earliest roles, is better than usual.",1
Fantastic. Should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools.,1
"and placed it into certain parts of the story with some good timing. Dafoe is anything but devilish as Gas, a deceiving garage mechanic.",1
"Driven to betrayal by the unending torment and uncertainty of waiting, Veronika agrees to wed Boris'cousin, Mark ( Aleksandr Shvorin ), a handsome but unworthy youth. < br / > < br / >'The Cranes are Flying'is both an invigorating visual feast and an audacious, humanistic portrayal of war. The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema.",1
"eXistenZ "" is classic Cronenberg.",1
i was blown away. they don't get it's appeal. i adore it and would watch it again. definitely watch this movie.,1
"Mark, Boris'cousin, rapes Veronika who feels obligated to marry him. Superb camera - work and wonderful set pieces by director Kalatozov.",1
It is like a game.,1
And it actually works effectively.,1
But one thing the film has is undeniable originality. All of the usual elements are here. ! We see the film through his perspective.,1
"Jude Law is also good and is very convincing in his character'fear of implantation. David Cronenberg has a talent for this as he does so many things. Ian Ho This film is unbelievable and, whilst highly entertaining, offers so much more than that.",1
"Welcome to Canada! ) The plot? "" In 1999, you're penetrated by a game.",1
"It doesn't ever allow the movie to get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. < br / > < br / > The movie is not only just weird though. Just when you thought you figured things out, another surprise awaits around the corner. The movie is also still made entertaining and has a good fast pace.",1
"< br / > < br / > But what for? For what it's worth, this film causes a reaction in you.",1
"Reminded me, in style, of another great Russian film, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER.",1
"You are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at every level. Also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence. Ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates reality. Existenz means Da - sein : You are there.",1
Or not. ( Looks great in a short black skirt too. ) The last line of the film is superbly ambiguous. So says Ted Pikul in the film.,1
"eXistenZ is a virtual realty simulation of man's existence. For Baudrillard, `.",1
This film is cool. I don't know.,1
"Try not to read too much about the plot, or it'll be ruined for you. < br / > < br / > The acting gets two thumbs up as well. It's best to see eXistenZ with a clear mind.",1
"As Allegra comments about the real world, "" there's nothing going on here. "" Seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves another viewing.",1
I advice all of you not to miss this movie...,1
"< br / > < br / > It's NOT a waste of your time, go and watch it! That'exactly how it goes! Most of them even if not all.",1
It has original scenario.,1
That makes it all the more remarkable.,1
This is one of my three all - time favorite movies.,1
"It has a nice plot and some young, bright actors in it. This time it seems they had what they needed and used them well.",1
in some typically humdrum California small town.,1
"I started to watch this show by accident, but I love it.",1
< br / > < br / > Mr. Razbin!,1
"She watched her Dad leave her motherless. She struggles to deal with life, her demons, and her fears.",1
The animation was superb. I love the character progression. WOW! < br / > < br / > This episode was FREAKING AWESOME!,1
Check it out and you'll be amazed.,1
"I had long wanted to watch this romantic drama ( with a WWII setting ) and, now that I have, all I can say is that it's a veritable masterpiece of Russian cinema! < br / > < br / > Disappointingly, the ).",1
He likes hanging around with Bob. I loved Heather too. Owen is jealous of Alicia. What happened next?,1
"She says no. """,1
"Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of Rock'n Roll! When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day. The music is fantastic and the concerts are directed brilliantly! Whilst the'Wedding Singer'was portraying the pop side of the 80's,'Rock Star'is all about metal.",1
"Well, I strongly recommend this anyway! ).",1
"Like a diamond, this movie shines. There'some laughs thrown in too.",1
Oh yes.,1
!,1
"But, I digress.",1
I thought what an average movie. I seen this movie when it came out.,1
"Well, almost. Worth seeing - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. Fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack.",1
"That is one of the film's strengths, the concert footage. It is also the reason why I loved this movie so. < br / > < br / > But it isn't a great movie. It was a great time for metal heads. None. It also gets a 10 of 10 for pure entertainment. What to say about a movie like Rock Star?",1
"However, Veronika does not forget Boris, and keeps waiting for him.",1
"That could have been worked on a bit better, but not a major biggie. I've only seen it recently and completely fell in love with it!",1
Definitely worth checking out.,1
Its all about being a rockstar. The acting was great by Mark Wahlberg.,1
"Again, not big deal. The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable. ).",1
"Wahlberg's "" Izzy "" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true. < br / > < br / > Naturally, ROCK STAR is filled with great music.",1
It's the Steel Dragon band. He then receives a phone call.,1
This movie is great!,1
This is one of the best action films I have seen.,1
"It is sublime and beautifully filmed. I walked the same streets, squares, and bridges over the Moskva River.",1
Is Geena hot or what? Elsewhere TV image.,1
"Well, give her a chance, because Davis does deliver a performance above par. Overall : if one hasn't seen this one yet, don't forget to rent it for the next quiet Saturday night! and on the plot ( from Shane Black, the writer of "" Lethal Weapon "" and "" The Last Boy Scout "".",1
I love this film...! ! It's halarious!!!,1
"Don't miss it! Geena Davies is great, Samual L Jackson is even greater.",1
"In no way do I seek to minimize the loss. Sure, there are better movies. wouldn't you agree? 99. "" What a funny screenplay!",1
This is movie is actually one of my all time favorites.,1
2. Some things are unrealistic. The Action : This is a very action packed movie.,1
You won't disappointed.,1
Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this film! The mother / schoolteacher with the quiet family life? Or a combination of both?,1
"Here, that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive. The violence is bloody. A bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd. There is a serious scene in this movie. I call it honesty.",1
! The cast in this film crackles. It packs so many thrills and its so funny.,1
I'm one of those girls who will NEVER BE A VICTIM......................,1
"Watch it, you won't be sorry. SO worth your time. Craig is also irresistible as Timothy, the sexy bad guy with no conscience.",1
"< br / > < br / > The basic plot? Thin, to be truthful. As her memory returns, so do the people who want the assassin dead.",1
7,1
He does a great job of playing the unwitting sidekick to Geena Davis'tough character. Watch it.,1
< br / > < br / > I love the film.,1
It may have failed simply because of its title. That was a compliment.,1
"Violent, but not gory.",1
"In TLKG, Jackson is the everyman we identify with. ( She's even funnier that Charly. ) Never a dull moment.",1
"What more can be said? If anything, he looks drastically younger than 40.",1
"You believe he IS Hamlet. If you don't like Shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version.",1
"Olivier seemed far too old, not only in his looks but in his acting of the part. Yes, it is splendid, but I feel it needs an actor you can emphathise with to play Hamlet and this for me is Jacobi. What a revelation this play now is for me! Something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off. Well, I struggled with it. Amazing. I'm interested to discover Jacobi has trained Branagh as yes, you can certainly see the influence.",1
I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.,1
Hamlet OVERREACHES himself in classic tragic form. WHY? He wants it ALL! His own HUBRIS is his undoing.,1
Jacobi's rendition attracted me to a deeper knowledge. It's the only Hamlet that I'd invest in... It gets very high rating from viewers.,1
"But, oddly enough, I never noticed the time. Here it is presented in its entirety, a rarity on film. And it works. Together the cast present a seamless ensemble. This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is by far the best that I have seen.",1
"I've seen various Hamlets, and I've taught the play.",1
This film is a displaced gem and well - worth purchasing. 10 / 10.,1
But these are minor flaws in an otherwise enjoyable and well - made movie.,1
So what happens here?,1
beautifully. That makes sense.,1
"The acting truly elevates it. Scott throws himself at Emerson, and she's dazzled.",1
"This film was full of suspense and was well directed, the black and white effect made it a great mystery.",1
"the second half, moved me to tears. it is a comedic yet serious part of the journey. a beautiful film directed fantastically. in the end only 2 of the 9 escapees are left.",1
"punishment for their "" crimes "". They decide to stay together travelling with their red van across Japan.",1
A great film. will society accept them?,1

This film was full of excellent acting from top to bottom. What soon follows is not surprising.,1
"I would have just watched the film, but they always put on weeknights around midnight. Finally! They think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills. Third time lucky.",1
< br / > < br / > I highly recommend this film. I loved every second of it. Now.,1
All of the actors give great performances. Each has their own dreams.,1
< br / > < br / > Daimajin is a perfect example of why Japanese cinema is so glorious.,1
"There are several disturbing scenes in film. < br / > < br / > So, be careful with your samurai sword. You wouldn't want to rattle Daimajin's cages. Therefore, it is not the casual sci - fi film.",1
"< br / > < br / > Now I haven't seen it since then... but it never left me. Worth catching - - but not if it's dubbed print. They paired it with the first sequel "" Return of the Ginat Majin "". Like another poster mentioned Ch. It's just about a village ruled over by an evil man. Technically it isn't horror... until the statue comes to life at the end.",1
"Highly recommended. Fujio Morita'sharp, moody cinematography likewise hits the bull's eye.",1

"Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again. Don't pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry. And don't count the awful Mr. Magoo reworked for live action. Oh, well. That was strictly a one - joke moment but they had to use it in all six episodes. He probably made a lot of money, though.",1
"Much of the longer version seems to be on screen simply because it looked good. Whether it was ever done or still exists is up in the air, but it would be interesting to see. There are times when things go on and on and on and nothing happens.",1
What a spectacle that would be!,1
"< br / > < br / > By nature, a film editor, I am deeply frustrated by two problems with this film. There are always many film - goers who dislike long, weighty pictures. A lot of folks don't react all that favorably to this approach. These factors doubtless contributed to the box - office failure of "" Heaven's Gate "".",1
There was still a massive preoccupation with creating the reality and atmosphere to the detriment of a good script. I was mesmerised by the breadth and the sheer beauty of so much of the photography.,1
"But by 1980, in the wake of the Reagan Revolution, it was thought of as nearly un - American.",1

Highly recommended. Ten out of ten. They must have made the film at about the time I saw the show. All of this reminded me of how terrific film is. What a talent!,1

I was very moved by a few scenes. It could be set in any town in the UK. < br / > < br / > Overall this film IS a must see.,1
8 for her amazing achievement.,1
? Is that not what films are supposed to be about!,1
Its IMDB rating of 1.,1
But the ending theme song was a plus. I totally recommend it. but it is basically the same as the first movie.,1
And it does! All the characters you want are here! 5 / 5!,1
"I liked this movie, the second Naruto feature film. Of course, all is not as it seems and there are plenty of fights to go around. The story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants.",1
< br / > < br / > The story was fun. I think that's where this movie fails.,1
"Just watch Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her. Otto Kruger, Eve Arden, and Edward Brophy give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles.",1
"And Molly, of course is Mabel. It is said that he had some input on his scenes as well. What is special about this film, though, is recreating silent movies in 1939. The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch. Lots of DVD extras as well in this restored version released in 2008.",1
"However, "" Hollywood Cavalcade "" is still quite watchable. He's so shocked, he dumps her. He becomes extremely successful with her as his star. Fortune smiled on him even at the end.",1
"He'll be okay as long as he still has his friends. After inventing pie throwing and the keystone cops, his dream comes true. It's 1913. Upon returning, the film takes a dramatic turn.",1
I have always liked it.,1
But do! It looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film!,1
It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was.,1
Black Day Blue Night was actually good modern noir.,1

I thought it was just another kung fu movie.,1
"Highly recommended. There are no surprises, but everybody does their thing well. Clearly, this film meant a lot to him.",1
It's a great finish to the series. This is a film that has to be taken in context.,1

"Part of me felt cheated, part of me confused, but mostly I was just laughing. A lot of the film is quite boring though, the best scenes bookend film while the rest is far too slow.",1
"It's quite a slow, thoughtful film that meanders along and doesn't try to force anything down the viewer's throat. Miike's explanation of the connection is very funny though, and caps series off quite nicely. There's also a HK stunt crew on hand for the films action sequences, which are very cool in a HK - via - Miike style.",1
< br / > < br / > The men in the story are also well cast.,1
"Of course there is the music and the dancing. Don't miss this one, great entertainment.",1
i liked the story. good job.,1
Looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands. Loch Ness Monster is a considerable improvement. However if you can immune yourself to it you'll be alright. There are plenty of laughs.,1
i think the supporting actress did a great job in her role. it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end. cool flick.,1

What dancing and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly.,1
I would recommend you seeing it. It was entertainment. The ending took a wonderful twist.,1
The supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters. Great job!,1

He would give the role the depth it requires. Jiminey Christmas! HAHAHAHAHAHA funny huh? Meanwhile where is Ralphy?? I was thinking perhaps Dennis Franz. She won a freakin Oscar. Its too Pat Marita is no longer. This is the Karate Kid for you!,1
It is a great family movie. ! Miyagi was great as in the previous 3!,1

"My vote is nine. The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway, whose owner proposes her.",1
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.,1
"You can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her. Also, one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks. OK, so this is a complete rip off of the first Karate Kid. < br / > < br / > So maybe this isn't a perfect movie.",1
And there was no tournament to compete in. Both Daniel and Julie favored karate. That was very funny!,1
We can all learn a thing or two from Myiagi's witticisms! Never mind!,1
none of the fighting is graphic. the ending is also good and a bit surprising. 8 / 10 Naturally she is trained how to fight.,1
"I mean, come on! Thank you Zamfi!",1
"Great movie, truly impressed. She has such a scene presence and is a very good actress. He should have supported his girlfriend! One thing I didn't like was Gene Kelly's character.",1
"All in all, I enjoyed it. The Zen monastery is both austere and charming. The plot twists are believable and predictable.",1
But nothing like this showed up in movie. WTF?,1
Actress Sandy Dennis is perfect as the Dr. Jekyll and Miss. But for reasons of her own deep insecurity she keeps them at arms length.,1
This film requires a lot of patience. < br / > < br / > I praise Robert Altman.,1
You won't forget it soon.,1

"I mean, it is a children's cartoon.",1
charlie's performance is magnificent.,1

Hard living and hard working. It was sadly missed.,1

Not the manner in which they served. This movie was well done. They need acceptance and understanding to overcome that. The offender was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in Leavenworth.,1
"But after dinner, there can be no neutrality. Also starring Corin Nemec and Carla Gugino.",1
So I sat and watched it and boy was I blown away. I actually ran across this movie by accident. The acting is absolutely superb.,1
They supplied a score that is full of charm and characterization. This has got to be one of the better post - Astaire musicals made by Columbia.,1
< br / > < br >,1
Wow!,1
High recommended A truly moving film. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the entire movie. And the family does not know how to handle the problem. This is a little - seen anti - war film that has been ignored for too long. The time is Thanksgiving of 1972. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas.,1
"She and her son, who just recently returned from Vietnam collide in some very tense issues.",1
It has to be seen to be appreciated.,1
This movie is powerful.,1
"An under - appreciated, unseen gem. And to any Vietnam war buff.",1
The acting here is TOP NOTCH! < br / > < br / > The visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth.,1
"Danny wants her to have her success, but at the same time realizes he's lost her. Phil Silvers is very amiable and funny as the in - house comic and best friend. They all hate oysters, but they're looking for a pearl. When they find one, all three of them will have good luck, they believe. She is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life.",1
< br / > < br / > But those are minor complaints. I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I had not heard of it before. I rate it 8 out of difficult 10.,1

I want the DVD!,1
"Kathy Bates is the overbearing mom, and does a great job. < br / > < br / > The film is realistic, as we see Emilio home from Vietnam, during Thanksgiving. But it was not ; it was so much more!.",1

"It was a very strong, deeply moving film. < br / > < br / > The only fault I had with this was its realism. And that'coming from an Anarchist.",1
"Totally impressing. I saw it a short while ago. Both actually. I found a masterpiece. It is even to buy on DVD, with additional stuff. Was it a movie, a documentary? Punishment Park is for those who want to grow.",1
What if that had happened?,1
"At least it appears to have that history to it now, maybe not as much when it was ( barely ) released.",1
Such artistry. It stinks. 'Poor Tom'is a huge downer. But that's only my opinion.,1
"Cut! "" Secondly, the actors hired by Watkins were purposefully chosen to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds.",1
"The group on trial includes a feminist, a black panther and a folk singer. Many of the actors are amateurs improvising with broad characters. It has been claimed that the film is reactionary and unequivoc They must accomplish this without food or water.",1
You won't feel happy. And succeeds.,1
"Today, this film still retains its power.",1
And that's merely the most obvious example.,1
"This movie is a raw, concentrated distillation of America's PRESENT political scene. I grew up hating hippies and in some respects I still do. At times I find myself believing that the USA could easily slip into fascism. I can feel what they must have felt. Certain aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect, specifically some of the acting.",1

You wont regret it! Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.,1
Enjoy,1
"It seems very, very real. All the facts are explained, the interviewers ask questions and film everything. Is this true? If it would be filmed anyway. The defendants are people from all social classes. They are no heroes.",1
"It really makes you think. Had it been more widely seen, would it have changed anything? The acting is totally convincing. To think this film was made the year I was born.",1
"The situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations, however. It reminded me of a sort of realistic version of Battle Royale ( 2000 ).",1
"The cast has first - rate material to work with in Watkins'screenplay. < br / > < br / > Now consider Punishment Park. Today we tend to take celebrity endorsements for granted, giving little thought to its more alarming implications.",1
"Both of them and Toki die along the way. The series is also divided into four parts. Hokuto - Big Dipper, Nanto - Gemini. There is only one successor each generation. Which is funny and badass, but makes for quick fights.",1
"Romance is in the air, love lurking everywhere.",1
< br / > < br / > The cast is nice.,1
"But, I liked it.",1
"There is an air of desperation about both these men. The same goes for Mr T. Courtenay. Sitting at the mirror, his eyes reflect the King's madness.",1
So well done.,1
"I thoroughly enjoyed myself and must admit that I thought that this film was one of the most overlooked gems of last year. The trailers I saw were not appealing, the cast did not look that interesting and I had no idea what the plot would be about. In the end I found it to be an interesting meditation on relationships and family.",1
Will she choose the right person? The conflict lies in Helen's indecision.,1
"Will tangled affairs like these ever straighten themselves out? And, on and on the letter goes. The town's museum curator, too, may have a secret love.",1
The story is great.,1
"< br / > < br / > Secondly, the film seems to lose its way in terms of plot in the second half. However, it's still good and if you get the chance, it's definitely worth seeing. It just misses being both a light romantic comedy and being a clever portrait of life.",1
The acting part is very strong.,1
"They are a delight to watch. Frankly, I am surprised that the film is not better known.",1
"You'll see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. < br / > < br / > However, there are two serious complications.",1

A $ 4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about.,1

I mean everything was dead - on great and very accurate for that matter. !,1
"Lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. The next day, Lazarus ( Samuel L. Jackson ) finds Rae and carries her home. Rae only wanted to have sex all the time whereas a wife may not. The film has a different feel to it.",1
Samuel L. Jackson has also a fantastic performance in the role of Lazarus. My vote is eight.,1
"He plays his guitar and sings to her. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. < br / > < br / > Brewer shows us the region he grew up in. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. This is in the subtext and not the main plot of the story.",1

"It was well - edited, well shot, and well - mixed... everything was great. However, there was one weak link in the chain : Justin Timberlake. Loved it. The accents and the dialogue were carried off flawlessly.",1
"No one is perfect and if everyone would realize that, then we'd be a lot better off. You'd think with the role of a sex - crazed woman, overacting would be a given, but no, not here. Not exactly looking for what I just described you say? < br / > < br / > One thing not up for debate is how great Jackson and Ricci both are here.

"Literally. "" It's like a crime dramedy.",1
"Though the voice is slurred, the diction is somehow clear and easy to understand. The twist here is that Assy is literally a walking buttocks. < br / > < br / > If you have access to the Adult Swim comedies, Assy McGee is certainly worth the watching. The sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme. Each episode clocks in at a mere 8 - 9 minutes, so you really have little to lose.",1
"To which title character snaps off the one - liner : "" I'm going... to shoot you. "" Think it's brainless, infantile poop humor? Assy McGee is a show that you really have to be a certain age to appreciate. Go watch the Stallone film'Cobra'and you'll see what I mean.",1

this episode was sad. Prue was the strongset of all of them. Shax blows in and blasts Prue and Piper. For Now.,1
"They become national sensation with a crowd in front of their house. The source proposes Phoebe to stay with him and in return he would save her sister. My vote is nine. Prue and Piper bring Dr. Griffiths to their home to save him from the Sauce's assassin Shax. < br / > < br / > "" All Hell Breaks Loose "" is a good but incoherent episode.",1
This is what happened. Phoebes calls Leo to heal Piper and Prue. So Leo heals them. Meanwhile Phoebe is in the Underworld.,1
"A mix of mystery, suspense, and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of Vertigo. The plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility.",1
"I've tried e - bay, Amazon. The acting is superb.",1

HAL is curious to see those sketches and brings up his doubtful question about the purpose of the Jupiter mission. His conscious makes him capable to try to save his life from termination. HAL begs him to stop HAL uses his final apologetic techniques to convince Dave of not disconnecting him. His style of movie making is still fresh and intact.

"But, SURPRISE! There was no cartoon, no coming attractions. The ride had just begun.",1

But KOQs comes real close.,1
"She is, essentially, an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and is certainly no man - hater. I'm surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this t. v. movie... as far as I'm aware, the series itself, has had a huge following, reviewer pundits and real people alike, have praised it to a person. As is my fervent hope.",1
"She is one tough cookie! So, I'm not sure it had the quality of writers that Seinfeld or Raymond had. But we still watch it almost daily on TBS.",1
"It had a good run. Amiable Doug is a good match. See also, Becker.",1

It hits the mark 99 % of the time.,1
You will not be disappointed.,1
"The King of Queens "" could be divided into two eras.",1

Thanks for great show.. Thank you AA. I rate it one of the best ever.,1
Nearly every teenager ( and adults ) watch this sitcom. !,1
"And of course, Jerry Stiller is brilliant as Arthur. Critics of this show obviously don't get it - - or haven't watched the show "". And the yelling - - the best episode is when they show him as a kid yelling "" Lemon Icee!!",1

"As the years have passed ( almost 25 to be exact ) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. He seems to have regretted making this film, and that may very well be why it is unavailable in any form.",1
I hope you enjoy it.,1

You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. My choice for playing Karen is Hilary Swank.,1
"Richard's struggle with drugs, and Karen's brief marriage. There are some other moments in the movie as well. Cynthia Gibb was great at portraying Karen, and Mitchell Anderson was okay as Richard. After I first saw it, I thought it was wonderful. ! I would not believe that it was her decision. God bless you, Karen!",1
The film could have touched so much more on that.,1
"It's some of Karen's best work. If you buy it, you will wonder why they waited. Nicely done!",1

Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey?,1
It was Taylor all the time. ?,1
Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. In all her world comes down upon her. He takes her to a place in Kolkata which supposedly looks like her husband'home. and he does.,1
At least The Harding family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford. It's basically the exact same film as the original ; obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80's to the nth degree.,1
"Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali, Mithi's ( Konkona Sen's ) elder sister. ! Konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. yeah maybe better than Mr and Mrs Iyer.",1
It is almost like an intense religious belief. The open ending reflects this reality. Ultimately what is reality? There appear to be some loose ends.,1

"Hats off to her, for this great movie!! The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient ( Mithi ). !",1

I must say it was a let down. Also there seemed no central theme to the movie.,1
"in a simple word "" a wonderful experience.",1
"rather its intention is loud and clear. and society labels her as'' schizophrenic''. meethi bravely, madly, sincerely does that.",1
Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie.,1
"I absolutely loved the way Aparna Sen wove these commentaries into the story. < br / > < br / > - The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for "" maya "". Konkona Sensharma beautifully conveys that the world Mithi is living in is as real to her as ours is to us.",1

I'm emailing them now.,1
i love this movie. where did all the good movies go? i want them back.,1

Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. What ever happened to Disney? I never forgot this movie.,1
! Now if only Disney would show it just ONE more time!,1
"Grabbing butts / physical domination isn't going to make it right. < br / > < br / > The movie was enjoyable. Furthermore it is very stereotyped. ? No means no. How often have we seen scenes where the woman says "" no "" but obviously doesn't mean it?",1
We're all here on an exchange program.,1
The rest of the cast also play well.,1
No way!,1
But that's just me.,1
It was so realistic and funny. I give it 9 out 10.,1
My favorite film this year.,1

"Another is a Gambian - Spanish or rather Gambian - Catalan male who appears a bit invented. Klapisch ( the director ) went to the New York Film School from 1982 - 85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience. The German character features a few more tried and tested stereotypes. The Erasmus program encompasses some 30 countries from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of which are not EU members.",1
Pas du tout! Nothing positive.,1
"I highly recommend this film. The English guy was the perfect "" geezer "" stereotype.",1

And it is not strange. A year is a very long time. They are full of unusual ideas for life. They like jokes. Our French guy will also get there.,1
"If you haven't seen it, do so. The Spanish landlord is also 100 % accurate. He finally succeeds, and Wendy probably has the night of her life.",1
"Now, where to find the second example? It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. Xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities, his faults. He left this point low - key. The message that the author wanted to transmit isn't difficult to guess.",1
"L'Auberge Espagnole "" is one of those movies viewer becomes sad when it ends. My vote is eight.",1

I liked the movie. Even the soundtrack will do. com but its not there.,1
< br / > < br / > I definitely recommend it....,1
Surprisingly good made for T. V. Thriller. But that's just the typical Hollywood scene that provokes more trouble. The direction is also very good.,1
"Hahahahahaha... that's funny. And is right to give this movie a ` 10'rating? So many of them have the same feel to them. Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous.",1
"At first, she is blinded by his assurances that he is innocent and her love for him, but as time passes she continues to be suspicious of him. < br / > < br / > If you get a chance to give this one a look, please do so.",1

"I have the "" Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding "" DVD. Your software should already know that! ) ( Hey!",1
"I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. Though Gary Rat wasn't bad, the best of the three was easily Stripperella. I was a little let down.",1
A brilliant idea by the script writers.,1
"Does our society teach this? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? How is a "" typical "" human alike or different than Rose?",1
The ending was bad as well. SHE is FINE lol. I wish i could give an example but i cant recall any - exactly as it was said.,1
"I would highly recommend this one. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work.",1
I am very proud of the film. I shot this movie.,1
I am better person for Heartbeeps.,1

"I'm a scout for the Army. Things was fine for a while. Only the Valiant "" qualifies as a gritty good western. But them'Paches is pretty smart.",1
"A pity! The character he plays here is driven and, when necessary, ruthless.",1

"< br / > < br / > A sleeper of a film, and a good solid western for fans of this genre. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive.",1
My Grade : 10 / 10.,1
"It was funny, but it also had many touching moments.",1
"I. ','Hark At Barker'and the'Doctor'series. It was'custard pie in the face'stuff really. S'('Secret Intelligence Service').",1

"Enough! It is like her mind is in ` another world.'Ok! 'Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. I will wipe off my mouth with soap and not mention any more soap names. However, the only problem is that Betty thinks this is all real.",1
"I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. And, lastly, there is Crispin Glover. Chris Rock's performance seems rather wooden, but he has his moments.",1
"The reference to "" The Wizard of Oz "" is obvious. What is the film all about? The plot is very simple. And here comes the big question. It seems not to affect her at all.",1
"< br / > < br / > 7 out of 10 She exudes goodness, warmth, and is irresistible.",1
"! By comparison, Porridge, Open All Hours and that awful series'Lucky Man'did not come close.",1
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through.,1
"The entire cast is strong, if not spectacular. ?",1
"The ending is believable and poignant. And it's the writer's responsibility, John C. Richards. Somebody went out on a limb.",1
"Alternately funny and touching, this movie is almost perfect. Stop reading commentaries and go see it.",1
"Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) lives her life through soap Opera "" A Reason to Love "" as a way to escape her slob husband and dull life. We almost believe what she is saying, yet we understand that her mind is fractured. Even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of Betty's ramblings, the music swells as she speaks, giving us, the audience, Betty's emotional perspective. She pours her heart out to him and he plays along, thinking she's auditioning for a part on the show. An example of this would be Betty'first meeting with her crush.",1
"By clearly defining the protagonist's difficult life, Nurse Betty justifies its character's tendency to turn away from reality.",1
"Just to let you in on the movie, she plays Betty. I can see why, she is an incredible actress. But I'm glad I did. "" She just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and her belong together.",1
This has to be one of best cast films in recent years.,1
Certainly he is the one to teach people this art.,1
In real life she is an ordinary housewife who works at a diner. 5 / 10. Nurse Betty is really an interesting movie.,1
"In Betty, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she's chasing thinks her genuine adoration is nothing more than a joke.",1
It shows Jacob Goodnight as someone who is human.,1
! They really drive it home and go for gratuitous violence just cause. He does a good job and the man is legitimately enormous!!,1
That's all. Now where I really throw in a spoiler for a second warning.,1
Most of the teens are deservingly killable too so that works well. 7 out of 10.,1
"I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. This movie was so cool! Just don't watch it in a hotel. When we saw this, we groaned.",1
"Good, creepy, B - movie slasher fare. Lots of fun.",1
Definitely a horror movie lover must see.,1
I loved it!,1
Most of them die except for 3 of them.,1
Rating 2. Yeah right!,1
And no CGI crap.,1
See No Evil is the first film from WWE films. and a handful of adults.,1
Why?? The film is actually pretty good.,1
"Think of this movie as a modern day latter Friday the 13th film. He sold the role really well, and really did look menacing. And stick around after credits too... So the WWE has done it. It just seemed to cliché and looked like nothing new.",1
"), there's some good shots here. But that's not what slasher films are about.",1
Watch and enjoy! The female cast members are all great and fun to watch.,1
"< br / > < br / > But all in all, this is a very worthy adaptation. ( Also, as far as I recall, Basil should have been killed seated at the table. ) Particularly Dorian's encounter with Sybil's brother suffers from the obvious studio look. He seems to equally wreak havoc on both sexes here, as he should according to the novel. I'm sure Wilde would have liked it.",1
"Both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil, with evil winning in the end. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film.",1
My only other qualm is with hair styles. The acting however is brilliant.,1
This is not the fault of the boys however. The quality is lacking in audio department.,1
"I guarantee it. It's incredible! Go watch "" Rush in Rio "" for yourself.",1
! Lets just hope and pray that they don't retire anytime soon!,1
I think she graduated. < br / > < br / > I understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this.,1
! Rush in Rio is simply an amazing DVD. This is a real live concert DVD.,1
All they do is entertain! < br / > < br / > I give this DVD 100 out of 100.,1
We have rather firmly stood by them for years.,1
This DVD is worth it!,1
"More power to them! I won't list the songs, in case you want to be surprised. This slick two - disc set shows Rush at their finest. The video editing is terrible in my opinion.",1
How do these guys keep going?,1
"Yes, I am aware of its flaws! Personally, I regard "" The Egyptian "" in an extremely favourable light.",1
There were moments that made my hairs stand up!,1
Watch this film and enjoy! - and they all deserved the award!,1
"However, the principal acting is a bit weak.",1
I have Lasser Disc version. Soon i Hope will appeared.,1
"The main character, however, is not Akhnaton but rather the fictitious Sinuhe. Sinuhe is appointed Court physician, but becomes obsessed with the Babylonian courtesan Nefer. As a baby, Sinuhe is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the river Nile and adopted by the physician Senmut and his wife.",1
The acting was good for a 1954 film. What does that say about us? I don't know why they don't show it more often. That is why I ended up watching it.,1
"Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel, it doesn't cheapen it!",1
This Fox spectacle was a big hit when released in 1954. Check it out.,1
< br / > < br / > What I like most about'Apocalypse Now'is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. It is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated.,1
He is street wise and cunning a survivor. Her correct name. Did his monotheism influence the Jewish people? Performances as follows.,1
"Fox, are you listening?",1
I'd say that a full 3 / 4s of the film is great. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. He does have the perfect voice for the character. It does nothing except explain his exile. Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is sadly miscast. Now for the bad.,1
"Yes, that too, but so was Shakespeare. Tedious? ... as valuable as King Tut's tomb! Historically inaccurate?",1
This is not what one would term a happy tale.,1
"Does he? And what a story it is! I recommend it. Sinhue and Horemheb grow up. Stay tuned ). Yeah, right... still, she wasn't that bad _ I've seen worse.",1
BRAIN SURGERY! Everything old is olde again. IRON! ) and its gorgeous cinematography and score.,1
"The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time ( 1955 ). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. I wait in great anticipation of such a film, there are already numerous books on the subject. In real life Nefer ( Nefertitti ) was the wife of Akhenaton. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion.",1

I can't picture anyone better for the role. This is a classic war movie.,1

The judging is so over the top with it's criticism. No.,1
I was entertained 99. 9 percent of the time watching it.,1
"Having dabbled in the modeling industry ( as a model ), I watch this show with a slightly different view than most might. Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but apparently neither does ANTM. Though, I must add, ANTM may become tad tiring and dull, after watching several cycles, as it has become for me. I think not.",1
"All of this slides smoothly with just the right beat. Well, at least, that's what I tell my friends. Because my girlfriend watches it, of course. It will make crave for more, somehow. There are no lenghts. Yes, I watch this show.",1
"It's as if they were competing with "" Fear Factor "".",1
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense.,1

"Her top henchman is played by Douglas Kennedy, and it was no surprise to see Lane Bradford as one of the baddies. < br / > < br / > Aside from that, you have a fairly traditional Western adventure. Somehow however, this film got by me until I had a chance to catch it today courtesy of my local library. Interestingly, the leader of the bad guys is an already wealthy woman, disarmingly portrayed by Noreen Nash.",1
Racial intolerance figures as the primary theme in the Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald screenplay.,1

I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick.,1
All of these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle.,1

The music is beautiful. It was unforgettable.,1
"I was expecting a "" classic "" film, with lots of war.",1
"In this film, he does a great job! Predictable in some parts sure, but never boring.",1
The Nelsons ( Kay Francis and John Eldredge ) are forcibly employed by Gurney ( Bogart ) without objections. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into.,1
This is a good short film showing Bogart on his rise to stardom. His other gang members also function more as stooges than hoodlums.,1

< br / > < br / > The Cell is more of a visceral experience than a film.,1
But for those who like to be freaked out..... I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. In that respect it is a fairly large step above ` A Clockwork Orange. It won't be half as good on tape. ENJOY!,1
"But, of course, it is likely that there are much more different cuts. 110 minutes ).",1
"I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable.",1
Vincent D'onofrio played amazingly well.,1

During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things. "" I think it's one of the year's most engrossing films.",1

Nevertheless this was a watchable if somewhat disturbing film. I had to shut it off from time to time and come back to it later.,1
"A serial killer, Carl Stargher, has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them drown in a water filled cell.",1
I would recommend for a scary thriller.,1
But it is without a doubt Vincent D'Onofrio that has the biggest impression here. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. < br / > < br / > The casting is top notch also.,1
To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point.,1
"Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals. Style over substance. And Vince Vaughn? The Cell "" is the internal version of most serial killer movies.",1
"Yes, it's real eye candy to watch all. It suited the movie well and gave some of the scene's some extra mood and atmosphere. Still I felt that Vince Vaughn was also miscast in this movie. < br / > < br / > "" The Cell "" is beautifully looking with impressive sets, costumes and make - up. < br / > < br / > The story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn't always make sense.",1
"When his next mission is given to him, he is baffled. "" Willard does not go alone however. Kurtz, on the other hand wants to die. I decided I need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film.",1
"In fact, it is basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Lambs. In that movie, you didn't see insanity, you were THERE. None that have ever been made even come close to it. The Cell is an incredibly well - made film, and it deserves to be recognized.",1
"Carl just went into coma ; he has been sick for a long time. 2. Every room in the imagi This is dangerous for a lot of reasons. In fact, the story is pretty good.",1
It was memorable and so welloignant. < br / > < br / > The ending will just tug at your heart. Madge Sinclair is the principal who loves her babies. I guess that answers my question.,1
"Those were that Pat Conroy was both an outsider and he was white ; with almost the entire population of this off - shore cay was black and very poor. ( Can't anything, that is ). "" < br / > < br / > BUT don't you tell a'Young Turk ', such as Pat Conroy, that he can't.",1
!,1
Oh... one last bit of advice.,1
"he didn't overplay role, and I found him to be totally believable. Voight is Conrack.",1
"Charlie Don't Surf "".",1
2. Education is about more than reading and writing.,1
"""..... "" So, It's a funny movie. God forbid. Together?",1
Or does it? A great film with a heart - breaking ending.,1
"He proceeds to enlight them about all these factors. Either way, the movie's a real gem.",1
Who would they have chosen?,1
"The loss of civilization, the loss of judgement, of self. And a progression - or retreat?",1
!,1
"Well - worth restoring and reviving on cable - TV, VHS or DVD. You'll discover who the killer is just as William Marshall does.",1
Truly a wonderful film. Just thought you would like to know.,1
"Escapade "" has got over the years has come from the horror stories Stan Laurel told of its production. Utopia, "" a. k. a. "" Not since Bette Davis's 1933 vehicle "" Ex - Lady "" have I seen a film that was so much better than its star said it was!",1
"Or is it because of the lack of Laurel & Hardy regulars? A shame, because they are still the ones that really carry and make the movie. Or because it's not made by the Hal Roach studios or 20th Century Fox? The movie is not halve as bad as people want to make you believe it is. He was well over 60 years old already. Both of them retired from movies after completing this one.",1
Our heros are left on their own desert island. It's such a metaphor for the real life truth. I particularly enjoyed the bedtime scene.,1
"The film was made, on locations in Spain, in 1949. Also realizing the most from her role, Patricia Roc.",1
I saw it again on video recently.,1
"is not so much seen as experienced. < br / > < br / > The movie is rather episodic. The "" Apocalypse Now! """,1
So go see it!,1
!,1
"You have Cary Elwes who's charming and talented, but he can't do comedy.",1
Apocalypse Now does this perfectly. Colonel Kilgore. But what will he decide to do once he finds him?,1
What makes this movie special you say? That is a timeless scene.,1
It's just non - stop laughing. I first saw Robin Hood : Men in Tights back in 1994 in the cinema.,1
"Some of them don't work, but most do, and well. That's a given. You know what it is when you're getting into it.",1
Watch it!!,1
Might contain spoilers.,1
"Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. I Love this movie!",1
But Willard both gains and loses. Spoilers. The horror spoken of is the reality of war. This film is wholly different from ` The Godfather.,1
!,1
Some moments really made me crack up so hard! lol ) and everyone else!,1
"I knew at the time I wasn't seeing great art, but just a campy, goofy, though always laugh - worthy take on Robin Hood and / or adventure movies.",1
Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. as well.,1
"It's funny from start to finish, none of the comedy is overdone or boring. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat.",1
That's the basics! This Robin vows to do! I remember when I first saw this movie.,1
I give this movie an 8 / 10.,1
It is a visual feast of North African ( mostly Saharan ) imagery that is timeless. That this film was influential in the Quatsi films of Godfrey Reggio is an understatement. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty - five years ago.,1
How unfair is that? I never fail to appreciate his work in this movie. It goes on and on with strange scenes.,1
"A lecture on philosophical views on creationism, the mythos surrounding humanities existence, the before and after, that was has been, the what is and the what will be. I only hope I can convey it effectively enough. < br / > < br / > Fata Morgana is a film dealing with the existence of man on our Earth.",1
"It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. I think each side ends up complimenting the other, and it's something that still * seems * like it shouldn't work. Or, maybe it isn't : Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke.",1
These are also known as mirages. I love seeing films that are just in classes of their own.,1
The effect left me to conclude : things are not as they seem. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work.,1
It's not a documentary either. It will change the way you view films. A must see.,1
Take a gamble?,1
"There are no human characters to speak of. People and civilization are all part of a broader natural landscape. Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case.",1
It's a film without an accompanying screenplay. From this subtle theme the film does indeed make sense. How baroque.,1
"Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set.",1
weird. LOVE the painting gag.,1
Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. The writing was of course amazing too. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war. With Brando n this film you don't want to look into his eyes. To me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Most others just display and show you the horrors of war. Like the movie he was freakish.,1
). ',1
That's not a joke... that's a sober truth. The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial.,1
In this movie Tom is returning home as a college graduate. Ma adapts far more quickly than Pa. He played the part to perfection. < br / > < br / > There are two plots intertwined in this movie.,1
Pj Give me modern plumbing and I'll gladly become a Kettle. We don't even get a hint of where all of those children came from! Humor does NOT require offensive language.,1
"So when it seems that there is a real murder, the actors are truly terrified while Carle and his sidekick are convinced it's all a hoax. Full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night.",1
The three men ask for refugee in an old Mansion which happens to be property of one of Ames'old acquaintances.,1
< br / > < br / > That said DO SUGGEST YOU SEE IT.,1
"org. < br / > < br / > They play off of each other superbly. < br / > < br / > For low budget poverty row picture, this film has superb set decoration and great costuming. < br / > < br / > There is a great scene where Homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him.",1
"All I can say is.. this is a nice "" chick "" flick! Through their men, their career, the decades that defined them.",1
Did I imagine this?,1
Thank you Warner Bros!,1
"< br / > < br / > Rich and Famous is catty, campy, witty and wise. Watch it and you'll see why.",1
The unsung hero of his generation.,1
"It's a sweet folkloric tale of the West that hits every target John Ford takes aim at. After all, isn't the spirit of the Christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve?",1
'If you like films of this genre you can't fail to like this one.,1
This movie belongs in top ten. That is a tricky and brave thing to do.,1
"The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point. And a great musical score.",1
"This is film that truly honors America's pioneers and is full of sentiment and feeling. As he said himself,'It couldn't have happened to a nicer fella '.",1
"Always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, most poignantly captured in the Joad family of Steinbeck's'The Grapes of Wrath ( 1940 ).",1
"< br / > < br / > Anyone can enjoy this movie. I want to hear the whole thing sometime. The look on his face as the horse finally dumps him and gallops away is priceless. It must have been risky for the actors, the stunt people and the animals as well.",1
The famous ripped pants of Ward Bond.,1
It was very good but certainly not perfect. I found the Sons of the Pioneers'music a bit schmaltzy at times. He was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film.,1
"Ward Bond is his usual marvelous, blustery self. So they hire Travis and Sandy as wagon masters for their trip.",1
Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest.,1
"What's more, the absence of real interior scenes means the outdoors could lose its impact over time. < br / > < br / > However, Ford was a real maestro when it came to manipulating space. The Western can be divided into many sub - genres.",1
it'certainly not boring.,1
You can't help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary. But what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality.,1
9 / 10.,1
"Young Johnson and Carey, Jr. come off real well, but this is Bond's film to shine as he has the best lines.",1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. High recommended viewing.,1
Worden lived to be 91. Ward Bond even outshines Ben Johnson in this movie. He was still making movies when he died.,1
"My vote is eight. The sequences with the wagon train crossing the desert and the hills are impressive. < br / > < br / > "" Wagon Master "" is another great western of John Ford.",1
"Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz.",1
He turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader.,1
It took several years for me to love this picture. I kept waiting for something to happen. ( The other westerns have exterior action AND interior emotion. ) I thought it was incredibly boring. That is why the movie can be called a poem.,1
Foolish Boy. An undefeated trial record ought to get some recognition I would think. < br / > < br / > In fact my favorite scene is Burr and Baio at a sidebar with the judge. Of course Harper has a number of other people who loved her equally as much. Of course Clohessy has some access to sources that the cops just don't have.,1
Strong story. The filming is worthy of this film stock.,1
"It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us.",1
Worth every moment! This is no small feat.,1
i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion. you actually FEEL like your in Vietnam. i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie. what he means is that this film is about MADNESS and not war. they just don't make movies like this anymore.,1
!,1
Just see it.,1
"When you watch it, notice how well it is put together. I really can't come up with one. You are just taken somewhere on a wave of feeling.",1
al.,1
"Just see it! Dion Dennis, PhD The structure is non - linear and cyclical.",1
What do you do next? It'over. What do you wake up to?,1
The music through the movie was beautiful.,1
It's not for the empty minds. The cut was different and much better. I saw it and later I ordered it. Get angry and hate it.,1
"In fact, there's no credits at all in the film. Somehow that made me think a lot.",1
Another gorgeous scene was when Cpt. < br / > < br / >'Apocalypse'is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study. It is more'Full Metal Jacket'than'Platoon '. ' Capt.,1

"During the final throes of the Vitnam war, our central character, Capt. Kurtz had eventually come to know this.",1
Must have been one of her first roles.,1
"I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie.",1

Love In Limbo is my all - time favoirite movie.,1
"When Coppola states "" This movie isn't about Vietnam - It is Vietnam "" he's right.",1
My Rating : 8 out of 10 Weaknesses : Predictable at points. A group of friends wanting to get laid and become men.,1
A must see series.,1
It is amazing.,1
Video perfectionists will not like this one.,1
"Unless you speak the language, try looking for the other version ( provided you understand English ). This is definitely possible. This was lovely and took some work. It was a pretty unappealing collection of art films.",1
"Awww, I love this!",1
"Funny, charming, and touching. If it's in your town, see it.",1
< br / > < br / > This movie defies categorization. My favourite movie of all time.,1
"Employer is really the wrong term to use, though. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.",1
Certainly worth watching if you are looking for a good courtroom drama.,1
This film blew me away.,1
"It was nice to hear it in the movie. Attica! "" Brought back memories.",1
She left her parents house and got a job. I love! They are best friends.,1
But this show is perfect.,1
It's one of my favorite seasons so far.,1
The first half of the film is very good.,1
"Also, for the most part the acting is superb.",1
it's just fun. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it.,1
she is so awesome.,1
wow! they're simply wonderful!,1
< br / > < br / > So watch it!,1
But it was not. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship. This is definitely an excellent show. It is also very witty.,1
i love this show! i wish my mom was like Lorelei. even their parents watch it now.,1
i watch it every day! i just love them!! !,1

"4. I am a middle - aged straight male, and this is the ONLY weekly TV show I watch.",1
That is how good it is.,1
there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor. Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show of all times.,1
They have their little moments.,1
I was just fascinated with the filmmaking. The two actors are very natural. 7 / 10. There is a lot of that. I personally love the Dogma movement. Fuckland is an interesting film. I wish it had lasted longer. I don't know why.,1
"The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it. Last night, I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK ( KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles ). Oddly, it was 137 minutes long - - slightly longer than the time listed on IMDb. < br / > < br / > The entire focus of the film then changes completely - - to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras, India. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India. You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family.",1
"And oh to be loved by this passionate Henry! Perhaps, she too, could imagine such a Henry.",1
It certainly is amusing.,1

"I hate her. How did it appear? "" Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. Elinor's calm response is stupid too. The marchioness!",1
Highly recommended.,1

Simran has been really good too. In all an amazing movie.,1
Brilliant film!,1
4. They portray it very well and very realistically. I think that that's just rubbish.,1
Even Heath was pretty good in it.,1
I found it to be very enjoyable.,1
Watch it. Love.,1
"Many years ago I saw this movie ( on television maybe? ) It did. Pando has a'job'for Jimmy. In the end, all these'loose ends'tie together beautifully. You just know that a love story will play out between them. It's sort of like a celluloid Moebius strip. < br / > < br / > A highlight of the movie is Bryan Brown's character of Pando.",1
"The love and help of friends guides him to a higher plateau. < br / > < br / > The film is well - directed and well - acted. Two Hands "" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes.",1
Eg. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. Rating my book - 7 ( of 10 ).,1
You have to see!,1
But how wrong I was.,1
"He fits the movie in that he's Australian and looks naive ; but beyond that, he's not the best lead I've ever seen in a movie. If you ask me, Bryan Brown gave the best performance here.",1
"He's vicious, but real. Pando, played by Bryan Brown, is a Sydney Mob boss. So now Jimmy is $ 10, 000 in dept to a major mob boss.",1
It's a shatter to that small kid. And her search to find out who she is. That's a nice view. Mani Ratnam has amazingly improved.,1
"Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it.",1
"Two Hands "" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local "" Big "" Man Pando ( Bryan Brown ). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected.",1
"Apparently, Freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the Civil War. They find a hidden chest of gold on a reconnaissance run and decide to keep it.",1
And believe me they weren't. I think that alone is commendable.,1
Both had its strong points. Oh my gosh! The action was fast paced. The music was better in Posse. It was great! I'm not the biggest fan of westerns.,1
Oh my gosh! The action was fast paced. The music was better in Posse. Both had there strong points. It was great! I'm not the biggest fan of westerns.,1

No other actor could have done this role better. The dialog was excellent if a bit contemporary!,1
"Meanwhile, Cartman finds treasure but wants to keep it all to himself.",1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off.,1
"I don't want to give anything away, but it had me rolling on floor.",1
This was a pretty good episode.,1
"Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis, and Regis Toomey also co - star. < br / > < br / > 7 / 10 I know it left me with a smile on my face. It's just the thing to save his boss Ralph Norton's ( Conrad Bain ) security company.",1
A cute little kiddie flick.,1
Movies have different genera's and different purposes. Memorable. It is also thought provoking. Everyone will see the humor.,1
"Costumes, scenery, and production values are good, too. Will CHOMPS save Norton security?",1
This movie is classic for all ages.,1
This was on odd film.,1

Wow. It was also one of the first VHS tapes that I owned. The story is as powerful now as it was first time I saw it.,1
The old man adds to the humor of the story. Travis Davis plays the role superbly!,1
"On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. On the one hand, I'm happy.",1
The dialog feels very real.,1

All three ladies have their drama ahead of them. He's delightfully charming. Crawford almost steals the film. Her presence and her usual strong bitchy self is fun to watch.,1
Good afternoon fare.,1
And how about Mark Goddard in a non - speaking role. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. < br / > < br / > I lapped this movie up.,1
and is certainly NOT an artistic triumph. Just don't expect Shakespeare!,1
"Harassment hadn't been discovered yet, I guess. His character is offensive as hell, but its not played seriously at all. Isn't that sufficient reason to hate a person? Caroline Bender ( Hope Lange ) is just killing time getting a job. Her real ambition is to marry Eddie and have a baby. Well they are younger, aren't they?",1
"The best of them, Stephen Boyd, is a heavy drinker. Catch it by all means. Life does sometimes imitate art.",1
I love this.,1
They were beautifully and meaningfully picturised. Also the songs are just out of this world!,1
I love the glossy cinemascope films of the 50's and 60's. The look of the bevy of young beauties in it is also memorable. Here we see the male characters and what a bunch they are. Suzy Parker falls from a fire escape.,1
"Take a look at the new DVD transfer and you'll know why. Alas, she's not up to where the film sends her : into madness and obsession.",1
I loved it then and still do. Cheers.,1

This is an incredible movie that begins slowly.,1
What can you possibly say?,1
Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.,1
The logic and humor were definitely accounted for. I can see this being a cult film.,1

The DVD includes commentary by Lieberman. A must see if you like underrated horror films.,1
"And you know what? Yes, it's all the same. It's just magic! Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. It was enjoyable to watch enough not to care. It's one of the best experiences I had watching a slasher movie.",1

"Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Bruno But Bruno knows all about Guy'personal problems.

It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. Never heard of them!! Good thing DVDs don't wear out from use!!!! !,1

In the post Rodney King world a presidential candidate backed the police in sending 43 bullets at an unarmed man. How many times have you been in either person's shoes and made the right choice? He does not solicit help nor does he lie to his would be new wife.,1
Good luck.,1
I think the whole film is just fun. back in the old days.,1
If it came to DVD I'd snap it up in a heartbeat. Then it wasn't as'harmful '.,1
Let's hope so. A good Comedy FIX.,1

"When Charlie wakes up his legs feel numb so he tries to'wake them up '. I can't really describe it, just watch the movie. This is such a funny part! To do so he impersonates a german kolonel or something.",1
Highly recommended. And so the lovable Tramp went to war!,1
What remains is first rate but one leaves wanting more... and feeling a trifle cheated. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918.,1

The movie is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. This is not something that was done by accident. His father sent him to the police station carrying a note.

I laughed from beginning to end.,1
"This film has many memorable bizarre, goofy, wacky moments. That film was finally released on DVD and has developed a cult following. It creates its own absurd universe.",1

Kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for Julia. Amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was good as well. He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda deal with her distress. They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer.,1
"Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock, it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry. These are only brief moments, but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film.",1

You'll see it holds up. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie ( or Trekker - - your preference ) it takes you out of the scene at first.,1
The atmosphere of war - time paranoia is all too real. The chain - mail armor is really cool.,1
"Oddly, for the die - hard Trekkers out there, they'll recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played Spock's father.",1
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts ; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. In fact, I believe this episode holds the record for ship casualties by the end of it.",1
"I also enjoy their journey home. It's incredible. The Ally cat had a great voice! Everyone should see it. I give this film 10 / 10 stars. That part is adorable. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. """,1

"There are hardly any lapses and no dull moments. However with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing. The representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing. < br / > < br / > With Disney, you always get a strong meaningful message.",1
"It looked beautiful. 8. The supporting characters, namely Scat Cat, were also well done.",1

Any fan of Jeff Garlin'TV appearances must see it!,1
"I applaud the decision. He isn't really a sensitive guy. Likable, sure. Is that a good thing? And yet, is it a sensitive guy film? In short, I thought it would be a comedy.",1
"Mina Kolb plays Jeff's mother who he lives with. There were numerous other cameos, all of them done very well. The wordy title should clue you in to this. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. Bonnie Hunt is classically great in her role. This explains why they work so well.",1
Garlin is unquestionably a comedian's comedian and a comedian to anyone looking for a good time. Bonnie Hunt gives an endearing performance as a romantic interest.,1
"But once it starts to take it's toll, it really makes you smile. But I actually thought about this one on the way home. The ending came kind of abruptly and had me saying, "" that's it!? "" It is the kind of movie that you keep watching and always enjoy.",1
"Almost stealing the movie is character actress Mina Kolb, who plays James'pixilated mother with pluck and heart.",1

"He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. at times, but it is very easy to watch. Obviously, you know who will with what I just typed. I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.",1

"By making the usual buildup followed with a loud noise and jerked camera some other scary moments. Paris Hilton appears in this film as many already know, but I really have to give it to her for her ballsy performance. In fact there isn't a slow moment after they get to the small town where the dreaded House of Wax museum is. The causes for horror are in part based on making the audience care for the characters, which we do. Not bad.",1
My vote is seven.,1
I recently saw House of Wax and must say i really enjoyed it.,1
Or a Golden Globe.,1
"< br / > < br / > Now for the death scenes. We meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together. Overall, all the actor's were very good.",1

"Congrats to cast and crew for a job well done. Like she always says - "" That's hot. """,1
"( A clear example is the mindless "" Saint Ange "". ) I don't think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. "".",1
But he has a presence to him. The first is that it is blessed with a very likable cast. < br / > < br / > House of Wax has many strengths.,1
Bravo! It showed how he really cared.,1
I don't think I am alone when I say that 2005 has not been particularly kind to the horror genre. It also gives the young actors portraying them something grip on.,1
"After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN ( Horrible! and moan "" that's hot "" but they didn't do that ( how could they resist??? ).",1
It is definitely worth a watch.,1

"So overall, I liked it. So the mismatched pair begins their adventure together.",1
How do we get from thing to thing is often beyond me. Very very funny at times. < br / > < br / > Can a movie that starts off the rails go off the rails? Another go round with the monkey king going west.... sort of. Action and comedy aside this is actually a wonderful love story.,1
But it really didn't matter because I still enjoyed it to it's full length. Sometimes people has to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start yapping about. So you better be as experienced and open minded. ! And people quit whining about how it borrowed from other movies!,1
"He seems to vary from being a prickly kind of patriot to being a kind of'anything for the cause,'fellow. < br / > < br / > This is a great spy movie. It's not quite a great historical drama, but it does satisfy well enough.",1
All the main characters are well cast.,1
WTF is up with the world? There is some really serious stuff mixed with super interesting footage of the road. The thing that's best is the kaliedescope style. I can't get this flick off my brain.,1

The movie is about Bartelby.,1
"And may be sometimes the children know better what they need than their parents. You what they say "" If there is a will there is a way.

'The humour was varied which I loved.,1

I expected either Jed or the colonel's wife to reap some retribution for their sin.,1
"First off, I absolutely loved this movie.",1
"Warning - - this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. It's a real shame.",1
That's right. With many systems.,1
"I'm's sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact. Art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off "" Oh Won. "" But he refuses to be manipulated. It is not surprising that this film was made by I'm at the time it was.",1

But some of these characters were used too much. Just don't expect a smooth ride. Why?... I had no problem with any of them in end. < br / > < br / > 7 of 10 but almost a 6.,1

This is not the basic Kung - fu movie.,1
"This is a video game and not an actual movie. What if Jen had not gotten back her comb? < br / > < br / > The story is obviously based on the story told in the movie. But, dude, what are you talking about?",1
to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. The image's can actually blow your mind.,1
"I cannot hate on the show. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. < br / > < br / > AHEM! Sorry. Some segments and bits they do are funny. It's music, movies, comic books, the internet and television.",1
"7 of 10 ; it will keep you in a young mindset which is good if you're a younger Baby Boomer like me ( mid 40's ). Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. Maybe a cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do, there is a ton of stuff available they could use. I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ).",1
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. Sweet.,1
To compare the two shows is like comparing apples to oranges! I give it an 8 out of 10.,1
My favorite show of all time!,1
"Also, the writing was very strong.",1
Here are a few examples. Kid A may synchronise with EVERY episode! < br / > < br / > 2.,1
"They couldn't be more unaware. This show revolves around that kind of stuff. Everyone has problems, and we all must learn to work around them. Her Mom works at some office but is sometimes a stay at home parent. Alex is unpopular and picked on by most of her peers.",1
It shows. A true cinematic work of art from a visionary director. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this movie.,1
A recommended movie for whole family.,1
"357! < br / > < br / > Slaughter is now stumped. Wow, that's an interesting twist! And, naturally, there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the process. And, because job was bungled so badly, the mob boss ( Ed MacMahon!! )",1
"SMACK!! Why, I don't know.",1
"Every few minutes there appears one or more of the following : drug use, sex, nudity, gunplay, murder or some other action. McMahon is a riot! Seeing Johnny Carson's sidekick in a role like this is a perverse thrill. Sadly, no mention at all is made of Brown's original sidekicks Don Gordon and Stella Stevens.",1
Something the original was lacking. Even Shaft.,1
Understated in terms of dialogue but powerful in terms of presence.,1
I hope we see much more of her in the coming years. High recommended.,1
I loved it.,1

I liked this movie a lot. That's how much I like it.,1
Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces : the temptation.,1
And a more off - the - wall storyline too!,1
"I promise you will not be disappointed! This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! I haven't even read the book, and guess what? I don't care. I recommend it to people of all ages.",1

Enchanting. It's music is also very nice.,1
She injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season corrupted by the devil's evil magic. Instead it shows new ideas some real thinking on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the old themes of love and danger.,1
This is possibly one of my favorite films.,1
It is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes.,1
"It's the best, and you will see what I mean.",1
"There are other parallels with the later work, too, which lead one to suspect a touch of a remake.",1
The overall tone and mood is excellent.,1
A beautiful piece of filmmaking.,1
It's Showtime!,1
This is actually great fun. ! The acting is a lot of fun!.,1
You'll love it.,1

"Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. Thanks for I guess I do though. < br / > < br / > I hope you enjoy the film.",1
The rest is strictly suspense and action. But that'just the funny part.,1
"Not any more. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. You know what? There are chases, shootouts and explosions.",1
"I am not saying this lightly. It is light, funny, and very restful. I simply love this movie.",1
"Rene Russo is also great as the TV producer. Rating 8 of 10 stars. < br / > < br / > Murphy really shines in this one. Man, that was hilarious!",1
"I never knew that, "" he muses, impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced. But then, that's how unrealistic the comedy is.",1
And very well done.,1
"And who do you suppose they're going to come up with for that? And just like that, show is on. If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you pretty much know what to expect, because what you see here is what you get.",1
Those are by far the funniest scenes.,1
I absolutely hate the idea of made for television films. I was surprised. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AS TO PLOT!!!!!,1

This is a fun film with a neat cast.,1
"Anyway, it's fascinating reading.",1
I always remember someone who had The drama starts when the stowaways enter the vast cavernous holds of the ship. This ship seemed to have a vast armoury. Africa is notorious for stowaway pickups. I question the use of guns in this film. So far normal. The crew pop ashore for a little intercourse and inebriation.,1
Give this movie a try.,1
Highly recommend.,1
You won't regret it. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.,1
I LOVE IT!,1

All and all a great movie that I would recommend. I wonder why certain actors make it and certain ones don't.,1

The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. < br / > < br / > The lyrics of many of Holly's songs are pretty adolescent ; read the lyrics for "" Peggy Sue "" or "" Oh Boy!

"It startled even me, But I had never truly listened to his music. I'm torn on my views of this film. I also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies. First, I'm a huge Buddy Holly fan. They wore me out! But others.. ouch.",1

That really makes him good! He does have a spitting image to the man. 5 STARS! GOD BLESS YOU GARY BUSEY! That's one of the reasons he didn't act like Elvis. That's what I call tolerance. He stuck to his kinder ways.,1
How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? I've got to say it.,1
He died.,1
"However, it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to Buddy's wife after his death. ). It would be unwise to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other. The testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of Buddy.",1
or any of the other popular singers of this generation? What a great film!,1
A fun little fright flick. The moody score by Jerry Mosely likewise hits the shuddery spot.,1
It's just a fad. Gary Busey attempts to capture this aspect of Buddy's persona. The heyday for 3 - D was in the early 1950's.,1
"It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. This leads to the funniest scene in a film filled with humorous moments. The DJ has been playing "" The kids love it and the parents hate it.",1

Gee!,1
"0 when equated with the IMDb scale. This film promises much but delivers little. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. Where's Groucho when you need him? I wonder if someone will make a movie of Irish immigrants which will include a Sicilian woman as a major character. Note that the immigrants speak of "" America "", not the "" United States "" - - the ideal vs. the political reality. 25, raised to a 7.

"Not this movie - - we get a sense for life below decks, and it isn't charming. There must be some symbolism there, but I couldn't make sense of it. ( We never actually see the Statue of Liberty, either. ) Still, large screen or small screen, it's worth seeking out. Not here - - the Ellis Island experience occupies about one - third of footage. < br / > < br / > The film begins with scenes in a poor, rural region of Sicily.",1

!,1
It was never supposed to make sense. ( Duh! The rating was lowered about TWENTY years later! < br / > < br / > Now where was I?,1
Pity the Monkees.,1
They said it over and over in interviews.,1
"< br / > < br / > No, you don't have to be inebriated to enjoy it. Many people that I've asked "" Did you know the Monkees made a movie? "" Sadly, this movie is relegated to'curio'status it seems. Overall, it is an experience. usually answer'No.",1
"Well, there really isn't one, as many have said. The crew later made both "" Easy Rider "" and "" Five Easy Pieces "". < br / > < br / > The plot? Its all their loss.",1
"Hey, hey, they're the Monkees, and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around! The other three Monkees only acted in it. < br / > < br / > In the end, even their deaths did not set them free. No problem!",1
It is bewildering to discover that they blamed failure of this film on bad promo. Pretend it's not happening : when the Monkees commit group suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge! Witness : futile protests against the Vietnam War leap out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear! Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.,1
Think Sean Penn and Jack. It is a common technique. It is bad because it took risks. < br / > < br / > Jack writes.,1
"They want everything explained and all questions answered in the finale. To complain about "" Head "" is like complaining about a dream you've had that you felt you could not understand. And just when I think I've figured out something in the film, it's answer is destroyed once I watch the film again. and "" Long Title : Do I Have To Do This All Over Again?

"To many, frustrating. I am... proud of'Head ', "" Mike Nesmith has said. Is he lesser or better the man? """,1

Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers. 'he brings'natural'to the screen. She plays well off Garfield.,1
Another enjoyable Warner flick.,1
"Garfield who was only 26 at the time brought the best out of everyone in the movie. 00 of the $ 10, 000.",1
And the whiskey. A police chase ends with a fiery car crash. But he's also presumed dead. Manager and girl are dead and unrecognizable.,1

This is breezy highly entertaining drama with an excellent cast. ).,1
"It's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you weren't expecting it. < His character is Monty Phelan, and he has a pretty good hunch that the body in the car crash wasn't Johnny.",1

"The script by Don Mancini is great fun, very fast moving, highly entertaining & references plenty of other horror film with good affection. While Tiffany takes a bath Chucky escapes, electrocutes her & using that book brings her back to life in the shape of a female doll dressed as a bride.",1
"Thinking he has been set up, he confronts them about it.",1
No time is wasted.,1
Still worth it.,1
"Thus, the movie's also about the allures of capitalism. In that sense, the movie has indeed dated.",1
I love this show.,1
"The more I think about the movie, the more it grows on me. I didn't understand a lot of things about "" Putney Swope "", but for the most part, I liked it.",1
Imagine the times.,1
The script is priceless. What Plot?? How Many Syllables Mario? I also see a little bit of Monty Python in this. Keep Scratching!! This film is not about PLOT! Nothing is sacred. The editing is only so - so.,1

The lines just keep on coming in the movie. Deff.,1
Crew?,1
It's enjoyable watching Bronson ( Paul Kersey ) rid the streets of these thugs. I also really liked the soundtrack to this movie.,1
Mandy! It's so evil sounding. 3. Ha!,1
"This movie used the very straightedge way to tell the story. Due to the chance given by Insp. Kersey decided to set the war with Franker and his gang. However, Death Wish 3 was the very interested film. She could have more role to appear.",1
"Gabin perfectly incarnates the aging French playboy hero. Arnoul is a cute redhead who holds her own in the dance numbers, except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously used.",1
This movie was great. This is great stuff.,1
"Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so. The'climax'is just a laugh riot. LOL. It's so bad it's actually good lol.",1
Bronson does it all in this film. He goes into the dentistry business.,1
"All in all, a true classic.",1
! Tons of non - stop action!,1
It ain't Spielberg and it ain't art. The violence is over the top.,1

What do I call this apparently new sense.,1
Thanks to Herzog for ( re ) introducing him to us. It's a very interesting and well executed film. < br / > < br / > Dengler is a fascinating and extremely likable person.,1

She also acts circles around the boring Harvey. Lee Seidl is funny as the landlady. Harris'Sally preens and prances about and growls out a very lascivious laugh. Ron Randell plays the caddish Clive but seems a tad loud. These two characters couldn't be more unalike.,1
Larry is so funny at portraying a wimpish hypochondriac.,1

Joe stark naked is crouching on floor feeding crumbs of cake to his little baby. There is no sound, no dialogue. Or could it be that this approach was intentional? Surely not.",1

And expressiveness is a major point to be found in Kahn's architecture.,1
"Not good enough. Each of these children has visibly lost something. The man was a sculptor on a grand scale who spoke of his craft in airy terms of silence and art. The answers Nathaniel Khan is looking for seem hollow. The funeral service, when the filmmaker was just a boy, was, shall we say, an unpleasant surprise.

He and his parents settled in Philadelphia where the talented youngster loved art and music. That inflexibility was the reason that while he drew wonderful plans for many buildings he built but a few.",1
Don't Torture a Duckling features an absolutely great Italian cast. The murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys.,1
A standout scene.,1
I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films.,1
Fulci beats him with this one. It's more of a straight horror movie. The music is ridiculously perfect. The setting is perfect : an old Italian village.,1
"Composer Riz Ortolani bookends these carnage - filled scenes with ferocious reverberating string blasts. Catholic guilt and grisly slayings are such a resonant combination. If anything, this adds even more potency to Fulci's message.",1
< br / > < br / > What went wrong Lucio? What a surprise this film was.,1
Someone else? The rich girl?,1
"The acting is also pretty good and the photography is great. What I don't like is that it can be confusing at times, especially at the end.",1
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development.,1
"Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino "" aka. "" Bodies of little boys are found in rural Sicily. The acting performances are among the best in Italian Horror cinema.",1
Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore.,1
But this is no slasher film. This person kills little children. A legitimate theme undergirds the story.,1
10 / 10 for me.,1
"< br / > < br / > This is a remarkable film. Don't Torture a Duckling "" hardly contains any gore, yet ranks as his best.",1
What crazy reasoning he had. Can you? She also tries to tempt the local priest. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.,1
"But my stubbornness prevailed and I had to check out more of his films. The plot is well constructed, not easily figured out and the end conclusion is very satisfying. < br / > < br / > While not a traditional giallo film, Duckling has many of the genre's trademarks.",1
"Talk about your prime red herring. I think it's justly hailed as one of the director's most accomplished achievements. Everything just clicks. A surprisingly effective mystery, a good cast and imaginatively shot against an unusual rural setting.",1
"In a small, picturesque Sicilian village, someone is brutally killing young, sexually curious boys. The acting, particularly Bolkan, is also very good.",1
8,1
"Oh... that title DOES eventually make perfect sense, too!",1
Fulci also develops himself as a genius storyteller here. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema!,1
If only all the films he made after were like this. < br / > < br / > ( 10 out of 10 )... of course! This is Lucio Fulci at his best.,1

The Hunt 2. Coincidence?,1
It is claustrophobic and colorful.,1
"None can figure it out. < br / > < br / > The title seems to be suggested by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, Pirandello's famous play. This uncertainty of what is going on allows the viewers to think it is an abstract drama.",1

"No sooner has Amir First, no celebrity stars appear in it. The chief themes here are cowardice and redemption.",1
"The storyline is so powerful that almost any script or screenplay would have done justice to it. They can put any matured actor to shame. I have read both the book and saw the movie today. At least for this movie, one should try to connect to it rather than judging it objectively. So nothing much there.",1
Last night I finally picked it up. I am very glad that I did. Showed me a place that was beautiful. It is one of best I have ever seen.,1
But the Hungarian Revolution collapsed due to bad timing. His comic turn in ONCE MORE WITH FEELING was quite nice.,1
"The actors and actresses have great performances, giving credibility to the realistic story. In 1979, the Russians invade Afghanistan and Baba and Amir escape to Pakistan. In 1988, they have a simple life in Fremont, California, when Amir graduates in a public college for the pride and joy of Baba. Later Amir meets his countrywoman Soraya ( Atossa Leoni ) and they get married.",1
"Also, please note the sound heard every time a kite line is cut. < br / > < br / > Regarding the movie, I feel it was masterfully done. It was AMAZING.",1
"Even after seeing the movie several times "" he was sobbing "".",1
And the guy who played Amir as an adult was great! There is a way to be good again. The scenes between him and Baba were especially touching.,1

"He respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered through at sometime. Not shown who has taken their lives or reasons known, time skips back to the start of the day. At 2 : 37, a high school student commits suicide. The factor on Thalluri's talent is his subtlety. While the core of each film is different, both tackle teen life.",1
"I missed by a mile. Sad, isn't it? I hope he has more coming.",1
"And finally, there are decent placements of music. It does not compromise nor does it serve laughter. There is no : friendship, love, smiling, truth, passion. < br / > < br / > Let's stick to the movies'technique. And that is what keeps this movie from being really good. That's what really impressed me.",1
Do not miss it.,1

"How can it not be considered realistic. that happens all the time. so there are a lot of things to relate to. and many viewers are probably concerned with there education such as Marcus. Many of them aren't going to come out and say it, and mostly these are victims. Who can't relate to being an outcast or being bullied?",1

"This is a charming little film, which like many of it's kind, derives it's charm from the circumstances involved rather than the actual dialogue. It is also putting him in the 80 - 90 % tax bracket and as penniless as he is he now faces a tax bill of over $ 17, 000.",1

"The intimacy and pacing drew me in and never let me go. I am a film directors nightmare... especially of the mega buck, multiplex variety. By the end I was fascinated and repelled and utterly unable to tear my eyes away from that film too.",1
This is as it should be.,1
Many people remember the Waco standoff that occurred a long time ago. Most people feel the cult was at fault for not agreeing with the FBI on reasonable terms. This video is frightening and I highly recommend it if one can find it. It will make your blood boil. What is even more shocking is the actions of the FBI when they entered the Mount Carmel.,1
If you value your freedom! I won't mention its name since I'm a coward. They even hinted the Davidians had it coming.,1
"< br / > < br / > The picture puts on many masks to tell its story. It was the Republicans that seemed open to the other side. Communications between two were spirited but eventually broke down. I watched a made for television film about the destruction at Waco, Texas.",1
I was amazed.,1
And it's at times superfluous for those who watched the CSPAN hearings and the 60 Minutes reports. The film someone had to make.,1
Do we really want to give away our freedoms to these people? Is it worth it?,1
"Shaky, annoying... like the characters.",1
"But this is the first film that had me seething with anger after I saw it. I even think this should be shown in classes - it's that important. I voted for the man when I lived in NY state - I'm a Democrat, pretty left - leaning too. But none of it was illegal.",1
"A big cover up by the FBI, a massacre by gung - ho / trigger happy government agents? These are questions that I haven't been given answers to by the government. Most importantly, what about the children? Both are equally frightening. I clearly remember the Waco standoff, I was 17 years old at the time and watched it all on CNN.",1
They were simply standing up for there rights to bear arms and practice their religion as American Citizens. Rules of Engagement is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Why pour gallons of harmful gas if you want to save children? If you are the FBI why engage in psychological warfare and offer little in actual negotiation to help solve situation? Why open large holes within the compound structure when you know the possibility of starting a fire? The cover up is what left me really fuming.,1

Bill Hickman was driver of the bad guy car in both movies. They gave it a good try in Seven Ups though with the chase scene. Bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds.,1

The Seven - Ups is a good and engrossing film.,1
"Quick moving and intense, fresh for thirty years.",1
This is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings. < br / > < br / > Everyone has an opinion about car chases.,1
He has emotional range and we see how losing his cop and friend takes it's toll on him. The film isn't overly complex after the plot is set - up and we realize who is the ring - leader in the scheming of mobsters. Scheider has never been given the credit he deserves as a fine lead actor.,1
The climactic shootout likewise delivers the stirring goods. A real bang - up little winner.,1
We get to see unpleasantness and a pre - 1990s New York City.,1
"I truly miss those times. "". A great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture.",1
"And yes, the car chase is one of the all - time best.",1
"You Are Alone "" is that movie ( for me ). Amazing soundtrack!!! The ending was perfect. !",1
"Buddy is a cop who works in a sub rosa unite of the NYPD, the Seven Ups, that does things "" their way "" to clean up the streets of New York of criminals. < br / > < br / > Roy Scheider who is not a big man is as tough and effective as any big action actor I can think off like Clint Eastwood would have been in the same movie.",1
It could be a G movie today! Locations that were bleak and dehuman They mirror my attitude. What it did have was a great NYC backdrop to a simple crime story. The undertakers. It had no subplots or amusing character developments.,1
Academy Awards follow. The chase is staged by Philip D'Antoni. Bill Hopkins drives the criminal vehicle. It's a success.,1
"Overall a decent cop action / drama, not really my thing but I liked this one. Richard Lynch happens to be one of these sleaze - bags, and he's as creepy as ever. Look for Joe Spinell ( Maniac ) in a small role. But that's only the beginning. 7 out of 10.",1
The chase goes on for nearly 15 minutes and is the best you'll ever see. You can tell that Lo Bianco's enjoying the game throughout the movie.,1
"Not out on DVD yet, though. A keeper. One of my favorites.",1
"A stringy, screechy score by Don Ellis sets the perfect mood. ( That VW bug going about 2 mph always bothers me in the Bullitt chase. ) Before then, there was too much Hays Code - constricted pap. THE SEVEN UPS : bleak, grim, action - oriented, grown - up.",1

The plot ( there's an actual plot line here? ) No doubt about it. Powers was experimenting with at the time ).,1
"But Mickey is not to be outdone in nastiness. If you're a fan of Mickey Mouse, or Disney in general, this is one steamboat you can't afford to miss. '",1

"This is because it was the first sound cartoon. STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history. However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.",1
He does not yet speak either.,1
I was able to get this cartoon on tape and I really like it. He could just whistle and play music.,1
"The true answer is "" Plane Crazy "" not "" Steamboat Willy "". These dates can be checkout on IMDb under "" release dates.",1
< br / > < br / > Strongly recommended.,1
"OF COURSE!!!!!!! """,1
"Nazarin by the acclaimed surrealist Bunuel is ovbviously an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values. Truth, be told the Nazarene is also selfish because he gives without wanting in return or asking for it. It is not a visual film and I think it would have played better on the stage.",1
"Nazarin appears credible as it has been made in a light, comical vein. This is a film which should be with any discerning DVD collector.",1
"It concerns the individual's struggle for humanity and altruism amongst a society that rejects any notion of virtue. < br / > < br / > This is a remarkable film and I would urge anyone interested in classic cinema to seek it out. Father Nazarin, however, is portrayed more sympathetically than Sister Viridiana.",1
"With this, Andara search mercy from the priest. In other side is Andara, one of the towns prostitutes. He lived in a simple and poor region. She have a kind of repulse to him.",1
"Great films, but not masterpieces. Third, I saw L'Age d'Or. His superiors assume the same and punish him for it. Later on, he suffers even worse punishments from clerics.",1
"In any case, great film.",1
"Luis Buñuel unabashedly praising a Jesus - like figure?? "" Perhaps we've only been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey. < br / > < br / > "" What?? ( Alas, if he can't do good in this world, who can? ) And who says the priest couldn't eventually emerge from that "" dark night "" and regain his confidence?",1
"Francisco Rabal is superb as the priest. Definitely, one of the filmmaker'best movies.",1
"Nazarin's life parallels that of Jesus. This was one of his best roles. < br / > < br / > Nazarin, by all reckoning, is a saint. Rita Macedo, as Andara, is also excellent. In fact, this saintly figure makes a case for humility.",1
"Daphne is intelligent, yet clearly still an eighteen year old. Their appointment climaxes with the story's concluding twist.",1
"! Oh, the memories!",1
"All his words amount to nothing. On Nazarin's way, only brambles and couch grass grow.",1
"< br / > < br / > I consider Bunuel one of best filmmakers ever. The film is simple and profound as well as beautiful, ironic, and heartbreaking.",1
In terms of plot their is enough of other things going on to keep you interested.,1
There's also fine score by Raymond Wong as well.,1
Do yourself a favour and see this film!,1
A truly fascinating and entertaining watch! Top notch casting!,1
"So simple yet so powerful. It's a Johnny To film after all, it has to. That's the plot in a nutshell. When he'good, he's REAL good.",1
"To an extent, it is. No car chases.",1
"Overall, a really solid film. I've recently seen An zhan.",1
The dialog is realistic and most of the scenes hold up surprisingly well. * * * of 4 stars. This film came on the heels of the success of Rebel Without A Cause in 1955.,1
"Shipley, James Gergory, tells Hal that his dad is coming to pick him up when he finally sobers up to the fact of what he's done. * * * SPOILERS * * * Well made and interesting film about the alienated youth of America back in the 1950's.",1
"Young Stranger "" represents his Hollywood debut.",1
Arguably this is one of the best.,1
< br / > < br / > We are still in those semi - mythic 50s when teenagers drove jalopies and jeans were still dungarees.,1

8. And while it is a little cliché'e and over the top its good.,1
"She ignores him, but since he has a cute friend, she joins his group. It would seem that Cardone finally found the right script and cast. Still, I found the tool - using child zombies in this movie interesting. The film is deliberately paced, which I liked.",1
"Cardone brings it to life... er.. uh death. The actors believe, so we believe.",1
"The eldest daughter is rebellious, obnoxious... a typical teen. It was so spooky! Not by a long shot. Excellent acting.",1
The characters of the children and the principals are GREAT! Typical horror movie fare.,1
"Second, they can't die. How did they die exactly to become zombies? Yep, only at night. She really needs to start starring in more horror movies.",1
"Bah! "" < br / > < br / > Anyway, The Mikado is a compleat S & G operetta. ( Yes, I put the composer first. It's got a wonderful degree of craziness.",1
and I left pleasantly surprised. The film works on many levels.,1
Wicked Little things was a really good movie.,1
"The film's fascinating cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style at times. < br / > < br / > The film is also well produced. By the time I finished it the old saying "" those who can not learn from the past are doomed to relive it "" was echoing in the mind. Having finally been able to get the DVD of this 1997 HBO film, is at down to watch it.",1
"Living in a free society has its drawbacks. This film is bone chilling in a way that is hard to describe. Likewise, it is not illegal to either own guns or to pray toward Mecca.",1
9,1
"Next time we'll bring them * BOTH * down. "" This movie was just unbelievable. This was actually said by Ramzi Yousef after his arrest. It could have been easily prevented.",1
< br / > < br / > All I can say about this film is don't watch it alone.,1
And our sadness is that most of us need to be beaten up to realize the dangers surrounding us. < br / > < br / > Let's focus.,1
"Focus is another great movie starring William H. Macy. Newman is the head of Human Resources for a company which is basically, anti - Semite. The scene is set after World War II, at the height of McCarthyism. The chilling thought is that in some places, probably still is.",1
So I told her to see the movie.,1
A MUST TO SEE.,1
"All of other main characters do a fine job as well. Foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner, lipstick, and blush everywhere. I really enjoy this particular production of "" The Mikado. "" and Lesley Garrett as Yum - Yum. ). Liberties were also taken with the setting.",1
It deals with anti - Semitism in a very realistic way. I'm a huge fan of legendary director Elia Kazan. Both Macy and Dern's performances are outstanding!,1
"The Christian and the Jew. And that only, because he looks like one. The actors do good job. That makes their lives unbearable.",1
"Larry seemed to think so because her name was "" Hart. "" At times that seemed a little heavy - handed to me.",1
Go see it to find out. It touched me. Emotionally intense. Chilling. The writing incredible.,1
"If he has long hair, he smokes dope. Those statements all sound equally ( im ) plausible to me.",1
"His presence brings unexpected results. < br / > < br / > A tough, emotionally charged film.",1
The message lurks there too.,1
"Post war anti - semitism is setting here, but there is injustice at all times and in all places. This movie packs a punch. It is for the individual to decide where he or she stands. Soon after he gets glasses because of poor vision.",1
"Is he Jewish, is he not?",1
< br / > < br / > Attributed to Rev. Inaction makes one no less culpable.,1
"Cleopatra 2525 is a very funny, entertaining show. They all are different, but as a team, they work really well.",1
"It is superficial. It isn't like any other series. I will never forget Hel, Sarge and Cleo. And that's why I like it.",1
"I can imagine feminists have their fun with this, too. < br / > < br / > Well, what can I say.",1
'Beep Beep'also sees a great improvement in the representation of Wile E. Coyote. There's also a very funny longer gag involving some rocket - powered roller - skates.,1
"Here, the comedy reaches a peak. after the blast.",1
And Eric is hotter than ever.,1
Predictable?,1
I think I am some kind of Road Runner fan.,1
The colors are magnificent.,1
"But that's just scratching the surface. < br / > < br / > On some level, this is a movie about sex. People are constantly being whipped and stabbed. On another whole level, it's a stoner's paradise.",1
"Most important, it had a weird edge to it. It's not a movie for everyone.",1
It even has an original classical style musical score. Throats get slit. Some brutal stabbings. A terrified girl'head explodes. Excellent. She offs one of the leads by plunging a cross in his skull.,1
Very Entertaining and Original. Who fills Stefan in on the Evils a foot.,1
I'm not complaining. It's like somebody wound her up and turned her loose. It's in the ideas.,1
"Yawn, I thought. Great visuals, cool soundtrack, lots of interesting ideas. It all seemed pretty predicable.",1
It was number 15 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. Very good! Frost is the nanny who does not let the kids win.,1
That goes for all races today. How do I know this?,1
"Supernanny Jo Frost, in each episode, gives a family the benefit of her hard - earned experience.",1

"I'm not really bothered if it's not as good as the TV series, because I loved it.",1
< br / > < br / > Watch!,1
"However, I loved it anyways! This makes Mr Bean look like the watered down wimp he is.",1
"The Gentlemen have fun breaking the fourth wall, though, and even add a new element : a second fictional world ( "" them days "" ). Pauline and Mickey have cameos ( no Ross though - strange ), although I would've loved to've seen more of Ms. Campbell - Jones. Papa Lazarou is accounted for, as are Tubbs and Edward.",1
I was so excited to see what the Gents had done and how they'd done it. < br / > < br / > And it was excellent! And you know you've enjoyed a very clever and funny film.,1
"The best British Comedy Film ever! Dads Army ', the list goes on.",1

Would Hilary Briss have wanted to try save Royston Vasey in the series? For many this will be a really enjoyable 90 minutes.,1
< br / > < br / > The film was complicated ( in a good way ) and very very funny.,1
"< br / > < br / > If that sounds a bit too serious, don't be put off. If you're new to The League of Gentlemen, this is an easy introduction and a lot of fun. they can write other stuff - and it can be very funny. ( But you knew that anyway. )",1

"I am referring to Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane. Some of the characters may have done stupid things, but they good hearts. Curtiz made sure no scene, soapy or otherwise, went on too long.",1
The two gate swinging scenes are pure movie magic. ( Imagine a Jimmy Stewart or someone in the part. ),1
"A raft of supporting actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, May Robson, and Eddie Acuff, makes it all believable. Ann is the eternal optimist, even when she and Mickey are down and out.",1
"However, true stardom was not to be. Claude Rains is warm and wonderful as the patriarch. Then she meets ne'er - do - well Mickey Borden, who falls for her as well.",1
"The fates are against me. Ann urges him to create a beginning and an end. But he says, "" It stinks. """,1
"Throughout, the craftsmanship is enough to inspire awe.",1
"< br / > < br / > The acting isn't the best here. Because it tries. For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them. Okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side. Some of those ideas are included here.",1
Ann ( Priscilla Lane ) is a romantic.,1
My rating is 10.,1
A tour - De - force of cinema. Outstanding in ambition and it's unceasing plummet into depths of human emotion.,1
"L'Homme Blesse is not for an impatient, adventure - seeking audience. There are no explosions nor is the drama straightforward.",1

"Coincidence maybe, or evidence that Taymor's influence is pervasive. Min Tanaka is the dancing Oedipus to Langridge's singing Oedipus. Red ribbons are a recurring theme. The current Butterfly at ENO uses Japanese puppetry. I would love to see a Ring cycle directed by her. One can only hope that she can be persuaded to return to opera one day.",1

Ugh. I wish I could have met Ida Lupino.,1

"It's amazing what impact a good story and great actors can make. It has been almost 50 years since I saw "" Jennifer "" for the first and only time.",1
"Well, Deep Blood is far from that. It is a cheap as film making can get and on the other side it is creative as well.",1
The Violent Men is a good western. < br / > < br / > The cast is a highlight.,1
What a cast!,1
"Ten years later, Stanwyck would star as the matriarch of the Barkley Family on "" The Big Valley "". For that, Parrish also had something to say - "" Never meet the enemy on his terms "".",1
"It is worth waiting for. Then, there's Barbara Stanwyck, the real ruler of the roost. This is the classic western.",1
"Talk about getting even big - time. Kind of a neat added bit of justice, he kills this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cowhand. I really enjoyed this movie. But, that's just what he is about to do.",1
"But The Violent Men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the missed opportunities evident with the production. Well i slept on it and decided to ponder further about the picture. But for what it is, Robinson's crutch toting "" bad "" guy is at the least memorable for all the right reasons. While Eddie G, when one gets used to him being in a Western, is fine in what is an under written part.",1
I loved it.,1
Glenn Ford was the only box office draw at the time. He has a very original confrontation with the main gunfighter about midway into the film.,1
Then you know what happens next.,1
Great action and mostly quick paced. A western through and through.,1
Highly recommended. It's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars. It also featured realistic people in a realistic setting. Ford had the bulk of the dialog.,1
"No matter to Barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother - in - law Brian Keith. But The Violent Men is something special. He's every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often.",1

I would give it a 10 out of 10 rating but I am giving it a 8 for two reasons. We both loved the movie. I love Almodovar's films. The film has aged well : the 1980s costumes and hairdos add to the wackiness.,1

Knowwhaddamean? You've surely seen him somewhere.,1
Far from it. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character. At least until he was reinvented.,1
She was really cute in this movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who asks!,1
"Jimmy Buffet's music was a plus, and the scenery was wonderful...",1
Ste.,1
! a perfect family film.,1
"A good, solid film, all in all.",1
"I mean, the it just flowed too easily. Well worth your time to see this!",1
The music is not too shabby. I rate this film a 9 / 10.,1
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher. A bit predictable. And those baby owls were adorable.,1
"It's really a simple story, but also one that they need to hear at this age. My kids particularly loved all the different animals, from snakes, to owls to alligators. Hoot was terrific.",1
Unlike when he evaded the police.,1
!,1
"< br / > < br / > I was pleasantly surprised. It was a kids movie that works just fine for adults or teenagers, too. I read the book in a summer book club, and all of us there loved it.",1
He kept us adults awake.,1
I'd recommend it to any everyone. I have to get to get a Jimmy Buffet CD now!,1
In my opinion this is a great family movie.,1
Plus the owl were really cute.,1
So was FREE WILLY and look how well that did.,1
Hoot is a film aimed squarely at families looking for a fun day at the cinema. The soundtrack by Jimmy Buffet is a perfect fit. A positive message from positive film. The young actors are spirited and refreshing.,1
"Other skits are better, though. ).",1
Roy Andersson directs. 0 out of 10. I saw this at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival.,1
"But whilst some may hail it upon an artistic throne, others will simply look on in confusion.",1
Larson! Go see yourself. I enjoy the National Anthem.,1
Running through them are various themes. Isn't everybody depressed?,1
Great movie. This movie is positive.,1
"A startling, beautiful, odd experience. You, the Living ( 2007 ) < br / > < br / > Mordant. Let me look it up. So corrosively funny. Exactly.",1
This film is brilliant and life affirming. Andersson gives us something else here. It is powerful stuff. At once alien and familiar. It has taken him seven years to make this.,1
"You can't really call Roy Andersson prolific, ( 6 films in 37 years ).",1
In other words Roy Andersson is back with a vengeance. A very warm and humanistic film. A work of visual splendor. There is no crowdpleasing. Minor Spoilers will follow.,1
"< br / > < br / > The world of'You, The Living'is also blighted by selfishness.",1
"< br / > < br / > Tomorrow is another day. It simply is, and you react.",1
"Hey! He makes Blade as deep a character as Michael Keaton made Batman. where the heck did Kris Kristofferson get acting talent? It had a script, too!",1
I really didn't see this one coming. The very depths of egotism are plumbed. And the web of egotism in this movie is truly hilarious.,1
There is no plot.,1
"With all the misery in the world, how can we not get drunk? "" < br / > < br / > There is also a hefty admixture of irony.",1
"A short review without any spoilers follows. Look out for the Flying House in the beginning folks! < br / > < br / > Well, sorry for this ranting praising review. My initial reaction is one of wonder and happiness.",1
"The Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson's latest film You, the Living is not easy to review.",1
It is difficult to try to catch it on TV all the time.,1
!,1
"Were it not for grinch ( Renfield ) it would be an ideal time. George soon meets a love interest in Susan ( Jane Kazmarek. ) That is why some people call it "" the children's holiday. """,1
Thanks.,1
"Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first.",1
Very cool as this is my home region. I'm sure it will be on again in 2007. I was surprised to John Denver!,1
Merry Christmas!,1
The choices were hard to make. I was there this year and it was wonderful. All 100 plus.,1
This is good news as it is one of my favourite films! com for all those who wish to own it as well as on video.,1
We love his movies.,1
Disney needs to see this film and put him to work. There wasn't much we didn't like about this one. They liked the music and all the extras on the DVD. He seemed so real. My kids love her!,1
The sets are also very authentic looking.,1
They are trapped into the barrier and dropped to sea. 000. This is a catastrophe movie set in London.,1
"< br / > < br / > Additional Info. < br / > < br / > Bad language : Some, strong.",1
I recommend this for anyone who is interested in military history.,1
Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. < br / > < br / > The film follows the course of the battle. World War II was the most graphic and bloody affairs to ever occur in world history.,1
"Yes it contains action scenes depicting bitter battles and terrible destruction. Describing Stalingrad as a war film may be a bit inaccurate. This portrayal adds another layer to the suffocating envelope of trapped hopelessness that pervades the film. The visceral storytelling and harsh images though make it something more than a war film, even more than an anti - war film.",1
"One of the best war films I have ever seen, if not the best.",1
It also helps that they're being played by well cast actors. It helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere. < br / > < br / > The way this story is told isn't however the best. The movie isn't always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague.,1
"No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.",1
This movie does that.,1
The plot of this film is ridiculous too. 7 out of 10 kids.,1
Take time to watch it!,1
Bloody marvelous. A pie.,1
"By not talking too much about it, and just referring the war and the POW's. How? Why do I say this? The NAZI's are all bad guys, I'm against them'( typical of German war movies ). This goes for all the ranks, and in the end you see von Paulus giving example.",1
Both will haunt me for rest of my life. This movie shares the cold with the book.,1
"< br / > < br / > This film is going to haunt me for a while. The Battle & Winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare but it also felt so real. < br / > < br / > 1942 : World War II is in full swing. A fateful move that ultimately dooms Nazi Germany to defeat. I just recently saw this movie in hopes of seeing an accurate portrayal of the bloodiest battle of the 20th Century. Just to think I came across this movie by luck, before I had never even heard of it. To make matters worse, the Russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the Germans.",1
Why not this one? Most other DVD'are multilingual. Everything is accurate.,1
"< br / > < br / > "" Stalingrad "" is such a gem. They do their duty and fight bravely. But the real horror is elsewhere. No. So, what's so special?",1
The film is about the battle of Stalingrad.,1
"Although filmed by Germans, "" Stalingrad "" is anything but a nationalistic apologetic film.",1
"The horror effects are extreme, terrifying, and unforgettable. The soundtrack is very effective and unique.",1
"He also told me some anecdotes, not all he told me was gloomy. They are doomed to die ; it is clear from the very beginning. And “ Stalingrad ” is an exception. Probably when the lieutenant chokes back his tears at seeing Kolya ’ s execution.",1
The love story : that wasn't a love story. Watch it as such. The fat cats weren't gonna go into Russia! Death is the ultimate end to any story.,1
"As a testament to the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the Eastern Front in the Second World War, it is a powerful one. This is a film that I keep coming back to, for a variety of reasons.",1
How far will Dave go to keep his secret?,1
Definite recommend it! I thought it was an excellent movie.,1
"Cole is believable and excellent in these roles. 8 / 10. A fictional delusion, apparently.",1
"Gary Cole is very effective as both Master Sgt. The pressure of her nagging him got to the point where he just wanted to get lost and away from her and the kids. Back at Jackson AFB outside of Austin Tex. But he should have sought professional David Bay & husband David Haywood. It didn't take long for Dave to find out that civilian life just doesn't appeal to him. David then calls Alyson, who only met him once, and makes a date with her.",1
It'a good rent.,1
Swayze is funny and rally does comedy pretty well! Diane Ladd plays Rita the con - artist mother of Jack Charles.,1
"It's worth the "" ride. """,1
"I enjoyed this movie, but it was far from a masterpiece. < br / > < br / > KEVIN : Ah, our first sound western, and John Wayne's first starring role. < br / > < br / > BIRTHS : Richard Harris, Harold Pinter, Robert Atkins. In 1930, we are seeing many "" firsts "" but few "" bests. "" It's Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail.",1
"Tyrone Power Sr. is the man leading the caravan, he is a rough and mean guy.",1
They all journey together to blaze a trail for how movies would be made. The framing is limited to about belt - high and up - - no face close - ups.,1
"No one said that in "" The Big Trail "" and I thought it would be a natural. By time the settlers got to California I was exhausted.",1
I first saw this film in video form. Subplots are few and simple.,1
"It has horror, action, and drama. Even for the eighties, this was an awesome film.",1
There is a sincere connection with nature.,1
Nothing is overstated or overplayed. < br / > < br / > The plot of revenge and romance is played well. I have never seen wagons that were so real!,1
"Quite an innovation but also something that really stretched the talents of the sound technicians! < br / > < br / > As for the acting, it was pretty good. My giving this film a score of 8 is relative to other feature - length films from 1930.",1
The horses and mules have to be lowered to the river level and the wagons let down by ropes and pulley.,1
"He nearly steals the whole picture. The wagons, the clothing, every single detail looks and feels right.",1
"Thanks to a recent DVD release we now get to see the widescreen version alongside the fullscreen that was shot simultaneously. He makes great use of the wider frame to show off the Western landscape at its most breathtaking. Very typical of Walsh are a number of shots towards the beginning, such as the one where a woman is chopping firewood. The extra width becomes just that extra.",1
One of the best westerns I have seen. 0 : 1 ratio ( in 1930! ).,1
i really liked this film.,1
"Something like : "" Is Killinggänget now taking off Nazism? "" The magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer. < br / > < br / > 2.",1
"I just recently bought "" The Big Trail "" { 1930 }. It's an awesome, amazing film. Well, you have only half the team here, but the entire Myth is present.",1
that subject ever filmed. < br / > < br / > It still takes my breath away.,1
And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! The text boards bringing the story along reinforced that impression I suppose.,1
And of course both films were done on location and show the expense in making them. No studio product here with a backlot western set.,1
"He fills the screen, every portion of it, with action. Slick cardsharp Ian Keith is a sophisticated bad guy. Walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use wide screen. Marguerite Churchill is fetching as a lovely Southern belle who slowly warms to the Duke's attentions.",1
I could smell the wet canvas. Each day is an agony. Bravo.,1
"( The other two are Fox Movietone Follies of 1929, completely lost, and Happy Days, which survives only in standard format. ) < br / > < br / > Why did wide film fail in 1930?",1
Not rated by the MPAA but contains nothing to offend.,1
To know that she performed a marvelous Lincoln Ctr. Amazing! She admits that she has never been happy. This is an extraordinary film musically. what were her disappointments? There is one segment in which she claims that she has played in every single town in Italy that has a stage!,1
"Apparently they had cut out a lot to fit it in to just 3, 5 hours. This movie must be exported to the rest of the world!",1
Very much so.,1
!,1
< br / > < br / > It's also about being true to yourself. I really liked this movie.,1
"Yes, this film is another remake. Mazar, the gossip girl, that shows no mercy for what she says and whom she says it to. Finally there's MIdler, who plays Leah Miller, a crazy eclectic but wise Hollywood agent. Then there's writer Alex who's a lesbian, with a lot of spunk, but knows her way with words. She has decisions to make that test her moral and ethic values.",1
"Yes, the casting decisions may seem strange, but they WORK. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and fully intend to go see again with my mother. Debra Messing was adorable, and Candice Bergen was fantastic. Women will understand.",1
Now this isn't a classic but it's not that bad. Naturally it WAS done. Messing is good too but she's not in this much. ! Her face seems unable to change expression!,1
"More broad satire? But it's drama, thankfully, and what drama!",1
He had a great time.,1
So I gave this chick flick a 9. The NYC scenes were nice to see. It won't disappoint. Candice Bergen is showing her age as is Carrie Fisher. I am a 58 year old man. Let's face it Meg looks much better with long hair.,1
I would not compare to it totally.,1
Most of the comments so far have nailed this one right on the head. Is the premise wildly original? The sharp dialog is effortlessly and effectively delivered by these pros.,1
"This is not an out - of - wedlock pregnancy, which would have been horrific by 1921 standards.",1
"Now we come to Flint Hill, New Hampshire in the present ( 1921 ). Apparently, God told him this personally. < br / > < br / > SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD.",1
"In some ways a little like Short Cuts, but totally different, at the same time.",1
He is mostly inspired by the great M. Davis and T. Monk.,1
"< br / > < br / > "" 00 Schneider "" is, in my opinion, Helge's best movie. The catch? While his stage performances already are eccentric, his movie works are simply hilariously outrageous.",1
"), and very unusual in days of early silent cinema. THis is a bewildering, Absurdist Short. Although the image is pared down, there is an obvious logic here. However, he is stopped by the sweep, all in black because of his work. Is this class war?",1
"I absolutely, positively loved the movie. Everyone also talks about how mature he is.",1
"Pure and magical. < br / > < br / > Anyway, great film.",1
"This should not detract you from watching this fun film of growth, hope, and friendship. Miyazaki has claimed that "" this is my last movie "" for many years but shortly after Spirited Away, he gave us Howl's Moving Castle. Although not lonely, Sosuke is just like any other curious boy who likes adventure and allure of the sea. < br / > < br / > I managed to watch the subtitled version of this last year and was pleased by the story and plot. Ponyo is no exception. That coupled with his characteristic use of character development and often using girls and women as main characters.",1
< br / > < br / > Miyazaki has indeed another masterpiece. Ponyo is not too difficult to understand or comprehend. It's just that good.,1
( The Radish Spirit. The movie did seem to end abruptly though. The story is simple but fairly well written and played out. Other than that the movie was great and I highly recommend it.,1
Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo is such a film.,1
"Once again, all I can say is "" Wow! "" Does everything make sense? What a wonderfully creative and unique film experience that was! Good choices all.",1
"He cuts his hand when breaking the jar open to free the little goldfish. com ). Making her a loving, sensible, modern mother both to Sosuke and Ponyo.",1
She is a large goldfish who already looks like a pretty red - haired girl.,1
He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker. < br / > < br / > ( No.,1
"It's a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable, aiming for charm instead of conflict. The effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to American audiences and Disney is getting close. When she does, she quickly befriends a young boy named Sosuke.",1
"They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with. Ponyo brings everyone back to that world. Okay, you don't need to read any further now.",1
"Other than that, there are some great comments by Londoners and excellent shots.",1
"An age bracket much younger than that of Tonarino Totoro ( My Neighbor Totoro ). And I believe the most simple way I can answer to this, is that it's a movie for a much, much younger age bracket.",1
"With Sosuke'help, Ponyo must pass a test to lift this curse and completely become a human.",1
The story is simple and cute.,1
I loved it!,1
"The problem is that the story doesn't stay afloat to satisfy anyone eager for another engrossing, in - depth plot. He separates the pair and tries to talk Ponyo into staying underwater with him. As mentioned, it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as TOTORO and KIKI. Don't get me wrong, PONYO is not a bad movie by any means.",1
It is of the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. It did and he named it'Ponyo'( Yuria Nara ).,1
Don't miss it.,1
"If you've never seen a Miyazaki film before, then it will probably confuse the heck out of you. There was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for the backgrounds. But, because it is so hard to describe ( and others have already done so ), I won't even go there.",1
"I have recently watched this film, and have decided to comment on it. can Ponyo really stay with Sousuke forever?",1
"Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "" Gake No Ue No Ponyo "" ( Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea ) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.",1
but that makes them all more endearing. The movie's secret is brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters.,1
"Too often our judgement are impeded by our own limitations of cinematic and cultural standing. Ponyo may at times feel so unique and fresh, it may feel alien like. < br / > < br / > In terms of audience age range, it is probably pre Totoro.",1
Saying anything more would be to spoil the fun.,1
"However, two elements were lacking : a deep story and dramaturgy.",1
"I gave the movie a ten out of ten rating. The boy names fish Ponyo. Joe Hisaishi, once again, provided outstanding musical support. Miyazaki, who shows no fear of having a busy scene, has outdone himself.",1
So I decided to watch it.,1
i believed it. the acting was top class.,1
Sometimes all we want to do is end the suffering. The acting is superb throughout with special mention to a few.,1
Leland is very perceptive.,1
My vote is seven.,1
good movie. recommend as a buy or at least a rent.,1
"His motive of committing murder is left incompletely explained, and it makes viewers think.",1
"The supporting cast is terrific as well. I highly recommend it. He is intelligent, yettoic.",1
!,1
"But the real flavorings come out when we immerse ourselves in the Pollards, the family of the retarded child. Spacey. The issue is not whether he did it or not Leland admits to it, straight away but rather, why. Even Chris Klein these < br / > < br / > And Leland features the required indie group of screwed - up people. And the movie takes a good look at what goes into those choices, and the consequences of them.",1
The ensemble cast does good work under Mr. Hoge's direction.,1
"< br / > < br / > Great movie. See it for yourself. I am still lost in thought, attempting to answer my many questions from the film.",1
Chris Klein gives his best performance to date. High recommended.,1
"The movie personifies Leland in a way. Nothing it solid, it's not definite, it's about what the individual viewer takes out of it.",1
"Don Cheadle was also fantastic. The film presented an interesting view on life and death. It is a film that reckless of whether or not you like it, you should see it. I was pleasantly surprised.",1
I am no Ebert.,1
"They want blame to be cast and resolved. I was looking at the external reviews ( Ebert, etc. ) This irritates many, I am sure. There is a whole lot more to what happened then what is on the surface. Well, that status - quo theme is kind of what the movie is parodying. Perhaps there is no simple question to be answered here? I strongly believe people should view this film, with an open mind.",1
This is simply not a black - and - white movie.,1
"But if you do watch it... you just might find something yourself. I read only the plot premise and became intrigued. I'd suggest skipping this one. < br / > < br / > In short, it is a well acted, well directed movie. to say the least.",1
"When pressured with the question'Why? 'There is a why, but we don't find out about it until the end. Leland notices things that people tend to ignore. 'he doesn't have an answer. All the problems depicted in story are very real. < br / > < br / > In this movie, there is no bad guy. There is no one you can blame for anything that happens. Instead, we sit back, relax, and watch this boy's life unfold throughout the corse of the movie. Maybe this is something that just happened. His father lives in Europe and doesn't really care much about his son.",1
It'll be up to his loyal (.. and startlingly intelligent ) and fast - thinking dog Gromit to save the day.,1
< br / > < br / > On the negative side this film is a little on the long side.,1
Greatly recommended! And suddenly no vegetable in town is safe!,1
"For the record, "" The Curse of Were - Rabbit "" took five years to make.",1
"I was extremely amused to read some of the bad reviews on this movie. are normal themes, no harm done. ?",1
"In fact, she's much better. I cried. Anywhere But Here is my favorite drama.",1
"But this one caught me by surprise. Going into this movie, I was a bit cautious. Give it a shot!",1
"It's fresh, funny and amazingly clever. First, the voice actors do a great job.",1
"In this case they've invented a machine that can capture all of the bunnies that are eating up the crops all over a quiet English village. Granted, the Aardman guys ( Nick Park and Steve Box ) have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material.",1
Maybe. Too young. Too many sex references? Any film that takes 5 (! ) Who can ask for more?,1
"It's a hoot, and great for the whole family!",1
!,1
"Hooray, Wallace and Gromit. Wallace and Gromit has not changed. The animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful. But Wallace had an idea. Well done, Nick.",1
"< br / > < br / > The best part of the film, however, is the clever comedy woven throughout. This was very good, except for two things which I'll mention at the end. The color was magnificent, too.",1
"< br / > < br / > Wallace and Gromit are very English. Curse of Were Rabbit is witty, English, and intelligent.",1
Crackin'Good Entertainment!,1
"You can imagine that inside Park is the mind of Wallace. This is what shows in his movies, and in through his most beloved characters. The first is subtlety and observation, the flagship of which is the character of Gromit.",1
It goes way above their heads. It was amazing. I wont say anymore.,1
This one is jolly good.,1
"Vintage Aardman! < br / > < br / > The characters are crisp and hilarious. Helena Bonham Carter was terrific as the lovely Lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. ). THE MOON!!! """,1
This film will be a delight for both kids and parents.,1
"Charming, clever, fun and well made, what'not to enjoy?",1
Enjoy! This is where W & G come in. It really completes ride. < br / > < br / > It's a very funny and colorful story.,1
"Here, you are already able to know the two main characters. I saw it at a German press screening. Chicken Run "" had the more convenient, but also more "" storytelling "" plot. From my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year.",1
"But are they being properly released? Imagine that, a real girl in a movie, whatever next? There he falls in love with alluring Macdonald lass, and she reciprocates the affection.",1
"< br / > < br / > Intelligent but undemanding, it is good for quiet evening in. They are given the task of building a rocket post box that will enable the islanders to communicate with the mainland.",1
"Worse yet, there's a pernicious Satanic cult that's been abducting little children for their own diabolical purposes. Nice eerily ambiguous ending, too.",1
"On the back of the pack it read, in so many words.... plant these seeds at midnight. ! on the front.",1
And I think that is great. < br / > < br / > A good film.,1
What an actor!,1
"It worked in this case, too.",1
Jaime Mendoza - Navas'music is subtly sinister and gives it that extra sense of eeriness.,1
< br / > < br / > The story is not that good. A 7. Still this movie does work.,1
"Beautifully shot film, too.",1
"offer solid support as the no - nonsense sheriff and his comic - strip aficionado assistant. ; luckily, the DVD has been re - issued at bargain - price - and I'm sure glad I picked it up!",1
Seems like the children have been disappearing. 8 out of 10.,1
The Acting is excellent!. Strother Martin is fantastic here!,1
It is a truly humbling experience.,1
I couldn't'have been more wrong. Given the IMDb rating of 4. The unknown helps make for a far creepier atmosphere than most similar films. We see all five men at once each doing their own thing as in real life. The ending is effective with its surreal imagery. Not here.,1
Absolutely recommended. What is the cause of hysteria?,1
Man!,1
"Something of which the same cannot be said about today's cartoons, sadly.",1
dk with'Himmelskibet'to get more info.,1
Guess which one cracks. Even the Martians.,1
But I can't leave! It'A GOOD SHOW.,1
< br / > < br / > The show is not perfect. As for Mencia being offensive he is only speaking his mind. I find nothing wrong with that.,1
Susan Sarandon. She made this movie for me.,1
Gary Cooper is a cool headed guy.,1
"7 / 10 Dallas stars Gary Cooper, Ruth Roman, Steve Cochran, Barbara Payton & Raymond Massey. It's true he isn't really asked to do anything more than be a laconic dude on a mission.",1
IMAGINARY HEROES is one fine little film! Highly Recommended.,1
"And, I'm glad I did.",1
He was in Shaft and he stole the movie. Halle Berry even produced it. Markerson who plays Nanny is also very good. Where is this mans Oscar? He is a chameleon never the same. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I never seen him play a bad part yet.,1
Downplayed just perfectly and understated.,1
"Ms Weaver must be dancing a jig. Still, a very watchable film. Ben's mourning was much more clear. Did his mom think so too? Sorry. She was born in 1949.",1
!,1
A big bravo to all involved.,1
"Of note is Emile Hirsch who would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding "" Into The Wild "". Here, the writing cannot measure with that of American Beauty.",1
"This seems to have been the goal of director / writer Dan Harris. So what is Ben looking at? But "" Imaginary Heroes "" is a good effort. The script could have been sharper.",1
Michelle Williams'older sister Penny is underwritten and could easily be taken out of the film.,1
Everyone who loves him hurts him. The film focuses on Tim.,1
It's not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious films to explore. Each of the remaining family members copes with the tragedy in his or her own way. Far from it.,1
).,1
I never thought I'd watch it... nevermind like it. 110 minutes later I am still interested. How could this be?,1
I am sure however that we will hear a lot about Dan Harris in the coming years.,1
The cast was amazing. I was riveted. It should be seen.,1
Wow.,1
Well done! < br / > < br / > Clearly 10. I would be surprised if others didn't recognize it as such. This film is a powerful commentary on family life in North America today.,1
"Very realistic. The movie is really in my head right now - - saw it this morning. Will try to see it again, time allowing.",1
"Heavy film! I thought the acting was excellent, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hih.",1
"In this case, the censors seem to have exercised extremely poor judgment.",1
Recommended.,1
Thank you NFB for letting it be made. I love it.,1
"In this one, a couple are playing Scrabble. before catching her husband looking at her side.",1
She sees that the mother doesn't get it.,1
The film deserves kudos for both being unique as well as very funny.,1
... the world may never know.,1
< br / > < br / > It is flawless... in every way.,1
"And did I mention it was nominated for an Academy Award? Darn tootin '. Richard Condie is a Canadian marvel, and one that should be shared with the world.",1
Sheffield. Blind to an inevitable apocalypse.,1
this film makes you think.,1
"Not great, but Anywhere But Here is definitely worth a look.",1
"What makes him so appealing is his humanity and likability. His humour is like barbed wire, and yet it is cathartic.",1
"But, it never got boring. Overall I give it a 7 / 10. ( Big Surprise! )",1
Great Film! Our election process is unclothed and dismal.,1
It felt like I was watching two movies.,1
Not every line in a comedy is funny.,1
Rent it if that doesn t match you. I enjoyed it and thanks to IMDb.,1
Let us debate it.,1
Chick Flick? Many times.... You bet!,1
Leaves a lot for thought. Overall I enjoyed it.,1
"But shockingly we wins and makes a mockery of the office. """,1
The movie has heart.,1
I encourage anyone who thinks our process is fine to go see this film. So much of what we see and hear in regards to any election is such a joke.,1
Robin Williams is in top form.,1

So is Letterman.,1
Nope. And the same goes with Dave. I'd rather they had Norm McDonald play the part. She basically steals the film.,1
< br / > < br / > They could have done more with Johnny's role in all this. Letterman and Leno themselves had objections.,1
"The hard and simple truth is exactly as one NBC exec stated in the film "" Jay Leno is the funniest man in America. "" And David Letterman is not. Once you realize this, then much of the machinations in the film become irrelevant.",1
As if.,1
< br / > < br / > The performances are also very good.,1
The book is certainly stronger than the movie. Watching him really was like watching Letterman.,1
This was Johnny Carson! I respectfully disagree.,1
"I only have two minor quips about the film, as subtle as they are. Two - the distribution of the foul language.",1

Lots of special moments.,1
See movie - it is GREAT!,1
"The screen play was excellent, as well the supporting cast. I subscribe to Dish. an angel? For you who have seen film, you know what I'm talking about.",1
Eastwood and Malkovich are superb.,1
Editing and cinematography are good.,1
9 / 10.,1
This is a Hollywood film.,1
"With Eastwood, if he lifts an eyebrow by a millimeter, watch out! What a good'un. This film was made when both Eastwood and Malkovich were at their peak. Of course, he is the master of the super - cool.",1
I don't think it was the script writer's fault. 7 / 10 Bethany Cox.,1
Pretty much as you'd expect but well - handled.,1
Don't miss! This one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller! It has Rene Russo as the'love interest.,1
The characters he plays are simplistic and one - dimensional. Malkovich is a tremendous actor and incredibly versatile. < br / > < br / > Clint Eastwood is no one special me.,1
Wow!,1
It felt like a true story.,1
"Yet, it's not an excellent movie. The stakes?",1
And after a while what Malkovich says and does causes Clint to get real personal. He calls Eastwood throughout the film and taunts him.,1
Now there is an intense actor! This is one more example.,1
They really look like mother daughter. The movie is incredible.,1
).,1
"As for Leary ( John Malkovich ), he was a sick man who loved to toy with Frank by phone. He looked good in the tuxedo he wore near the end of the film, though.",1
He's tested again halfway through this movie. He gives pompous speeches Who could?,1
"But one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious. It's a race against time to save Pres from a chameleon - like enemy who can get to anyone. Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat on the President by a "" wacko "". My favorite Secret Service movie and as good a nail biter as any. Who will die?",1
Top notch movie. Clint Eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993.,1
!,1
He questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Wolfgang Peterson ratchet up the tension and we feel every turn. In The Line of Fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse.,1
It would be a shame if they were overlooked. I absolutely LOVED the film! Portman was also excellent as Ann.,1
"He even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth. It's fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it! Why? - It's GOOD!",1
"Be careful though, you might die laughing. And I'm not joking!",1
"I was cringing away from the TV during most of the scenes. Dee Snider is very scary as Captain Howdy - - his attack scenes are not pleasant. But a lynch mop ( led, amusingly, by Robert Englund ) attack him and hang him. Four years later he's released... totally cured. < br / > < br / > The acting varies. He poses as a teenage boy and invites other teens over his house to party. I give it a 7. He captures the daughter of cop Mike Gage ( Kevin Gage ).

"I was pleasantly surprised. < br / > < br / > Personally, I enjoyed the film.",1
"More importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over Portman'portrayal of the daughter. The question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot, who changes? I am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also.",1
She is SMOKIN'hot and a great little actress to boot! The others are clearly not in her league.,1
A man named Jerry comes into possession of an ancient Aztec doll. 8 out of 10.,1

Finally, he executes the near miraculous - he gets Gracie to shut up. Three zany couples, all SIX OF A KIND, become entangled in a madcap search for stolen bank loot. From beginning to end, they are a delight. Her heart was obviously made of solid gold. At times in the film she tends to go a bit over the top, but it's difficult to dislike her.",1
"8 / 10 It is very touching, I was moved by the movie.",1
"They get Burns and Allen and a monster of a dog. < br / > < br / > A real classic comedy from the thirties, not to missed. But back then we didn't delve into such things.",1
GO WEST with the Marx Brothers had Buster Keaton write the script as a gag man. Fields ( usually a single act ) was paired three times with Skipworth ( TILLY AND GUS and IF I HAD A MILLION were other two times ).,1
You won't be able to stop watching if you start.,1

This series is vastly underrated.,1

Irene Dunn is stellar in her role.,1
I really felt the movie was ahead of its time.,1

Yikes! Some verbal barbs leveled at him again would not get past Code office if made later. It would have played like the VIRGINIA WOLF of 1932.,1

He convinces a famous violinist to sponsor the school. < br / > < br / > The acting is a study in contrasts.,1
"Such a figure is Mark Borchardt, the subject of this hilarious documentary which chronicles his attempt to make a pair of movies over many many years. David Lynch shot his first film,'Erasurehead ', over several years, adding new scenes each time he managed to raise a little bit more cash. But $ 30, 000 is still a hell of a lot of money to raise if you work as a cleaner in a cemetery.",1
He is so confident he can't fail that failure is guaranteed. The humor comes from Borchardt's Ed Wood - style belief in his own genius.,1
"Let's face it, lot's of bad movies are made all the time. Chicago Rules. American Movie captures the raw spirit of independent film - making. Rugged Individualism materializes in every art form. It's okay!... Jesus told me so!!! "" Man, these people are hilarious.",1

I rented this movie for two reasons.,1
No I'm not kidding. < br / > < br / > And what a great subject he chooses. This may actually the finest film of 1999.,1
"I enjoyed this one, because I can relate to it. < br / > < br / > Mark hasn't faced up to that reality as yet, and so, in that sense, he is a retarded adolescent. I realized that being a struggling filmmaker was, in all likelihood, not going to feed my family. Yet he trudges on, much like Ed Wood, apparently without any semblance of a clue. That is what an mature, responsible adult does. And man, what odds there are! But then, miraculously, I got married, and had kids. For this reason, there is a hopelessness about him.",1

Very good film. Walking the night is scary business.,1
High recommended.,1
"There, he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of Japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church. This is typical for He does not hit him. Comparing this movie to other World War 2 movies, it is not typical at all. But since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed, he begins a long walk. This makes Tamura think and even more scared than he already is. All he has on him is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes.",1
"This isn't to say its not horrifying, it is at times, but its also darkly comic. Its a jarring sensation. How could it not be? This is a bleak tale of the destruction of the Japanese soldier.",1
"But at his best, he was as good as any Japanese film maker at the time. No really, its seriously hell.",1

"Two of the populous comes back to get some supplies, and Tamura sneaks up on them. < br / > < br / > In film Tamura just wants to get some medical care. Kon Ichikawa had lived through world war two, and saw what its effects it had on his people in Japan. It's a film about the men in this war, or perhaps more universally in wars in general, who lose their humanity. It makes Stone's Platoon look like a picnic : at least they had certain things, like food, after all.",1
See it if you can get it.,1
"He takes the boots, replacing them with his old ones. Fires on The Plain ( 1959 ) * * * * < br / > < br / > You don't see films like this anymore.",1

"Ichikawa, reveals what the Germans called the "" war life, "" the plight of the common soldier. War is horrifying, bloody, destructive.",1
"The loser is simply removed from existence. It is in that shabby excuse of a hospital that one of the most harrowing scenes of the film takes place. Nobi cuts deep, it's ugly, tenebrous and bleak as few things ever committed on celluloid will ever be. Which it does. War and survival.",1
"Every American who thinks he or she understands World War Two should see this movie. They euphemistically refer to human flesh as "" monkey meat. """,1
Surely one of the film's major assets is the stunning cinematography of the unforgiving and desolate muddy landscape.,1
This is one of the most anti - traditional war movies about was I have seen. Horrible but great. You simply couldn't have made a better film of this type.,1
The atmosphere is very melancholic.,1
The camera work is pretty solid.,1

"Yet, all of the supporting actors fit well with his character.",1
it added to the fear factor. in their boat.,1
Grace Pat & Adam end up stranded on a tree in the swamp with Pat hanging on for dear life on the capsized boat. The ending with the crocodile vrs human confrontation was about the weakest and most unrealistic part in the film.,1
"It really wasn't. The plot is actually somewhat original, and will definitely keep you intrigued with it. Also again I just don't think some of the characters actions were realistic.",1
I give it a 7.,1
This is as much a crocodile film as OPEN WATER was a shark film.,1
That is true faith. She is 81 yrs. Scary.,1
The basic plot of this film has already been detailed in several other comments so I won't bother. Croc's will spin around and around to dismember and drown the prey. That happened to the first 3 victims but not to Lee. She ends up with her hand in his ( her? ) This is essentially art for art's sake.,1

Very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it. < br / > < br / > I had tears in my eyes at the end.,1
She may prove to be quite discovery. It not about the characters so much as about the human condition.,1
No. Gore hounds beware... this is not your movie. This little nail bitter has very little blood and guts.,1
"I just saw the movie, through Netflix.",1
"What we get is a patient survival tale than just a bloody, all - out creature feature onslaught. Smiling would be the last thing on my mind. The way the night sequence is executed is immensely chilling and pulsating. Sure some moments felt unlikely, but never does it get in the way or distract. In certain patches the notch goes up, with pressure induced suspense and startling images.",1
High recommended.,1
My vote is seven.,1
This is a very appealing movie. You can not tell me that doesn't freak you out just a little.,1
The situation they were in was quite terrifying and I really felt nervous for them.,1

What the Democrats didn't send troops to Vietnam? For the Canadian bashing I will leave that to Bill O'Reilly. Concentrate on the issue of finite resources. I will give the documentary props for trying to present a balanced point of view about the depletion of oil.,1
They will thank you eventually.,1
"The clips, especially those from the 1950's, seemed a tad unnecessary to me. It questions the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise. We are given little information as to how this date was calculated. This is also one of the reasons Salton Sea is such a wonderful documentary.",1

"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence.",1
"Being that Oz is mostly black, the Homeboys have the most soldiers of any gang inside. < br / > < br / > There are about 10 gangs shown on Oz. As a group they are not so much anti - white but rather anti - injustice. In this group, one character who is acted terrifically is Simon Adebisi.",1
He Oz is the TV show which is intensive non - stop adrenaline. Hes also very physically quite large and solid. These two reasons are why he is one of the most powerful inmates inside of Oz.,1
"There are twists and turns all the way till the season finally. Don't be a fool, go watch Oz. This show is easily one of best shows on television.",1
What a great show!,1
"The transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is amazing. However, the character that MADE Oz OZ was CHRIS KELLER ( played by Christopher Meloni ). * Karl Metzger ( guard ) gets killed and no one investigates.",1
Why?,1
"Hence, everyone had a favourite. When Animal appeared behind a drum kit and attempted to eat a cymbal, I knew I had found one of mine. A great light in the world went out the day Jim Henson died.",1
Why? I admit that I almost gave up on watching TV shows.,1
OZ is an old TV series released by HBO.,1
And now i just seen the episode 3 of season 6. But still a golden glove. It is a really good series!,1
"This is a hard show to watch. I love seasons 2 - 4. People get screwed over, raped, tortured and die like flies. Oz is a brave show. I do recommend it.",1
Guess I gotta sell it all online. < br / > < br / > I give it a 10.,1

Sopranoes sucks huge compared to OZ.,1
No contest.,1
"Oz is a great series, one of televisions underrated shows.",1
"It tells the story of confrontation, cruelty, violence, hate and survival at any cost. Oz is set in Oswald State Correctional Facility.",1
"I didn't see that as the case here. He is an amazing actor. Enter Sandra Bullock's character, who it seems most people didn't particularly appreciate.",1
You are starting to get to know the people involved. The killers are two high school kids. I liked this movie. We all know this crime will not turn out perfect. < br / > < br / > The story is told in a nice way.,1
That'what I intend to do! Thank you Jim Henson.,1

There are no shortcuts there. '. imdb. Just don't use this as required viewing for detective exams.,1
This whole concept is really hard to believe. He had no get - up and go. Loved the acting of all but Sam. Just to play and jostle with the cops? Hmmm.,1
"That said, the cast is great. Assigned to help her is fellow officer, Sam ( Ben Chaplin ).",1
"But, I digress. It'still an entertaining movie, nonetheless. But Sandra has a feeling that all is not as it appears to be. Enter Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case.",1
Two teens decide to commit a perfect murder. All others are pretty flat. I gathered from the ads that it was a thriller. It'll cost you eight bucks to find out.,1
Cassie Mayweather. Sandra Bullock plays the heroic thorn in the way of their plans as Det.,1
"The movie is not so much a thriller, but rather a character study of Cassie. There are interesting turns in "" Numbers "". Everything is done very competently. However, it is just not inspired work. Though Chaplin does the bewilderment thing very admirably. Bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character.",1

"< br / > < br / > Available YouTube. Porky is a nice edition to the episode, though it was not vital for him to be there. I also liked the style of animation used - and the theme of the episode. I liked this short quite a lot ( despite the other reviewers on here ).",1
"All sense of subtlety, so effectively conveyed hitherto, is lost, as the implicit point is heavily and noisily made. Your distance from ever fully sympathizing with any one true character mirrors the dormant'difference'that so dooms the central relationship. < br / > < br / The political point is heavily over - egged by this bombastic, rather dingily operatic ending. Miles and Shaw are wonderfully subtle, and we see more in their'less'; never once are these actorly, showy performances. Agit - prop surely has no place in this sort of delicate period drama.",1

I enjoyed THE MUPPET MOVIE very much.,1
"< br / > < br / > NO objectionable material a good family film. He begins to find out that she is not the same. I was blown away when I saw "" The Best Years of Our Lives "".",1
His craftsmanship is unsurpass.,1
true classic!,1
"So many great talents were utilized in "" The Best Years of Out Lives "", the result has to be somewhat miraculous.",1
With a perfect cast and great dialogue Goldwin and Wyler produced a movie that will forever be the template for any other returning home movie. Also later in the film we find out that their marriage has not always been a bed of roses. < br / > < br / > Wyler is a director whose force lies in being true to his work without feeling the need to boast.,1
Very well done.,1
And they paid mine as well. What a statistic we have to live with. ) They never should be. I oppose all war. She had seen a great deal of action.,1
The pleasant song score comes courtesy of Paul Williams who also makes an appearance as the resident pianist at El Sleazo '.,1
"WWII veterans return home and find it hard to adjust to civilian life. Despite its near three - hour length, it does not drag for a minute.",1
The cast was uniformly wonderful. The theme of human desires is timeless. I disagree.,1

A simply brilliant film.,1
Because I Only Watched It At Mrs Kelly's Friend's House. It Was So Cool. The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.,1
* * * * * < br / > < br / > I'm very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI.,1
I won't get off track and name 3 or 4 better. The movie meanders ; there is little tension.,1
"MUA has a leisurely pace but have patience, the reward is coming. My Uncle Antoine is much, much greater than the sum of it's parts.",1
Definite check this one out.,1
"Go watch action / adventure / romance / comedies to be amused. It will leave lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived in - or visited - Québec. < br / > < br / > Mon Oncle Antoine is - in every sense of the word - unforgettable. A classic. Nevertheless, it is a remarkable piece of cinema which is as timeless as a rare work of art.",1
"Lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the U. S., and Stewart seems determined to keep up appearances. A poor box - office performer when released, this film has been largely forgotten today.",1
It well edited with flashbacks over Lindeberghs life.,1
to make an enjoyable film that has aged better than most films from that time.,1
"I saw it at the drive - ins here in California in the late 70s. If I rate the film maybe a bit high, you can blame it on sentiment. Of course. < br / > < br / > This is the best movie with Muppets by a long shot.",1
"Well, there is.",1
And the look of the plane itself was great.,1
"Yet, I can only just its impact on me. What is it below?",1
Very good!,1
"< br / > < br / > But never mind that. It's an impressive film. And he can't sleep. That landing at Le What's the alternative. Observing the unities? ( Even in 1927, money talked. ) The atheist Stewart is saved twice - - once by a fly and once by God.",1
What run!,1
"7 / 10 This is the story of that flight "".",1
"I wouldn't have wanted to see the flight shortened at all. The oppressive need for sleep and the drone and surrounding loneliness is part of the story. This is a great story. For those of us who actually fly, flight can be hours of boredom punctuated by moments of terror. ). I hope they make it on DVD soon so I can replace my stolen version! < br / > < br / > This movie is not for everybody but it certainly is for me.",1
"Overall, it is just plain good.",1
< br / > < br / > See it.,1
This is classic movie that should be viewed by all. Well done throughout.,1
Maybe because they thought they knew the story or that it was just going to be one guy stuck in a cockpit for two hours. In 1982 it was Blade Runner. Even the typically muted and problematic WarnerColor adds to the film rather than detracts from it.,1

It was now up to Cena & Batista. < br / > < br / > FIRST MATCH - SHAWN MICHAELS VS.,1
Probably the best Royal Rumble in years. < br / > < br / > Not a bad PPV at all.,1
Randy Orton vs HHH. Not a good match.,1
"It has its usual highs and lows, and i loved the ending, in particular the Vince McMahon entrance. It can hardly be regarded as classic wrestling match. Typical Undertaker fare. Its also a casket match. Two from Smackdown and two from Raw. It's hard to sum up without giving away the winner. This is a match i'd recommend watching. < br / > < br / > Shawn Michaels and Edge open up for Raw. Watch if you're a fan. Raw's match is a pretty dull and boring affair, which is a pity as i'm a fan of both guys involved.",1
< br / > < br / > Randy Orton vs.,1
< br / > < br / > 4. Edge Vs Shawn Michaels < br / > < br / > 7. A respectable royal rumble event < br / > < br / > 1.,1
There was no shortage of contenders. Batista? Edge? Back and fourth all the way until Edge got the pinfall. It was entertaining.,1

Ooh la la!,1

It's a Bond spoof without falling into the mad scientist / Ken Adam sets or funny gadgets routine. Throughly recommended.,1
That's how I'd sum it up! He's the spy with number 117 attached to him.,1
"If taken in the spirit of a parody of Bond - esquire films, it's truly superior. All in all, I thought this film excellent.",1
"Seems like M. Hazanavicius is back! He just looks like an unfrozen Lino Ventura, with something like 40 pounds less, which is perfect for the role. It all starts in 1955 with a British spy disappearing while tracking a Russian cargo full of weapons in Suez.",1
"The women and the music are beautiful. Surprisingly, it's neither.",1
"I mean they are all very funny. I can't wait to see it. The Muppet's are very, very funny. I have always loved The Muppets.",1
Some references to today's world are very subtle. Wait and see. I just hope this movie is released on DVD in the US...,1
Wonder how it will be appreciated in US?,1
This film features a few beautiful crowd scenes of dozens of puppet frogs.,1
"They appeal to their god, Jupiter, to give them a king.",1
That alone should tell you what to expect here!,1
"Irritated, Jupiter sends them a stork. - - was a dark political satire variously known as "" Frogland "" or "" The Frogs Who Wanted a King. """,1
"However, in the end, he cannot abide by his selfish decision.",1
I missed the beginning of the film. The moral ramifications are staggering. Be it mental or physical.,1
"Her untimely death, in a car accident, made this Ms. Shepitko's final film, unfortunately. Their allegorical performances, under Shepitko's sharp direction, provide a memorable and thought - provoking take on a familiar story.",1
Shepitko pities Ryback as the Bible pities Judas. Is he wrong to do so?,1
"Or, even worse, watch the Italian war movies.",1
"Fantastic Russian WWII movie. It was probably not the choice, but the film is framed 1. It's also dense in its symbolism. It's not quite fair. 33 : 1, which gives the film a sense of claustrophobia.",1
"< br / > < br / > For me, the religiosity isn't overt. This is a movie that will mark you for life. And final scene is a bit ambiguous.",1
The second half of the film is filled with moral dilemmas. That has now changed thanks to the folks at Criterion. The Ascent ( 1977 ) < br / > < br / > Larisa Shepitko is a name very few are familiar with.,1
Its just too emotionally strenuous.,1
"What Russian soldiers are left hide under cover of forests, but are forced to send food expeditions to neighboring farms. ! Everything is reduced to a matter of survival.",1
"Larisa Shepitko's last film is one of the most beautiful war films in cinema history. In captivity, the attitude of the two men toward their fate differs greatly. The Ascent deserves a second watching, as well as a third, and a tenth.",1

I love foreign films and this is among the best.,1
? Only Croft has come close to Hensen's genius with puppets.,1
"See this movie, it will warm your heart.",1
I recommend movie very much. See it!,1
"But its always the French that seem to show us how effortless this all is! The film isn't a preachy morality tale, but a wonderful story that will keep you hooked until the last.",1
Highly enjoyable.,1
It moves along at a great pace and is truly enjoyable.,1
Leaving plenty of corpses in it's wake.,1
Also confusing is going from present to past. Mary Steenburgen does the best job of the cast.,1
Even her son can see thru the bastard. Still a good show and i rate it B +.,1
"'Tis indeed what movies are made of. Really, I feel like it's quite simple. Full of love I suppose you might say. ! A zest. The cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance. Who doesn't love the muppets?",1
But the segregation - integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at Nanny's boarding house. I always felt that Ms. Merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills.,1
I felt that Ashton did a great job in the Butterfly Effect. < br / > < br / > Definite a movie that could've been seen on DVD. Some of the scenes were just not believable and didn't have enough story line support.,1
"So it is not recommended to judge of this movie, just by itself.",1
"It's simply a treat to watch, and it's almost amazing considering that it was a made - for - TV film.",1
"I love the way his present situation reflects his flashbacks. Law, but don't do well in a costume drama.",1
"The England scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels, elements of which occasionally spill over into the real world.",1
"But the film has all the book sections within one long voyage. And I had to start it again as I began reading about this film. However, I think it will bring many readers to the book. Some roles were exemplary. It becomes a natural part of this story.",1
I was riveted to it!,1
"Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver. Mary, despite strong fantasy element in the story, is a very believable character.",1
"Children can read it. Liliputians. Gulliver's travels criticizes everything. Giants too, some of us may recall. < br / > < br / > This movie remembers, however.",1
And have you heard voices?,1
"A rare treat cinematography and direction. It is a remarkable performance by a man most known for his role in Cheers, a TV comedy sitcom.",1
"The frame - story has a theme about absent fathers that many children will relate to. Lucky kiddies! I hate special effects, but here they are used to carry the story forward instead of just dazzling us. < br / > < br / > The same applies to this movie.",1
"Shame. Have a good one! George, thinking it has developed the power of speech, drops the gnome in shock!",1
Riegart is juuuust right. Drag queens would kill for the glitz and glamour on display here.,1
But I LOVED this.,1
But I love Bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this. and I for one think that is a good thing. I've just never been a Rosalind Russell fan although the original was my favorite RR movie.,1
was loosely based.,1
"Fabulous. < br / > < br / > This interpretation is, for me, magical.",1

And it certainly is worth seeing.,1
I must tell you the truth.,1

Even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked. THE D. I. Great stuff!,1
"Brilliant. In many ways, the perfect movie.",1

"Excellent! Also, the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language ( though made easier here with the great stalwart Anna Massey ). There's even a nice little cameo role for the apparently famous Czech musician and actor ( and Kevin Kline lookalike ) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays on the piano the title theme song, Dark Blue Sky.",1
"But if you like happy ends, DBW is not for you. Movie is half in English and some actors are Britons. It's first big - screen movie about Czechoslovak WWII soldiers since "" Nebesti jezdci "" ( 1968 ). But greatest thing about this movie is it's pure existence.",1
Highly recommended. Finally they fight gallantly in the Battle of Britain.,1
"The movie starts with a little black humour, and then gets started. It's horror, but you can't feel but sympathy for the little mute. But this movie doesn't let you go. Everything becomes simple and basic, life is without nonsense. < br / > < br / > Well, forget it.",1

"Such a movie with such a cast only comes around, after all, once in a... ummm... blue moon. It's all about getting what you want when you want it.",1

Humour at anytime and very subtle.,1
But he only likes to sleep in the tops. Apparently nobody thinks that Cooper can buy the total pair and sell half to Colbert. ! She is seen as quite mercenary towards Cooper - selling herself to him on her terms. What if Brooke sells them each half? So the sale is not allowed.,1
"Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were enchanted. I thought "" The Taming of the Shrew "" was very funny. It looks like a catastrophe. But he sleeps only in the tops. Of Course, Lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process.",1
"Herman Bing has the best supporting role in the film as that selfsame, flustered detective. But Cooper's a good sport about it, he always settles with his ex - wives for a $ 50, 000. Of course Cooper is an American and Colbert of the cast is the only one actually of French background. She'd like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get it. Sounds like what we now call a pre - nuptial agreement.",1
The film is full of sight - gags like this balanced with verbal wit which makes it just about perfect.,1
The film kept my interest wonderfully. Leonard Maltin disliked it.,1

"The most chilling drama I've ever seen. Terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, anytime.",1
This is an extremely well done show. This show is not 24 or any of the cop shows on TV and is not trying to be anything either. It is genuine and unique.,1
"To the uninitiated, there is much to be learnt about the Muslim faith here.",1
It tries to present both sides of Islam.,1
And more intense with a FBI's infiltrate. I give 7 of 10.,1

"It wasn't until episode four ( "" Scholar "" ) when I was well and truly impressed. < br / > < br / > I read the synopsis on the DVD cover and I was immediately intrigued. The main protagonist is Muslim? He's very charismatic and authoritative. No way, this is a first!",1

"And who is Davey? Of course, the VW Thing has mysteriously died at that point, so odd Mr. Slausen ( Chuck Connors ) offers his help. Tourist Trap "" is among my favorite late 70's / early 80's horror flicks. 7 out of 10.",1
I really really liked this one. They pay dearly.,1
Which makes it creepier.,1
beware.,1
From then on I would never judge a film based on it's rating again. If you don't believe me see Darkness Falls or They. This is most likely what happened to Tourist Trap. When the film opened in 1979 it was given a PG rating by the MPAA. Or how about the pipe in the back with the blood running out of it. ) 9 % of the horror films that have come out of Hollywood lately. That alone was enough to guarantee Poltergeist success. ( Director David Schmoeller talks about this problem on the DVD's commentary track. ),1

I love this movie!,1
"is spoken. A bit surprising is total lack of nudity, though. Don't you just hate them slashers that never seem to get started? Tourist Trap "" isn't like that! Plenty of it AND constantly from start to finish!",1
"The mannequins look very sinister and the climax is horrifying. "" 9 out of 10.",1
"While Tourist Trap might not be absolutely essential viewing ; it'well worth seeing and I can recommend it. On the whole, this is a very good film. It's not the acting that's the star of the show, however, and as you might expect - the creepy atmosphere takes that prize.",1

< br / > < br / > What can I say?,1
Peggy Lee appeared in very few feature films. The Jazz Singer ( 1952 ) is no different. The synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice. Nobody in this film has a Eastern European accent.,1
"< br / > < br / > At this time, he meets Peggy Lee, an aspiring singer. His singing is up to par as the film ends on a positive note. If anything, this is glossed over. However, young Mr. Golding has quite a zest for show business.",1

"Well they never really show a close up of the ring ). And I think she thought there was more. That was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand.

"Not bad, not bad at all.",1
"If you have a chance, see this movie!",1
I love Pauly Shore. I love it!,1
Pauly Shore is brilliant! This is fun for viewers of all ages.,1
He is secretive and avoids friendship. The camera work is also excellent.,1
With an imagination that good the friend should be WRITING not Dreaming. Eventually he does respond to Magnani - he has to do so or they would be no film.,1
I enjoyed the acting in this movie. Except for the sister.,1
"Still, worth catching. The movie does have problems.",1
< br / > < br / > It's hard to place this movie under one label.,1
"< br / > < br / > But film is not mere comedy. You will not sleep through this lecture. Both dealt with love between a man and a woman. Both had the main characters living in a "" hotel "".",1

"This is, without doubt, one of my favourite horror films ever!",1

PS Toni keep on acting like this we need an encore.,1
"The actor, Toni Servillo, is superb, he excels this "" quiet man "".",1
He's a tax expert gone wrong who lives in a hotel. Don't see this if you're an action - buff.,1
"The first half of the film may be described as "" slow "" by some. He says : you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth.",1
"Don't expect a $ 10 million film. cuz you'll be disappointed. So watch it, then decide.",1
One of my all - time favourite movies.,1
I own this movie.,1
"Who killed the replacement girl and why? < br / > < br / > I wish I taped it though, I'd like to see it again.",1
< br / > < br / > Anthony James plays one of his classic TV bad guy roles. It's also interesting to note that Gerald McRaney had a role in this Rockford file episode.,1
( 2 ) What did Karen actually see at the hotel that made the mafia kill her? This is personal for Jim Rockford.,1
Easily deserves a 10.,1
"This time, its Vincent Minette who Rockford helps apprehend. And I'm smarter than you! "" She looks terrific here. So of course that makes Jim an immediate suspect. This is a very noir kind of episode. Frankly, they were right, though I prefer later Lt. Chapman to Lt. Diehl.",1
< br / > < br / > Reason ( which Granger considers his strong point ) reigns and frustration reigns supreme - for a while.,1
Bergman and comedy don't quite go together.,1
Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock. Even though there are many new faces their performances were top class. so it is all the more tense. I don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long. U never know when they will get killed or what they are up to.,1
"But the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary, you almost wish it not to end. May he rest in peace!",1
He was right - I was hooked immediately. < br / > < br / > Both of them are why I am a BUFFY fan today. So I went out and bought Season One boxed set.,1
He's a commando and she's the Slayer. So they steal the voices of everyone in town. Giles ignores It really is a classic.,1
My vote is ten.,1
That should tell you something. Unfortunately it didn't win.,1
Episode No.,1
"It's Dean's behavior towards Cassie sheds a whole new light on him, in fact. To a certain level I agree with the racism debate, but it didn't bother me that much, really.",1
"And, oh boy, she did a wonderful job. But don't worry.",1
"< br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) : "" Rota 666 "" ( "" Route 666 "" ) My vote is seven.",1

That was a total mismatch of characters. The next 2 follow ups with James Garner as Call just didn't make it for me. And that Lorena marries Pea Eye?,1
"Do yourself a favor and check it out, Ol'Gus would be proud!",1
But so what? Louis Gossett jr. deserves special mention as horse wrangler Isom Pickett.,1
"He is Captain Call. Great cast, great story.",1

"Might be a good double feature with American Beauty as well. Again, excellent.",1

"Or horror, or even suspense.",1
"As a viewer, you crave to help this poor woman understand the things that overcome her, but you simply can't.

"So of course I grabbed it while I could as it was the only copy there. Then this movie is for you!!!! I really loved Fox's car the most which was a worked Dodge Charger. They don't turn back, the don't give.. and the don't ask for help.",1
"This movie features 1 of Aussies greatest muscle cars, the XYGTHO. The car action will keep you comin back for more and more.",1
It also provides food for thought.,1
"Uzumaki, to me, seems clearly influenced by these films. They were films loaded with atmosphere but short on actual horror.",1
VERY memorable comedy.,1
"It has just enough wackiness and insanity, it touched me. Sort of like atwisteddrama. I was dead wrong. To be honest, I thought this movie would be a Japanese drama. The overall coloring of this picture makes for a somewhat demented story.",1
"This is, indeed, a "" Weird Tale "" par excellence. < br / > < br / > Simp stunning.",1
A great trippy film. < br / > < br / > This may take a few viewings for it to sink in.,1
"Possibly as psychologically damaging as "" The Ring "". Recomded!",1
My Rating : 7 / 10.,1
It is a great horror film that is not actually scary or suspenseful but somehow... eerie.,1
rather than to jolt. A bizarre image. Why?,1
"But, unfortunately, the story somewhat falls flat.",1
"< br / > < br / > Very bizarre, but very imaginative and unique movie. < br / > < br / > The ending was odd. I must say, if they really are debuting here, they do a pretty good job.",1
"Hey now, I have never laid eyes on a Manga comic, but apparently this movie is based on one. 8 out of 10 stars. My favorite was the father with spinning eyeballs, personally.",1
"< br / > < br / > The acting wasn't great, but not too horrible either. I rated it 7 / 10. Sound silly? * SPOILERS * below. Direction was top notch, sure a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and stylish. Firstly, the good stuff. I felt the pacing especially initially was a little slow.",1
This film reminds me of eerie indiana.,1
It'simultaneously provocative and fun.,1
"Uzumaki "" is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is top - notch. 7 out of 10.",1
"In the local café he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. I would have preferred a little more drama! Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt.",1
That's not true in Japanese horror.,1
Hats off to Sekhar.,1
"However, it does have some massala of it's own. Anand is one of those low - budget but well taken movies.",1
"The beautiful lyrics by Veturi. ! < br / > < br / > Cinematography, deserves a mention. < br / > < br / > 2.",1
Anand as Raja has done well too. And he starts making Roopa feel comfortable and secure. !,1
See it if you get chance.,1
Through their reminiscences we glimpse two lives tragically cut short.,1
Some actors did great job.,1
I have a feeling that Finland has only like five actors.,1
It's an amazing piece of work.,1
The character development in the movie is first rate. Every emotion was captured brilliantly in the movie.,1
I would rate it a 7. This is a very good film.,1
I loved every minute of it!,1
8 / 10 Cold climate changes us. The acting is great as well. Jasper Pääkkönnen has become one of the top Finnish stars.,1
Correct me if I'm wrong ).,1
Hola!,1
The audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive.,1
That's what being in the Marine Corps and WWII did to him!,1
"Well, he's the MAN.",1
"He is an actor's actor. As Federico, he does what he does best.",1
"I highly recommend it. In fact, these are what make the film outstanding.",1
No idea why. Would love to see it again.,1
They delivered. Soon came Skateboard Odyssey Mission Viejo.,1
"That's just a bit of the story behind it. I think you should buy this movie if you are a skater. Even if you are not,UY! This movie was awesome. Soon, the Zepher Surf team was formed. They started it by skating in drained swimming pools.",1
"Sean Penn does a great job of narrating the documentary. I don't know if I actually want to see the movie, but who knows.",1
"It's pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by Jan at such a young age. I watched it at the time, and didn't get it. I wish this movie was available, cause I would love to see it again.",1
I never knew that.,1
"Good, entertaining and accurate era - feel to most scenes. Right there.",1
"I wanted to know the men behind the myths. I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. He was sincere ; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project. While I This suddenly transformed into the film I wanted to see. I hate films about sports.",1
Brilliant. It still does.,1
The documentary stars the members of the Zephyr Team and is narrated by Sean Penn. It also focuses on the history of skateboarding.,1
"All of the original members except Jay Adams and Chris Cahill are still well and surfing / skating. Chris Cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in Mexico. Jay Adams, at the time of documentary, was serving time on drug related charges.",1
< br / > < br / > from Andy Frye at MySportsComplex.,1
"This is all good. Altman's prediction hasn't quite come true. I highly recommend "" Dogtown.",1
few come out on top.,1
Just saw Baby Blue Marine again after 30 years.,1
The terrific rock soundtrack likewise seriously smokes. Marvelously narrated with delightfully easy'n'breezy nasal nonchalance by Sean Penn.,1
"As well as failures such as injury or burning out. Without the urge for them to retort to recent footage of the more famous surfers and skaters that remains popular today. This resulted in a better picture to be drawn. < br / > < br / > Overall, truly outstanding effort. < br / > < br / > The film explores areas such as the success, such accomplishing new tricks, winning competitions and gathering fame.",1
skateboarding was a fact. At a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on. See you. So they try something else. There were a couple of competitions and one national competition. This is taking place in a not so nice area to live in.,1
It was THEIR opinion of their skating that mattered..... not yours or mine. Kudos to Stacy Peralta for making beautiful piece of art! Whenever it comes on cable I can't change the channel.,1
The footage is brilliant. I remember when skateboarding had it's rebirth in the 70s. That's feeling this film gave me.,1
"Buy the DVD, you won't regret.",1
I have seen this movie twice now on cable. JOB WEL DONE!,1
"I'm sure it's at least a tad biased, but aren't all documentaries? Worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or, as in my case, anyone who grew up in the 1970 '.",1
"The soundtrack, not surprisingly, was good as well. < br / > < br / > Seen on 5 / 11 / 2002.",1
But it tends to focus more on what is at the core of skating.,1
But I never forgot. I cannot watch this film enough.,1
"At one with the forces of nature. radical. < br / > < br / > But I have always admired the X - games types and surfers especially. Ramps, downgrades, low sweeping curves while interacting with the cement waves beneath their feet.",1
Anyone looking to learn more about the development of skateboarding should find Dogtown and Z - Boys adequate research material.,1
I have heard so much hype about this movie but I came to find it lacking.,1
Do these two give bad performances? 8 / 10.,1
"BRAVO! But, an interesting insight into human nature. In most movies, they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched. < br / > < br / > Fun to watch, NO FREAKING WAY! It came as no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and draining movie.",1
They live on an island working as farmers. The film has powerful message and is a good film.,1
A must see.,1
The acting was very well done. Right! Not a single cast member left me disappointed.,1
These include quotes from Hitler to Vietnam Era American military figures.,1
< br / > < br / > Shame represents a high point in the career of a master. We see the way the external pressures of the war complicate and corrode their relationship.,1
"Everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality. Although the storyline itself was not too impressive, the content of film was.",1
"They are not reclusive intellectuals, either. It doesn't care what war it is.",1
"I am not a "" fan "". As an emotional film it is touching but never fully moving. "".",1
Very well done movie.,1
This film must seen.,1
"< br / > < br / > The first half plays like a black comedy. As in a modern short story, it's done in the abstract, with no real names, cities, or countries used. The victimized couple are named Rosenberg.",1
Great costumes! Loved this movie! Love the script. Love the characters. Love the idea.,1
My vote is nine.,1
< br / > < br > < br / > < br / > But I definitely don't regret to have gone on watching it. I watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago. An excellent Bergman.,1
"His religious themes this time is kept very low key, even as idea of keeping a sort of faith pervades the film's atmosphere. Needless to say this is not one of the easier films to go through in terms of Bergman's filmography, however for some it may be one of his more accessible works. < br / > < br / > And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eva is corresponded successfully with the backdrop of a chaotic kind of war - ground where the lines are never too surely drawn. When there is war action it's shot in unconventional, quick ways ( via great amigo Sven Nykvist ).",1
"A gruelling watch, but one of Bergman's finest films.",1
This creates a huge tension and makes every event meaningful. But what about war? In Skammen that idea is extended to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war.,1
"< br / > < br / > Highly recommended. Nor is this a romanticisation of war or patriotism, unlike most war movies. Through much of the film they are spectators, much as we are.",1
"The pair could be anyone. A unique and effective war film, unlike any other.",1
"Good locations, good filming.",1
is one of the most fun and enjoyable low - budget films I've seen in quite some time. STMD! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some.,1
"It's a pity that in "" The Other Boleyn Girl "" she's so inadequate.",1
the supporting cast. and it works. it's more of a romance / drama.,1
"The Civil War sequences are absolutely great ; they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and dehumanizing. Comparing the two movies, the premise is quite similar.",1
"Here's how. < br / > < br / > Astounding scope, beautiful words, great acting and great music.",1
Kidman was also too old to play the ingénue and Law's love interest. < br / > < br / > Romantic epics need a convincing heroine. Ray Winstone was excellent as the London / Southern villain. Even Natalie Portman would have been an improvement.,1
I just saw the DVD and loved it.,1
"Now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials. I thought she played the part of the hillbilly girl very well. I think that was true. She deserved the credit she got for it. I like to be surprised by next scene, not know what is going to happen before it does. Even the love story was opposite.",1
"There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. Gratuitous nudity. It's supposed to. If you like slashers, you'll really appreciate this film. It's a lot of fun. Zero budget. "" Sound familiar?",1
< br / > < br / > The blonde albino character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since I saw the film. I cried for about two hours straight after wards.,1
< br / > < br / > Title ( Brazil ) :'Cold Mountain I liked this film a lot. My vote is nine.,1
"It is a romance, a war story, an action - adventure and historical fiction, all nicely woven into one. < br / > < br / > The film surfs through genres as needed - never presenting a dull moment. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. Inman's experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image.",1
It seemed to apply to all times.,1
"< br / > < br / > Then again, calling Cold Mountain "" a war movie is not entirely accurate.",1
8-Oct,1
stunning quotes. so prot's hospitalization is just a trigger to the plot. catch a beam of light. now.,1
The edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims. Cue the child ` s frightened screams. Hey I never said this show was tasteful did I?,1
< br / > < br / > A solid 85 %.,1
I always liked David Lynch and Cronenberg.,1
Once it did end....,1
"As far as "" violent images "" go, we don't see too much. Bridges is also excellent in his part. < br / > < br / > This movie doesn't really fall into any particular genre.",1
Was in serious doubt about renting the DVD or not. I can't really find anything...... The visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well - chosen. Enjoy! The script is one of the best ever. < br / > < br / > Also the acting is great ( one of Kevin Spacey's best roles ). 10 out of 10 Just watched this and it was amazing.,1
"Prot is from the planet K - Pax. In fact, he tells them he can take one person back with him. One of the patients is missing and is never found again. This is my interpretation and theory, and I believe it is very sound. < br / > < br / > First, here is the plot. Prot and Robert became best friends.",1

"< br / > < br / > To me, this movie felt really uplifting and yet depressing in the end. Spacey delivers a great performance as Prot. < br / > < br / > Go on, and enjoy.",1
< br / > < br / > 9 of out 10 rating - Superb - with nominal room for improvement.,1
"< br / > < br / > Prot's manner is courteous and cooperative. Of what will actually happen on that date, nobody is certain.",1
"And that's exactly what this movie is! "" Great movie!",1
Retards.,1
"I had no idea what to think. Needless to say, I loved it. After seeing the movie, I was blown away.",1
And he has to know.,1
"< br / > < br / > This is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer. Spacey is so believable as both alien and human, it makes the viewer's task that much more difficult. I rated it a 9 / 10. '< br / > < br / > Kevin Spacey once again delivers a marvelous performance as Prot. K - Pax is a very intriguing film.",1
I knew nothing about the history of the series. < br / > < br / > Spoilers here. Does anyone have any information on this?,1
All other cast members do a stellar job too.,1
A mixture of Alien and Ghost Busters?,1
< br / > < br / > In short : it's fun.,1
Lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes. < br / > < br / > I love this film. version. Much better in the U. S. version. It just doesn't belong in the movie. I was floored when I saw this.,1
Tobe Hooper was the man. She's one smoking hot number. < br / > < br / > Highest Recommendation!,1
One great similarity ( and this is always bad luck! ) both had mixed male / female crews - - the legend of Halley's comet and disaster continues!,1
"Based on the book "" Space Vampires "" by Colin Wilson. < br / > < br / > Not to be over - looked.",1
By far one of the best sci - fi films out there.,1
"So what? The beginning and end were ethereal. Enough to re - energize those hexagon cells and create new bat creatures. It seems they don't have carnal sex, like vampires of legend. It was also a beautiful love story. I assume the males souls also went up the ship, but not shown. < br / > < br / > What about all the humans killed?",1
"The tension builds to a very high level and ends in a way you'not expecting. It isn't clear whether or not he's the killer, since he seems surprised to see the body.",1
No.,1
"A naked girl can ` t escape from here "" Can ` t she? When mentioning LIFEFORCE in conversation with males it ` s always a race to say "" Seen alien in LIFEFORCE?",1
"The Col. wings it back to our big blue ball in an escape pod. < br / > < br / > Wow. God bless you, all of you who were involved. MINOR SPOILER : Yes.",1
'Lifeforce'is an adaptation of Colin Wilson's'The Space Vampires '. But the three humanoids remain.,1
"< br / > < br / > Now, do I think it's successful? < br / > < br / > It's not a good movie. No, "" Lifeforce "" is not a great movie. No.",1
"It's flamboyant and spirited entertainment. "" Big mistake.",1
We got zombies!,1
Danny Boyle was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the clappers. ).,1
The aliens are bought back to Earth... and that's where the incredible happens.,1
Some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time. A must see.,1
The Terror from Beyond Space'( 1958 ) - the immediate sources for'Alien'( 1979 ).,1
"It seems in every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim. Then the men discover that there is a pattern to the lifeforce process.",1
"But, all of a sudden, she has a secret admirer. A young Korean artist lives in Amsterdam. This is a beautiful picture to watch. How will this shadowy love triangle play out?",1
"Another erased there. I saw the Korean version of Daisy first. Wow! An entire scene added here. < br / > < br / > Then I got the DC and watched it. Same movie, but different feel. 2 seconds chopped off here. Amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions!",1
"Flowers! Nonetheless, she's terribly moved, and touched by this sole act. < br / > < br / > Hye - young is in love with this mysterious stranger.",1
).,1
"This film has "" haunted "" me since I saw it when I was about 8 years old.",1
Oh well. 'or'don't be prejudiced against ghosts!') I was dying to see how it lived up to my memories.,1
"This film is one of those that can't be regarded by its outwardness. And... what's the "" right thing ""?",1
Beautiful Brighton in 1937! < br / > < br / > The cinematography is just wonderful.,1
One of my favorite movies. Read the quotes.,1
"And, he does a woman'job - "" Floor's are my speciality "". I think I'll go home "". Frankly, I don't think he's a psychopath. Howard doesn't know and neither do we.",1
I recommend this movie.,1
"In April 1947, New York City faced an epidemic crisis.",1
< br / > < br / > Evelyn's on a mission also. And that's not an idle threat given the situation.,1
"Having smuggled $ 50, 000. A killer that's as old, or even older, then man himself.",1
Noir indeed. Don't be put off.,1
A good flick!,1
"Rough, grainy, edgy. Anyway, it was pretty effective. Everybody gets hassled. No egos here. And the cast.",1
Stinger has all qualities of a B - film horror movie. Can it get more unreal?,1
The suspense builds. What is this man capable of?. She is a war widow. 9 / 10. But how do we know? There are some scenes with O.,1
I might have fast forward some minutes here and there... I think this movie was made as good as it could have been.,1
"It was really incredible! Fans of any of these movies will, am sure, also love The Mascot. < br / > < br / > I am so glad that I did.",1
The Mascot is Ladislaw Starewicz's masterpiece.,1
"Dude B : "" Not to worry. For that matter, so is "" Vampyr "". "" We need to put something on there that won't cost much money. The plot comes through in the dialogue.",1
Characters come flying from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses. The Mascot features new techniques I have not yet seen in Starewicz's films. Twigss and newspaper shreds come to life.,1
"Now, think "" Toy Story "", circa 1934. Somehow, "" The Mascot "" delivers. One bit. Meaning, NO, your kids won't like it.",1
every toy is so detailed and very expressive that without words one can understand their motives. Anyone with the slightest interest in animation should give it a look.,1
archive.,1
The film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference. His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase. For whatever reason RKO thought to eliminate the age difference.,1
!,1
Enjoy! Strange people.,1
This is actually a brilliant movie.,1
Oh! There's really something missing in their brains!,1
My sides hurt.,1
"With one involving Christmas tree baubles immensely memorable. 7 / 10 One that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist. For fans of Robert Ryan tho, it's something of an essential viewing, oh yes, and then some.",1
8 out of 10.,1
"Not entirely sure how I stumbled upon this movie, but I'm so glad I did.",1
"When watching film, I never even realized it was the same actor. THE GREEN BUTCHERS ( Anders Thomas Jensen - Denmark 2003 ).",1
< br / > < br / > 9 out of 10.,1
< br / > < br / > More lines.,1
PLEASE check this movie out!,1
It's an incredible success. Personally I liked it lot. Their shop is expensive and it doesn't even have electricity all over the place. The same for the humor. < br / > < br / > Than a tragic accident happens.,1
The game is a FPS / Adventure game hybrid.,1
"The whole game is a quest. Oh, and acting is very good too. Its had to find now. This game is an action / adventure with combat. maybe Ebay. I thought it was a great game.",1
"It'nice and creepy. And there are plenty of gaming areas. Pick this game up cheap and have some fun. The puzzles are great, not too hard, not too easy.",1
we take great exception to it. Like confusing Texas with Coney Island.,1
I might just go away now and put it on! A lovely and nostalgic film. Wow!,1
The boy lover!,1
I won't say anymore about the plot less I spoil it for first - time viewers. This is one of his finest performances. This was one of my daughter's favorite films.,1
"It'a riveting scene, expertly done. Too bad. It's a nail - biter all the way.",1
The characters have depth and grow throughout the story. < br / > < br / > This is far from a perfect movie.,1
"- Not to worry, she'd be back within a half hour ; it was Saturday!",1
They are supported very well by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp ( as Mr. and Mrs. Brown ). Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's strained siblings. A sentimental classic.,1
it's a beautiful film.,1
!,1
Recomded.,1
The photography is stunning.,1
"She is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years. The film is indeed one that will appeal to the entire family, not just attention - addled youngsters.",1
It is good to remember it.,1
"That scene is probably what won her the Oscar. National Velvet also won one other Academy Award, for Film Editing.",1
< br / > < br / > What movie! This film shows all of that and more.,1
It was never about sex... it's about coming of age! The movie going world was that trusting in the 40's. Now we have it on DVD. ( The other being'The Wizard of Oz. ),1
The beautiful landscapes.,1
"A sentimental, heart - tugging family film set in England of the 1920s.",1
4 - - it's a lot better than that!,1
"There was adequate suspense, and I believe the violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer.",1
"You're going to the MOVIES! I, for one, miss them.",1
I absolutely loved this film... It definitely set mood perfectly. Very nice choice!,1
Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate as the two lovers.,1
Most go'that's it? The acting is superb.,1
< br / > < br / > I can't think of a better way to spend a spare 12 minutes.,1
The Youth In Us is a pitch - perfect gem.,1
"If you have read the novel, I recommend that you also view this movie. Overall I gave this movie a seven out of ten. Nothing can replace Joseph Conrad's original work however.",1
This movie is full of action and adventure. Marlow is then led to Kurtz's station home.,1
"his performance, as awarded, was stunning.",1
"The references to Ancient Egypt were thoughtfully inserted. But as far as an unadaptable book has been adapted, it is of good standard.",1
A little disappointing this episode.,1
"And here they are. You like "" Lost "", you have to watch it. My vote is ten.",1
"Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win Ryan over, to little avail. He is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure. < br / > < br / > As a study in mental illness the movie isn't too impressive.",1
The movie was good.,1
"I'll go make popcorn. """,1
A kidnapping and a woman shot in the process. These two make an outstanding pair as they work together. One treat : < br / > < br / > Agent Hawkins : So fill me in. Did I skip anything?,1
It always escapes me why she was never credited? I think Roach and McGowan would have been beaten to death if they'd tried to do that now.,1
< br / > < br / > GREAT CAST!,1
I give it a ten on your scale. And the ending is PERFECT.,1
Go Coco!,1
John Dahl?,1
"Very, very good.",1
They work well as a pair. I want her to bear my children.,1
And it got it in France! this one has it all.,1
Very funny and an early Gang talkie classic. 9 out of 10.,1
Carla Gugino literally melts the screen in this crime caper. I cannot even describe it. The ending is perfectly sinister and you never see it coming. Great chemistry. I disagree.,1
Franke rocks. I'd love to know. ( spoilers? ),1
But it's very grossly entertaining and scary.,1
!,1
"It'possible, but difficult.",1
"It has some really good plot twists too, and the effects are extremely well done, plus the ending is great. < br / > < br / > The Acting is very solid!. The Direction is great!.",1
It sums up Anatomy nicely. < br / > < br / > Hats off to the actors involved as well. Her central performance as Paula is a great foundation for the movie to build from. Cue one plucky student investigating herself and uncovering a giant conspiracy. I was going to use'The German Scream'as a summary but that was already taken lol.,1
This is one I think most could enjoy.,1
He loved it!,1
< br / > < br / > It as what all those films don't.,1
"< br / > < br / > Steven Ruzowillzky makes a fair effort of the script and the direction, but pushes no boundaries other than the general theme.",1
"Regardless this is a well done, scary and excellent thriller. The ( mild ) nudity was, in a refreshing twist, male! I saw ( unfortunately ) the dubbed version on Encore. I give this 7.",1
This movie was an out - lash to that.,1
"Okay, but then the film would be over within a half hour. I did, and was I pleasantly surprised!",1
"IT DOES NOT MATTER! He is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him. He also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with Richard Benjamin. She is matched every step of the way by Matthau, who is more charming than ever. There is not much of a plot to this movie.",1
"It's funny! Could be. But, still - - it's Walter Matthau in drag!",1
"That's where the similarities end, though. """,1
"< br / > < br / > One day Charlie notices Ann in the hospital. So now he's the eligible bachelor. He gets her out of the device, and soon is romancing her. < br / > < br / > Matthau's Charlie has just been widowed before the film began.",1
We are otherwise entertained by the on - off relationship of the two leads and various sub - plots.,1
"I'm very glad it'out on DVD now, finally. Just get this movie.",1
"Of course, Charley is on the show's discussion panel, and sparks, as they say, fly.",1
"It's must see for any Matthau fan or any fan of light comedy. < br / > < br / > You won't be disappointed. """,1
"True to his word, the dreams that Wong has involve having mad donkey sex with smokin'hot schoolgirls - but the dreams come with a price that's more than money. Definitely worth a look, especially to the genre enthusiast.",1

Excellent performances all round.,1
Give it a watch.,1
< br / > < br / > An absolute must.,1
Toysome horror done well almost.,1
"Lame, but scary at the time ) and the first three quarters of this film really hit the spot for me. The first half hour in particular was awesome.",1
"Now. And they really work well with each other. Go see it. But if your out for a good, stylized scare then it's perfect.",1

"I saw'I Smell the Dead'- - sorry,'I SELL the Dead'- - at a press screening.",1
The cast is first rate.,1
This has advantages and drawbacks. Grimes is killed with a Guillotine.,1
His partner had already been beheaded.,1
< br / > < br / > See.,1
"< br / > < br / > This would be a fun and unusual date movie. Nice voice in the narration, too.",1
< br / > < br / > I'm increasing my rating to 7 / 10. May be it was the big screen viewing that helped?,1
It was that missing tooth. I thought he was excellent in that role.,1
It works well.,1
You bet.,1
But there's something different about this corpse. ( Note : I saw I SELL THE DEAD at the Glasgow International Film Festival on 20th January 2009. ),1

"There really isn't much to the story, it's simple and it works well. If you like horror, watch this. An easy film to just sit down and enjoy.",1
"Bonus : Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! The performances make the movie. I just saw this at SIFF, and I absolutely loved it.",1
I sell the dead revolves around convicted grave robber Arthur Blake. < br / > < br / > The acting isn't amazing but I didn't find it bad at any point.,1
They played off each others acting with ease.,1
< br / > < br / > Overall the movie offers something very different to the current crop of mainstream horror and will leave a smile on your face. I saw this movie as part of the Midnite Madness at Sitges.,1
).,1
"That is definitely so not true and very, very sad. What was explored was done well, for the most part. Oh well. That wasn't too great.",1
"< br / > < br / > As Lucille Ball, Rachel York does a commendable job.",1
"I thought Rachel York was fantastic as "" Lucy. "" And Rachel certainly gave us that, in great depth. Lucy didn't fit mold of the old studio system. My response to that is, "" So what? "" She is a chameleon who can play ( and sing ) anything!",1
This is worth watching. This is speculation.,1
I highly recommend.,1
This film is completely underrated.,1
Even she managed to upstage Caine. He was hilariously funny through out.,1
"The Sea Tiger lets loose six torpedoes but has to dive, not knowing if it had done its job. They just miss the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and heads into the Baltic. And it helps that he's lucky. After several tense situations, the confrontation takes place.",1
That's what this film is about.,1
Look as being Anglo - Irish I assure you this reviewer is anything but Bias. I laughed a lot.,1
Never mind.,1
As was Mr Gambon and the mad Scottish hitman. < br / > < br / > She has most amazing smile. This man should do much more comedy. The Parole officer.,1
It wouldn't be real otherwise.,1
"If anything, it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda. < br / > < br / > There was a wee bit too much shore - side drama for my tastes. This is an excellent tub - thumper from the war years.",1
Caine's character seemed overdone to me.,1
"You get to see some Kansas City locations and lots of raw meat, what could be better?",1
"The story is great, the gore is grand, the psychos are wicked!",1
"I love the old Drive - In fare like this movie. I am a glutton for B - movies. Don't expect Romero, just second - rate Fulci. I was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock. It is gory. It has great camera work, and some cool editing tricks.",1
< br / > < br / > I loved this movie! Just watched this one again.,1
Wow. Zombie Bloodbath 2 : Rage of the Undead is next. Both groups end up at the same house. It was fun and the acting was pretty darn good for a low budget effort. And this is all in the first half hour. At the same time a group of convicts escape from a nearby jail.,1
"So I say kudos to Mr. Not this movie. I give this film two bloody thumbs up! Sheets for trying to do something different with this one. It never stops long enough to let you catch your breath. Even a movie like Bone Sickness that I like, has incredible stretches of DULL. I would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish DV shot flicks that I have bought. OK. < br / > < br / > Zombie Bloodbath 2 : Rage of the Undead.",1
"Her corpse is subsequently "" raped. "" The makeup / gore is much better than ZB1. I've really never seen anything like it. It's big and it keeps moving. < br / > < br / > 2.",1
"However, it was a pretty suspenseful mini - series.",1
"The Dismissa is now available on DVD in Australia. Watch it, learn from it and learn about our modern history. The leads were perfect.",1
"This shift was codified in the Australian Constitution. These are more or less regarded as the "" reserve powers of the Crown ( king / queen of Great Britain ). "" As time went on, it became apparent that Australia was capable of standing on its own two feet. Australia was colonised by the British.",1
The clear standouts for my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor.,1
"< br / > < br / > Brooke Vandenberg ( Jane Kennedy ) is the senior female reporter on the show. < br / > < br / > "" Frontline "" boasts an ensemble of colourful characters, each with their own distinct and quirky personality.",1
"What is really sad is that it also makes extremely funny. His doesn't have principles so much as a nous of what makes a good journalistic story, though he does draw occasional line.",1
Even better it worked on my NTSC DVD player. Great stuff!,1
"Kingdom County, Vermont, 1927.",1
In the end it is a tragedy.,1
Jay Craven's criminally ignored film is a sober breath of fresh air in the generally narcissistic and derivative world of independent film.,1
Cinematographer Paul Ryan was exceptional. Fox. < br / > < br / > And the story itself...?,1
"< br / > < br / > I've seen it maybe twice since then. I think some parts are little cheesy, maybe the plot could use some more action.",1
The film's greatest moments come during the various fantasy sequences where we see just how they cope. The backdrop of this story is the 1967 World's Fair and the Centennial of Canada.,1
An entertainingly brainless piece of lovably lousy dreck.,1
Ghoulies IV.,1
"Is it stupid? In fact, I really enjoyed it.",1
Jonathan is back once again in this one. It's a great dark comedy and funny! Then you've got the very hot Alexandra! Ghoulies 4 is pretty ghoulish sequel. I doubt it will happen though.,1
lol. I enjoyed the plot of the movie.,1
7,1
It's one of his best performances as he is very restrained and moving. She plans to drive into America's heartland and start anew. Then comes in the character of'Killer'played by James Caan.,1
* * SPOILERS * * Simple movie about simple people who's problems are far too complex for them to handle. < It seems that Mr. Alfred is also the acting county judge and is the person that Natalie is to pay her traffic fine to.,1
"Coppola toys with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we've been made privy to. It's a heady endeavor - - so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later.",1
It's extraordinary in ways that mirror others in Coppola's films. It's one of those rare original dramas where some scenes stand alone as total knockouts.,1
The directing was fabulous work.,1
< br / > < br / > A sequel of sorts is in the works. Diesel is particularly good at getting under the skin of his intimidating character.,1
"This kind of movie always tends to be fun, as long as it's done well. I believe that Pitch Black was done well.",1
"Aliens can only be in darkness, hey it's a solar eclipse. I really can't wait for Chronicles of Riddick. It was. Black out every 22 years.",1
Unexpected.,1
"< br / > < br / > I see now that the movie works * extremely * well. That they were allergic to light was something I found especially ridiculous. Then we come to a planet with three suns. I thought Claudia Black's character was the first to die. It's much more of a human drama. There isn't an excessive, tiresome focus on the monsters. This was not so. I thought Riddick was the sole survivor. Based on my first viewing, I recently rated this movie a 5.",1
Oh my gosh!,1
! He would be the most logical choice for the role.,1
All in all this is a very good movie though not perfect.,1
"Too bad, because PITCH BLACK actually does kick major ass. They are not alone on the planetoid.",1
!,1
etc. The acting is above average. Because it'stylish. The only question really is who's next to snuff it.,1
"It's impossible. OK, enough comparisons. It maches well into Alien series.",1
I really enjoyed this movie. In Pitch Black he plays an anti - hero to the max.,1
"This film gets off to a bad start. Thrilling, horrifying and exciting. By the time night falls, it is great.",1
But to plainly put it : This movie freaked me out... in a good way. He certainly keeps you guessing right up to the very end.,1
"Sound to good to be true? I was captivated. Don't take my word for it... see it for yourself. I just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it.",1
The crew have to rely on him to try to get them to safety. < br / > < br / > Roll on Chronicles ofiddick!,1
< br / > < br / > Technically the film is very good. < br / > < br / > From the opening shot to the But the film belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the most magnetic screen presence I've seen in years. Sometimes he draws your attention by not speaking - or by not moving. This is without doubt the most exciting and satisfying film I've seen in years! The lighting effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - the overbright triple sunlight and the pitch darkness.,1
You won't be disappointed.,1
This isn't a deep film by any means. The ship has been hit by something. < br / > < br / > It opens with a galaxy of stars.,1
Pitch Black is a survival story. Characters start to live in the movie. He does great job as Riddick.,1
"But this is one of my favorites. Beyond that, people wont be bothered to watch it. The music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful. I think there'5 movies altogether. Who remembers the movie about the St Benard Beethoven?",1
Will Upton uncover Uncle Willie and Banker Clanton's treacherous scheme? This film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of climactic shootout.,1
"The Movie takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time I watch it. < br / > < br / > The music is great and the dancing is wonderful! "". Jennifer Grey plays Frances "" Baby "" Houseman in Dirty Dancing. Baby is going to start college in the Fall. and then realizing just how stupid that was!",1
I would love to live such a story.,1
2,1
"He sings "" She's Like The Wind "" in the movie. Like I said it's an amazing chick flick. I love all the dancing and everything that goes with it.",1
"< br / > < br / > An amazing film, perfect for a girly night in.",1
!,1
They were both such good dancers. I was so wrong. I love the music and the dancing. !,1
without them i think it would be a mess. patrick an Jennifer did so well together.,1
Dirty Dancing - The Way Love Is Mean To Be!,1
"there's a bit of a romance angle that's hinted at. there's gunfights, action, chases on horseback. even though movie is in 1943, it is in colour. it's got pretty much everything a western should have.",1
The song is perfect and the dancing is amazing!,1
I also loved the dancing - - who WOULDN'T? And the ending was absolutely FANTASTIC.,1
).,1
"< br / > < br / > The dancing in "" Dirty Dancing "" is not to be forgotten.",1
"I do now. Exceede my expectations! And she did really look awkward at times. Nevertheless, still very good.",1
!,1
That was a mistake.,1
And definitely not during war time.,1
"This is the best movie ever, but that is my opinion.",1
9 every time.,1
"He gives his character a comprehensive personality, strong appeal and great depth. I would highly recommend it.",1
"It happened anyway! I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical. It has the love story, the music, and most of all lots of dancing.",1
Swayze was brilliant just like Grey was too!,1
I can't even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing.,1
Yeah.,1
I have my doubts.,1
Be forewarned! I love Meatballs!,1
"Look out! "" What, no mustard?! """,1
"no mustard? """,1
"They're insipid, vulgar, and, most importantly, not funny.",1
The film is also full of funny one liners.,1
"One nice thing about this movie, it has a message. The story line is simple and easy to follow.",1
"Unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy. All this stuff doesn't necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943. < br / > < br / > In 1863, the economy in the town of Red Valley, Utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the Union Army.",1
He really seems to have some good chemistry with Makepeace. The biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director. Above it all is Bill Murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut.,1
"The plot is predictable. It has been done many times in other movies. It's rated PG. "" They are horribly bad.",1
To each his own.,1
"The rest of the can are just as crazy as Tripper. Meatballs "" packs lots of comedy in this film. stars!",1
A real riot.,1
"Meatballs "" promises such and ultimately delivers nourishing watch.",1
"( "" Lobsters... get out of here... you're a menace! "" Or maybe he's just that great - turning a weak script into comic genius. The best part are his surreal PA announcements. We also get some truly lame slapstick, mostly in the opening credits. It's just plain awful.",1
Let's hope he completes the trilogy. The rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated.,1
The film mostly contains hi - jinx of fellow teen camp counselors cutting up and goofing around. I'm licked and just can't help loving this. It's a summer camp movie through and through which simply wants to entertain you.,1
"It's a great "" root for the underdogs "" finale. This is easily the best of the summer camp movies.",1
"It just doesn't matter. Or "" Whitewater Summer ""? Spaz.",1
It is a must - see.,1
"I can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining. That's what MEATBALLS ( MB ) is. The opening title song that goes "" Are you ready for the summer?...",1
The movie has heart. He reminds us of the funny cool staff member who everyone loves.,1
"wife? Thanks good a movie like this was done and released. The music doesn't pretend too much but it achieves a lot, not more than a snare drum, cymbal, a some strings. < br / > < br / > The kind of movie that demands too much from the audience, yet to disappoint most of them.",1
Yes.,1
"So I recommend to get some Melox before the show, because you won't get hungry after all. Crónica "" is something difficult to digest, it get stuck in the throat and anything helps for it.",1
!,1
Rent it.,1
Her chameleonic portrayals never fail to astonish ; she seems actually to be the characters she brings to the screen. Meryl Streep may be the greatest actor working today.,1
I loved this movie.,1
It's a masterpiece. It's about time Hollywood got their act together. !,1
"While on the other hand, she admires her father - who shares a special passion : Writing. But it is Renee Zellweger who steals this movie. These terms are only general.",1

"Which isn't to say that it's a bad movie. and "" who? """,1
"The characters were perfectly casted. And indeed, that this could happening to you. In fact, the movie is down right depressing.",1
I give this one ten.,1
"I don't think she's cold at all, but instead has thought out her character's unique qualities. I think her critics are confusing self - consciousness with intelligence.",1
He is not strong enough to cope. This movie mirrors the reality of life. No breaks! The story takes a very realistic view on the illness of a parent. She is wonderful is every part that she plays.,1
"Zeleweger is seething, angry and surprised with herself.",1
She's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how. ) ).,1
You see humanity at its best AND at it's worst. That there is only one true thing and that is... love.,1
John Carradine thought he was so high and mighty. I like every actor in this movie. John Carradine wasn't Dracula and he never will be.,1
"you can't help but enjoy this schlock fest! But remember, I never said it was good, just fun. no mummy? )",1
it packs quite a punch. At 1 hour 7 min.,1
"You may not recognize the names, but you will recognize every face. A film that deserved theatrical release.",1
"And the striptease number, like the'Jenny'number in Star! works. And so is maintaining innocence. I saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently.",1
Especially seeing the wolf man get cured. Yet somehow they return in House of Dracula with no explanation. It has many high points. Then there'd be no plot holes.,1

Great fun. Also starring Onslow Stevens ( Them!,1
"OK, to watch or not to watch. Not to denigrate Mr. Westmore's ability but horror films were just not his forte.",1
and then this one.,1
Recommended.,1
"There's even a microscope slide of the parasite that is believed responsible for the condition. House of Dracula "" isn't all that bad of a film and is rather decent at times. The Wolf Man has a marvelous scene where he transforms inside a prison cell to the doubting members of the search party and goes crazy. There is one main idea that is quite creative and imaginative. It's a thoroughly decent affair.",1
"There isn't as much action but the acting is just as good. "" ).",1
they are great people i bless them all. i love watching the Jericho mile. great movies get watched more than movies that are not.,1
"Naturally, this is just a ruse. It's a respectable series entry overall. The Wolf Man "", shows up and of course he * really * wants to be cured. Then, coincidentally, Larry Talbot ( Lon Chaney ), a. k. a. "" All - Monster congregation in the final film in Universal's renowned cycle of classic horror stories.",1
The discovery of Frankenstein's monster ( Glenn Strange ) in a nearby catacombs will bring more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist.,1
"Here, he would be justifiably criticized as wooden. A nice waste of time. 7 / 10. collapses on top of him and is consumed by flames. People underrate that film and Chaney's performance in it.",1
It gets a low 8. Many people want to compare it to House Of Frankenstein. The doctor becomes a bloodthirsty maniac at certain times. At least in House Of Frankenstein he was up and around a bit. Where does the hat go when he changes into a bat...? But it isn't a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes. He isn't chewing up the scenery as he will in later roles. This is a very underrated performance.,1
He seeks Dr. Edelmann's help to cure him of his vampirism.,1
"Then, what can only be described as a coincidence, sees Lawrence Talbot, a. k. a. The Wolf Man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction! < br / > < br / > Overall, this film isn't as good as the earlier House of Frankenstein.",1
"very cool "" as my youngest would say.",1
Fun! Lighthearted.,1
"The poking of fun out of this never comes to an end and rightfully so. < br / > < br / > For this end, in turn, there is no better profession than the bard.",1
"Gamers : DR is not a fancy made movie, it's more like amateur video.",1
"This is pure art, it's that good.",1
"The sexually confused player also had me smiling a bit too. < br / > < br / > The bard that always gets killed had me rolling. A real unexpected treat. But in the end... Best fan boy movie I've ever watched save "" Free Enterprise. """,1
The acting is fairly decent and the jokes are quite funny. With the help of some new blood they attempt the campaign again with hopes of finishing this time. Any case if you are a game or know about gaming check this one out you will enjoy it. < br / > < br / > This movie is a breath of fresh air in the movie community and a great improvement over the original. So this is why I give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 that I initially thought of.,1

The pacing perfect. And it was more than enough. It played to about 1000 people in a packed standing - room - only ballroom. The script was tight. The action tense. How often does that happen at screenings?,1
I saw Dorkness Rising and thought it was HILARIOUS! !,1

It is a great movie especially for kids. The French people are not known to be great movie producers.,1
For example the fighting between Numerobis and Amonbofis.,1

"Royal Architect Edifis seeks the help of Asterix, Obelix and druid Getafix to complete his task.",1
She's good but the role is little more than a cameo. I loved it. I loved it so much that I can't understand why the movies have never been released in the United States.,1
"In fact, only jokes were added to the story rather than content blended or removed! It is the first time I can recall where an adaptation did exactly like the book... Ah, watch the movie folks!",1
But overall an excellent movie! !,1
I always loved this film. The characters are appealing.,1
It maked the film to childies. Wow! Well.. they did it right this time!,1

"And Tromeo, a true romantic. < br / > < br / > Anyway, enjoy!",1
This movie is a dream coming true. And I've seen a lot. I really cared for the characters. It breaks many taboos. I'm not even a Troma fan.,1
"Like The Toxic Avenger, Troma's War, Class of Nuke'em High, Terror Firmer and Sgt. I enjoyed this movie very much. Kabukiman N. Y. P. D. this film is an instant Troma classic.",1

This movie is truly unique.,1
"Overall, well worth watching, better than the recent version in pretty much all departments. Margaret Tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as Clothilde.",1
Highly recommended. Tour guide Madge was irritating in a different way but often quite amusing. She threatens to go over the top towards the end but just avoids it. ! < br / > < br / > On the whole it is very faithful to the book.,1

Absolutely worth seeing.,1

It'great.,1
"IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role. This film is not going to tell you what the "" meaning of life "" is! Not as bad as many here have made it out to be. Everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them. What can I say? He's always great to watch and for my money... an extremely underused actor. < br / > < br / > I was not disappointed in the least. The idea is that after seeing the film, you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee. I certainly did.",1

She is an excellent part to the film.,1
Dead Line certainly fits the bill.,1
"Enjoy! But, anyway, it happens I make exceptions.",1
I was afraid that it would be excessively bloody and gory. I was wrong. I had real reservations before seeing this movie ( because of the cover ).,1
It's my number one favorite. They made all of the characters fit into a specific role.,1
I definitely recommend it! This movie is not that bad.,1
"The riddles are good, some are hard, some are not. Leave your mark, and will find you.",1

You are going to cry when you see this.,1
The producer and director came up with good idea and finally put an end to a film.,1
"Given five or six hours, perhaps Moorhouse could have made a movie more in keeping with Smiley's novel. < br / > < br / > I think I know why. And I guess "" Larry "" ( Jason Robards ) works for "" Lear. """,1

Come on! The writing's not that bad!,1
"! < br / > < br / > It was a particularly AWFUL day today, weather - wise. I don't think I had ever even heard of it before. It poured rain all day, so I popped in this movie and shortly after I was mesmerized.",1
"Our Mary Poppins? In fact it's quite entertaining. They won't recognize you. < br / > < br / > But on another note, who cares? Julie as a German Spy?",1
I didn't focus on this fact until years later. Maybe you are ready for it.,1
I gave it a rating of 9 out of 10.,1
"Kitty is now a knockout and "" Bouccy "" has a job for her. - and no one is the wiser. Shock!!",1
"Oddly, during this time, La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two kids as Shearer took them to Paris. Three years pass and apparently they'd been divorced during these years due to the infidelity. Neither tells anyone that they were married but it's obvious that her ex - wants the new and improved Norma back! My only real regret is that I didn't love the very end.",1
"And, the ending is quite clever. Shearer is stunned to discover the man is La Rocque, her ex - husband. < br / > < br / > Shearer and Dressler make this a cute, entertaining play. The cast uniformly fine.",1
"Full of cranks & crotchets, she is very humorous. < br / > < br / > Rod LaRocque doesn't come off too well as Shearer's adulterous husband.",1
For its time... a good show.,1
I recommend this one to all!,1
Maybe if someone could explain these I'd appreciate this short more.,1
These guys are without a doubt the single most incompetent bunch of doctors to ever fumble their way across the screen.,1
This is one I could never forget.,1
"1, whenever I feel like it, I watch this!",1
< br / > < br / > I liked this short.,1
May not be a fair comparison but I can see the Marx Bros. in this short.,1
"The game was on. This would go double for The 3 Stooges films. Every type of gag was in evidence. ( It all plays out quite well, honest! )",1
I enjoyed the film score by Joel McNeely. I am big fan of underwater films. I feel Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. Mr. Butler is a very talented cinematographer.,1
While there he befriends a dolphin named Flipper.,1
I like this movie.,1
< br / > < br / > Sorry for my bad English. But underwater shots definitely is best parts.,1
The affair btwn.,1
See the movie you will love it. Both actresses are very true to their role. It is about love.,1
It will be coming soon to a festival near you. See this film!,1
"Sure, there were some difficult facts to face, and choices to make, but it just flowed. Held back.",1
I could watch it over and over. Her friend showed me what a true friend really is. What a cozy a wonderful story! I guess he doesn't really appreciate her.,1
"The shooting was very tastefully done ; very matter - of - fact. The spare editing is accompanied by a beautiful, simple score.",1
Beautiful work and my applauds to all. What an ending! Thanks so much for making a great film!,1
"< br / > < br / > Of the six films we saw at the Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival, we thought this one was the best. NOTE : Stay for the credits! It will work on DVD, and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen. The Gymnast ( 2006 ) was written and directed by Ned Farr. The two women develop an act of the type performed by Cirque de Soleil.",1
Its all so magical.,1
Dreya Weber is an exquisite Jane.,1
Unexpected and inspiring. Nothing.,1
I loved it!,1
I truly enjoyed this film.,1
"It had more of a TV Show feel to it, which a lot of the "" Reality Shows "" have today.",1
See this one for a good time!,1
yes.,1
"He wanted Slayer to play in his backyard, MTV did it. < br / > < br / > If you liked Jackass, you'll fall in love with this. April : The woman who wants to live life by the book and follow tradition. I borrowed Season 1 from a friend last year, and I would give up my legs to meet the Viva La Bam Crew. Another thing which is surprising to see, is how casual Margera is over the whole thing.",1
The film is based upon popular urban legends and ghost stories. Overall I give this a 7 out of 10. While by no means a classic the directors involved do have an idea what suspense is.,1
Loved it!,1
It'about a biker and a ghosthouse. The last story isn't scary but atleast not bad. Rent this movie it is Good!! The first 2 stories are simply brilliant. ! Man this is scary!!,1
You should definitely take a chance and rent this one. I immediately had to grab it. Some of the plot I don't understand but once I watch it again I bet I'll get it.,1
"This is the true ghost story of the trio. I figured that if I didn't like its more acclaimed, bigger < br / > < br / > The second tale is more suspense. No need for cheap thrills here. < br / > < br / > The opening sequence is pure, fast - paced urban myth.",1
It scared me most of all stories. Wow!,1
Joyeux Samhai! A real discovery. This one is a keeper - - Jim Bob says check it out.,1
"Movie is not available on DVD, but can be found on VHS.",1
They just talk about the couple who they've crashed into. The cast who play theses characters are great. Everything about this film is just perfect. But there's very cool twist at the end.,1
"This story has a pretty good setup, but just merely an'ok'delivery. They're traveling around in an RV headed to Las Vegas. Set in It's about - you guessed it - two people on their honeymoon! < br / > < br / > The second story, "" The Honeymooners "" is, eh, okay. Trouble is, that internet buddy?",1
"Very good plot twist. People Can Lick Too. "" The Hook. "" OK, this was not the best of the 4.",1
"< br / > < br / >'The Locket ', however, was the unarguable masterpiece of this film.",1
"7 / 10. The first story was alright, and the motorhome sequence near the end was a little creepy. It is much better than what one would expect. It's a great anthology of some classic urban legends, and the whole film was tied together neatly.",1
This was good but it was the weakest of the entries. And it turned out to be quite a good little horror surprise! ( I won't spoil that for you! ) This was really chilling.,1
The four stories are well - paced and satisfying.,1
'Campfire Tales'certainly does not fit into that category. This campfire setting has a mysterious plot in itself. < br / > < br / > This film certainly did that job well! ). Find a copy and watch it... if you dare!,1
"Here is the scare - o - meter. I DIDNT MAKE SENSE. It had suspense, and not too gory. The actors were famous but not TOO famous.",1
I will not hesitate to get my copy on that day. I would like to say that I absolutely loved Campfire Tales!,1
"However, Jessica is actually a psychopath. My vote is seven. When the man returns from his herd, Scott finds the truth about Heather.",1
He was perfectly cast as well. The young man was gay to the hilt! He has hustler written all over him.,1
"Check it out... Several of the "" twists "" felt a little too forced and I could have used a tad more blood, but I really dug this much too under - rated blend humor and horror.",1
?,1
I thought it was very well done. But I'm not spoiling anything. I really loved this movie.,1
disappointing but with some great acting.,1
"I was really surprised, honestly. But the ending made up for the entire film. < br / > < br / > This film is interesting, to say least. < br / > < br / > Only the wife eats the mushroom.",1
"The intrigue and drama, not quite as much.",1
"Giving away more would do more harm than good. Ten minutes into movie, and things are looking really ugly.",1
"It just seemed a little dull. Twice. ( The wonderful voice makes up for the weird accent though. ) This one does. or "" Was that intentional? "" < br / > < br / > When you see this movie, see it at least twice. I like movies that make me think.",1
Certainly didn't see it coming!! Actors knew what they were doing.,1
"But, this film had B - movie all over it. So if you like to laugh rent this one. Okay, so this wasnt what I was expecting.",1
"Some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure. The next woman fell on a bed of icicles. Well, you have to see it for yourself. "".",1
"Overall, Jack Frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie. The first one was better though. The screenplay was, was also atrocious. Now he is immune to anti - freeze. They say that Sam's DNA combined with Jack Frost's. Hence, here's my point. 7 out of 10.",1
"YARRR! And finally, Captain Fun. < br / > < br / > This movie has it all. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with him. like babies. Yes, killer snowballs.",1
"But you have to understand, IT'S NOT A HORROR MOVIE. Jack Frost 2 is neither of these.",1
Dare i say osca winner.,1
Seeing old friends and meeting new characters. They looked like hand puppets.,1

"It certainly worked for me. Okay, I'll say it.",1
"Sometimes good things happen by accident. When I read the first book, I was left wondering "" Is that it? """,1
"Well, that's all I have to say.",1
I was deeply impressed with the character he played.,1
Straightforward honest images of an intense beauty.,1
8 out of 10.,1
"The result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast, with a heavy emotional current. They seem to have used natural lighting, but whatever they used works beautifully. Tensions broil and relationships are made and broken. The rest of the cast is quite capable, and fill their roles in well. Pharaoh's Army "" defies formula. The actors act 19th century, not like 20th century people in old clothes. """,1
I. T.!,1
< br / > < br / > High recommended.,1
B.,1
"And they are not remotely funny either. It was funny and well performed, and that was enough! I found it sad though when likes of Ben Elton took against both this and Benny Hill. It was certainly not'dreadful lazy comedy '. All soaps and reality dross. If nothing else, it provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to. but also enjoyed conventional stuff such as this.",1
"And mine - and I was a huge fan of "" The Young Ones "", too! Wonderful!",1
Eleanor Parker at her physical peak. A true comedy. The dialog is fast and very witty.,1
a fine romantic comedy. eleanor is also easy on the eyes.,1
"This movie is a hidden gem. And their chemistry is impeccable. Also, the supporting cast is wonderful as well. !",1
"NEVER SAY GOODBYE concerns the divorced couple, Flynn and Parker, and their mutual desire to remarry. This was the third time I tried to watch this film.",1
"All ultimately works out well, naturally, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery. It is Tucker, though, who "" tucks "" the movie under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the goal line.",1
"This movie is based on the game series : Final Fantasy. I love Cid, I think he's cute.",1
gorgeous!! ) !,1
I found it. Get the DVD now!,1
I really love this movie! !,1
The characters are incredible. I was completely blown away!,1
! Story 9. I LOVED IT!,1
"I generally like this movie a lot. For those who are curious on the same matter, I use the program Gmax by Discreet.",1
I am someone who has never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a series fan. This movie was definitely scripted with FF VII fans ONLY in mind. Thank goodness for wikpedia.,1
"The movie is really cool, I thought.",1
BUT there's a but.,1
"Buy the game, beat it and then watch it. Don't bother. Haven't played the game? Well, this is it. Impressive. Want to watch it and love it?",1
"< br / > < br / > See this movie. Square really landed this one. Bye. And boy, are those going to be happy fans when they see this movie! I mean, they are some of the best ever createdERIOD. It was, like, totally what I intended.",1
"Just watched it then. But like I said, just be accepting.",1
Like a dance. Yeah. Each scene background comes to life and tells its own story. Characters move with fluidity. The movie relies on the audience's knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements. And it does so very subtly.,1
A true feast for the eyes.,1
There is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing. Mad genius.ccept no substitute.,1
"The game was so extravagant with the In effect, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. And so, I'm reviewing this movie from a FF7 fan perspective, and with no regret. < br / > < br / > Sound - 10 / 10 The sound was fabulous.",1
And trust me when I say there's a lot of it. There is little to none realism in it outside FFVII world which serves the purpose. < br / > < br / > We all know you can't put a FFVII in 1. Some were not.,1
I loved every second of this movie. The action was necessary as much as people complained.,1
"Fight sequences move extremely fast, but after watching a couple of them your eyes should be used to it and it won't seem so confusing. Oh, and we finally get to see exactly how one equips Materia... < br / > < br / > Music : brilliant also. The most stunning things were definitely NOT given away in the trailers. Graphics : brilliant, obviously. I'm glad I preordered the OST.",1
"Great job, Klasky - Csupo!",1
Far too many things the Duck said make much more sense today. I doubt it will ever be on DVD though.,1
"It's a wonderful, highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish You name it, Duckman has done it. Nothing will ever surpass it.",1
"No one is happy in the film, even if they believe that they are. She cannot let that vision go. Did it all make sense? Another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress.",1
Note to horror filmmakers : some of us do like subtlety!,1
( It's why I gave it only a 9 ) < br / > < br / > But definitely an interesting film. I know movie amended the darker ending of the play - and I am not saying I missed the murder part.,1
YEAH!! David Boreanaz is Keith.,1
This is a great movie.,1
it's nice and cute and gives good time.,1
There wasn't a moment where i thought that it was unbelievable.,1
I think the quality I liked most about it was that it seemed rather realistic. Lisa ( Holly Lewis ) will be going away to a Christian school after the summer. Go figure. This information was actually confirmed by the director himself John Hazlett at the Q & A after the film. Not to mention that all the actresses in this film are way over 18 in real life. So as I entered the theater just hours ago I wondered what the final verdict would be thumbs up or thumbs down.,1
This film is outstanding!,1
It's Campy. The flute - sitar - rattle box soundtrack is classic. Maybe there all drunk. Try to find the longest cut you can. One more little note.,1
I saw this movie yesterday. I must admit - I love it!,1
It's like a video game brought to life.,1
I saw this movie by accident while in Paris.,1
I loved this film! humor.,1
Is Thursday an original film?,1
If you are a fan of cheap 70'sleaze than this is the film for you!,1
It really seems unbelievable. How old is he anyway?,1
"The acting is decent enough, with the entire cast clearly having fun with this plot. Thursday utilises a few characters mostly within a single location.",1

"Unforgettable. Much as Deliverance will always be remembered for it's awful rape of Ned Beatty, Thursday will go down as movie where a woman forcibly rapes an unwilling man. ONE GOOD THING : This hidden treasure of a crime drama is incredibly entertaining from beginning to end.",1
"The inmates don't take too kindly to Charlotte, either. I had a pretty good time watching it.",1
I score it 7 / 10.,1
I don´ know. I rate it 7 / 10. The store clerk from India is just too funny!,1
get real.,1
"Casey has flushed those down the drain. She doesn't know a thing. < br / > < br / > Still, it is a good movie.",1
This in fact sets what i think is the general tone for the movie.,1

"The patient has been murdering people at the hospital. With the nurses and aids, it's the same story. This is where credibility of picture becomes strained.",1
It is not a pretty picture. I loved this movie.,1
"Scott is not totally opposed to the idea - after all, hospital errors almost killed Hughes. George C. Scott is Dr. Block, one of the heads of the Manhattan Surgical Center, a major teaching hospital.",1
"This was not the case when he starred in the movie, "" The Hospital. "" ( Barnard Hughes ).",1
Same scripter. Less than 10 years later. But will she save him?,1
Absolutely corrosive!,1
That's where the comedy comes in. Still his handling of the role is unforgettable.,1
"There isn't much plot going on, but the cheapness works for the movie. First we have the delusional woman who thinks her baby doll is real.",1
I was not disappointed.,1
Certainly the highlight of this film is it's cast.,1
or 6th. The acting is superb.,1
"Nikki is on her way to meet with her girl friends Michele and Jackie. I give this movie 10 wease stars for two reasons. Another Raquel Welch Classic! Luke Askew did a fine job of playing Nikki ex husband. However, there's one problem! Michele jumps into her car and heads for Los Angeles.",1
A must see!,1
"At least on the fun level. Children at play. No, HILARIOUS! ! Nuts are humans too. And I really did find them funny. I love it.",1
Which is not here. It is worth watching.,1
Three are the main characters. Imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands? Writing about something so wonderful is completely hard. But I confess I almost did it.,1

Why can't we make films like this any more. He makes such a good headmistress.,1

Dracula told Orlock he'll be right back. 187 likes drugs. First thing's first. I have a theory though. Like Casper Van Dean gets some work. And thank god really.,1

"And then, the acting is just so amazing. Even if they were far from perfect?",1
"I first encountered Arthur Penn's "" Four Friends "" late one night on HBO. The cast is uniformly superb. You won't be disappointed. Also superb are Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence as Danilo's parents, as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith.",1
It can also be quite dramatic.,1
And Lois Smith is very interesting in her role.,1
tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a backdrop. ... that maybe someday people will wake up to.,1
Is Dr. Masters all she seems to be? The chills just jump right off the screen.,1
High recommended!,1

It was a wonderful story.,1
< br / > < br / > Highly recommended. The only sub - par performance was by one of the kids.,1
It is surprisingly funny. A must see. The execution of the story line is excellent!,1
There is never a dull moment from start to finish. The mind melting climax at the end that is just unbelievable. That's not the case here. 65.,1
Great job.,1
Well done.,1
So it is with HORSES ON MARS.,1
It is quite a beautiful film!,1
"With the two girls'help, you can probably guess what happens from there! Contrasts are marked not only with Garland's and Durbin's musical choice but also with their height, poise, and movement.",1

She was smart enough to get out at the top and make it stick.,1
"Felix Feist directed this one which was a way to promote the two talented stars to the public. < br / > < br / > The story is simple enough. Well, that day comes, and to their surprise, hardly anyone comes as the music starts.",1

"ARGH! Women will like this movie better than men. So, begrudgingly, I will rate it a 7. I am a bigger Drew Barrymore fan than she is.",1
Since it was lampooned in S. O.,1
I thought all the actors did a great job with their characters. All these people who say it is bad are too uptight and critical!,1
"Anyway, I won't get into it. We all know the fairytale. It was funny and sweet.",1

be honest! i love this movie. remember it?,1
"However, it's not lifelike.",1
"We show the world a smiling face. "" What a difference that would make! And so it was.",1
Why all the bad reviews. I also loved the ending. One of Drew's best.,1
It always makes me cry. Every single time.,1
Example - the reggae bar scene. Only problem is Josie has never been popular.,1
What's a girl to do? Go back to high school and make some necessary corrections. < br / > < br / > With Drew though it's an assignment.,1
< br / > < br / > All over - I loved it.,1
Seeing that Dinosaur with modern day special effects stalking those guys would be great! Nothing ground breaking about this but it certainly isn't ludicrous.,1
Then they will hate us.,1
amazing how some things stick in your mind after 30 years. on a Friday night.,1
< br / > < br / > Also I liked the characters in this film. The Last Dinosaur is a film that is meant to be fun and exciting. It succeeds at doing both.,1
"Stupidly beautiful. If bad movies are your thing, definitely get this one.",1
Sure the dinosaurs were guys in suits ( A Triceratops with front knees! ),1
Even BMTG banned artist Clay Aiken could belt out those lyrics and become an rump - kicking machine. Prepare to meet your Messiah - they call him Masten Thrust.,1
From that point on it becomes a battle for the girls soul.,1
"if you've really got a sense of humor. The face shows infinite torment. She lives with her parents. The poor Danila, from now on, will suffer torments of hell. His performance is, as usual, intense. The statue dates from the 15th century.",1

"I enjoyed the main character Sai. But, I was pleasantly surprised.",1
I loved it.,1
This movie is a great film.,1
I loved this movie!,1
"There are some analogies to drug addiction and loss of control, and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. I caught this movie on the Horror Channel and was quite impressed by the film's Gothic atmosphere and tone.",1
Recommended.,1
"I was, personally, blown away by how good this film was. In truth, there are no good guys or bad guys in this film.",1
Norman Reedus's performance is cool. Hehe.,1
This oddball film is worth a look.,1
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends. < br / > < br / > My 8 / 10 score is mostly for plot.,1
This one surprised me.,1

"At first, it is just a way for him to earn some money. I, being a fan of Rupert Grint, rented this film a few months ago.",1
It is only later in the movie that it all comes together. good show.,1
It is absolutely adorable.,1
My girls 4 and 6 love this show.,1
"The songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. < br / > < br / > However, viewer was not guided enough. What makes the movie great is the music and the scenery.",1
Dance is another important activity.,1
"This is not "" direct cinéma "", as a matter of fact it is its opposite.",1
"Hercules'son gets severely wounded during a lion hunt that goes awry. Ugo Filippini's robust, rousing score has a nifty majestic sweep to it. ). Of course, we also get big mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption as well.",1
It's often hard to hold on through this to watch the exciting finale. ( It should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant but pointedly critical remark on the rise of Fascism in Italy. ) Hercules the Avenger is by far the best single entry in the muscleman genre I can recall.,1
The style is artsy and chock full of symbolism. This one strays from the path but certainly worth watching!,1
"I'm still rather in shock over how good she was. You cannot take my word for it, you must see.",1
Mary Forbes is icily good as Mrs. Sedley. I love the Thackeray novel on which this film is based. That's what makes her fallen character so tragic. Bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by Loy in a film that should be seen. < br / > < br / > Loy is front and center throughout.,1
"Meow! I've never read a good review for "" Vanity Fair "" and I can't understand why.",1
"Too conceptual? And doomed. NOW you have "" Viva Variety "". It was funny as Hell.",1
"< br / > < br / > The "" hybrid "" was the mix of fact and fantasy.",1
It certainly never bores which the recent PBS and MET versions did. Nearly all of the principal music is intact and beautifully sung.,1
I loved the entire film.,1
"If anyone finds this on a home movie format please let me know. Anyway, in my opinion this version was best!",1
I understand the dissatisfaction with the final product by both families. I saw this once probably like most people my age ( 55 ) back in the 60's.,1
I love the haunting melodies of this opera by Gershwin.,1
Now I know why it has never been available.,1
I have searched for this movie for years.,1
It is my all time favorite.,1
"For we can no longer see them at their best. It was also ironically, the Gershwin's greatest shame.",1

And I fell in love with it. Pearl Bailey made me laugh. He loved it.,1
!,1
I love the singing voices. He is the ultimate meany. Not at all. They just feel... far away. It's pretty good. It is far from a ruined movie. They are perfect for this film.,1
! AN OPERA!,1
"Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their portrayals. I was in my early 20's, just graduating from college when this movie appeared. Almost every black entertainer that we white people had any knowledge of was in the movie.",1
< br / > < br / > I viewed this movie recently. The sound was excellent! I not have any negative views. Many who are no longer with us.,1

I will continue to look for it though.,1
The performances are strong and memorable.,1
Please make the film available to public.,1

I love the few peeks at the old - fashioned circus and carnival that is shown here. And meanwhile Sally is busy being pursued by handsome and rich young man, son of the man who helped grandpa get his riches. Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is delightful here - quite cute and comical in her performance.",1

Excellent movie in many aspects.,1
A beautiful film. And a good bit of wine and irony! Every day.,1
"Cassavetes is always a joy to watch, and even more so with Gena Rowlands sharing the spotlight.",1

As previously stated, the episodes air out of chronological order. Okay, let me start off by saying that, on the whole, I don't like anime very much. It'a break from formula, and it works incredibly well.",1

Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a dim - wit. There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindi Cinema. Andaz Apna Apna happens to be one of them.

"Particularly here are the four main female characters, each of varying ages and each with varying attractions to their'Yankee'man. It's almost a 180 from what'Harry'had for audiences. And there's even romance in it in between some of the rougher and more complex scenes.",1
"Mae Mercer is strongly tailored as the black maid and Jo Ann Harris is the pick of the crop from the young pupils with her seductively sly persona. Clint Eastwood as the smoothly suave, sweet talking chameleon union soldier is very impressionable and delightfully assured. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but it all comes at a price in the end. < br / > < br / > While the performances, are truly commendable and high of quality.",1

"On those terms Alexander Nevsky is fearless. Lord of the Rings fans, meet the films'grandfather, so to speak.",1
"Too glib. I confess. As said, the music of Prokofiev is magnificent. Mozart had'too many notes '? OK, you want the snaffle & bit. Stylized acting? I'll risk the nervy thorobred every time.",1

"I think of Michèle Pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as Catwoman. But given the bad reviews ( 3 out of 10 on IMDb!

There simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.

"Best watch it during the winter. < br / > < br / > Overall, its an amazing movie. All the credit goes to Tom Burton and the cast, they've done an incredible job.",1
"But still, he was a dangerous villain in fact, and he needed to be stopped.",1

Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. The sets are amazing.,1

First you have Danny DeVito who is delightfully insane as the Penguin. < br / > < br / > Cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that's taking place within it.,1
I really like Traci Lords.,1
"In what would fair up to being even more expansive, louder, dreary, and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for price of one. Camp, but well - done. Burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far ;'Batman Returns '. And his turn of Bruce Wayne was well served too. ).",1
"And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, well, as always, Christopher Walken! It is assured film - making from beginning to end. < br / > < br / > BATMAN RETURNS, more so than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. ).",1
A plan forms between both villains to destroy Gotham and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat.,1
My respect is for both directors. 'Then I thought :'who cares? This movie is not 100 % serious anyway! Hey!,1
It has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. < br / > < br / > Opinion : Batman Returns is a classic. Its not only creative but its also fun. Micheal Keaton is still sharp as Batman.,1
"Bravo Tim Burton and cast! She becomes truly fearsome. Here, instead of one villain, there are three. Why is it better?",1
"Gotham city, Batmans hunting ground, is an amazing sight to behold. she also has a tragic background. there's not much else to say here except that Keaton is simply the best actor to play Batman ever.",1
"So what is'Batman Returns ', anyway?",1

"I'd highly recommend this movie to everyone. Thank you, U. S. Coast Guard and the REAL helicopter rescue swimmers, "" So Others May Live "". You actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue.",1
So this is the last great Batman Film. You literally can't take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman. Batman Returns holds that crown. Never.,1

"Dark - yes, bizarre - no. Catwoman ( a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer! ) I really don't. I don't know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre.",1
"The world he sees is dark, gloomy, and cold. This is life seen through Bruce Wayne's eyes. Batman, for yet another Christmas, remains "" the only lonely man beast in town "". And hero doesn't get the girl - or cat. You snap.",1
"And come on, I mean we've got Michelle in leather! Trust me! He was just great and terrifying! With Batman Returns, it came pretty close! There are memorable characters, lines, and sets! Her classic moment of just meeting Batman and The Penguin "" Meow "" is classic!",1
It doesn't fit. His visual style in this film is at it's best. But Burton got away with it. This movie is the Batman phenomenon at its Zenith.,1

"The three leading men - Quinn, Sutherland and Kingsley - carry this film much further than its modest budget would have allowed with anyone else filling their shoes. < br / > < br / > 9 / 10 stars, this reviewer HIGHLY recommends it to all potential viewers!",1
I particularly liked the ending.,1
"Naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of movie. In my opinion, during the final showdown, the payoff wasn't able to match the build - up. He is borne of order and Carlos is borne of chaos. Ramirez is apparently physically identical to Carlos but mentally he is his antithesis. < br / > < br / > The movie isn't all shoot - gun - jump - around action, and that's a good thing. ).",1
There is plenty of car chase scenes and plenty of stunt men situations which I would not want to perform. Good spy film and great acting by all actors.,1
The movie was very good.,1
"The film has a great cast, starring Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. Throughout the film, Quinn must struggle with the new personality he has attained versus his own. The action is used only to propel the story of this thriller forward ; no gratuitous explosions or fight scenes. He even has to learn how to make love to a woman the way Carlos would.

This was Charlie Chaplin's first all - talking film. Watch the film for this reason alone.,1

The film is LONG overdue.,1
I give my most heartfelt praise for this fabulous and courageous story.,1
It's good beyond words. When was the suspense so exquisite and genuine? It is largesized fun. They have Kitano's ingenuity in delighting in what is pleasurable. This beauty affirming adventure cinema is an act of courage.,1

She could tackle any part.,1
Watching Irene Dunne is a delight!,1
"Not the usual WWII movie! They never miss a beat. Their scenes are very well done. He was recognizable, but that was about all. < br / > < br / > I am not as familiar with Knox's work. However, cast with Dunne and Coburn, he holds his own. She is simultaneously authentic and human, AND a charismatic, inspirational model.",1
The story was average. I like the shepherd! A Texas cop battles smugglers. Van damme was never a good actor.,1
"This little - known comedy from the hit play by Ruth Gordon is a delight. The script, based on the play, is spicy, rich, and completely undated. What a gal! Why she remains so little known is a mystery.",1
I have to question whether they should have bothered.,1
Intens.,1
They never wished to ever see such scene's again. That is the legacy of the event of Gallipoli. The lack of brutal depictions of violence are just and proper.,1

Let's hope they've cleaned it up.,1

Thanks!,1
This is a movie I can watch again and again. Especially when a lot of bad luck befalls her family.,1
Is he friend or foe?,1
The winning team would then receive a 100. I was born on may 14th 1994.,1
Bagdarasian and Karman provide the helium - like voices of the film's trio. The jokes and humour is typical chipmunk standard and the narrative is spot - on. And no chipmunk movie is complete without the odd renditions of classic rock and pop anthems.,1
Made it seem more real. One of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a Desperado rip off. Directors are paid to do a job. JCVD rocks!! I am sure he got a film that he was happy with. This stuff happens all the time.,1
I love it.,1

One of my absolute favorite childhood films.,1
"This is certainly a good film, beautifully photographed and evocatively acted.",1

It makes Jurassic Park look small weedy.,1
( Spoliers!!!!! ) Awesome job!,1
They think which color they had.,1
"The reason he does is very cool but you don't find out until the very end. This is the best direct - to - DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet. For further evidence check out "" Undisputed 2 "". Overall though, this is a solid action movie that I recommend. So run for the Damme border!",1

"The Disney Trailers looked especially bad. The CG are very lifelike, and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats shown makes it also very educational.",1
"When Jurassic Park first came out, it was revolutionary in filmaking and special effects. These dinosaurs walk, run, feed, fight, breed, hunt and swim. The amount of detail and scientific information used in this is great.",1
"For what it is, its an A! It is amazingly realistic and believable. I can't believe how much I enjoyed it!",1
Your brain will thank you. This is as good as it gets.,1
"Some basic drama, but nothing too deep.",1
I prefer the Branugh version simply because it is more complete. The quality of the sound and video is terrific. < br / > < br / > Not so in the case of WWD.,1
< br / > < br / > 10 stars.,1
An 8.,1
"That goes for the theme ( overture ) as well as all the multi - mood background ( incidental ) music. The existing series ( Popeye, Superman ) continued as if nothing at all had transpired. Early on, the finished product of Famous was indiscernible from that of the recent output by Fleischer.",1
"But wait, folks, wait. Also, the climax is typically melodramatic. 8 out of 10.",1
"Fear of his grandson's death is no excuse, he says.",1
Recommended.,1
"We don't really expect much of an amazing plot do we? I mean this is Van Damme. Next time though, add more hand to hand combat! I have never seen her before so that was a nice treat. < br / > < br / > All in all, this movie is not half bad.",1

He happens to be a Christian. Things get hairy from there. < br / > < br / > Dan's eyes are opened. Dan Burgess is a nice guy.,1
"For any other audience, I'd rate it lots lower. For that I give it a 7 out of 10 point vote. I was more reminded of a "" Chick Tract "", those little 3 "" by 5 "" gospel comic books.

But overall a decent episode.,1
"Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima ( a. k. a. "" Scorpion "" ) and this time she's out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back. The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece.",1

"All in all, I thought this film was a fine little gem, and I wondered why I had not seen it before. Instead, it relies on constant, smaller surprises. As it stands, it seems like an afterthought - a mild surprise, in fact - tacked on to the end. I found it highly creative and entertaining. This sub - plot should have been made more apparent as the story unfolded. The acting is always more restrained and subtle. It is, indeed, high praise to be compared to Robert Krasker's academy award - winning cinematography in The Third Man. This similarity strikes the viewer almost immediately.",1
"The film was produced by actor Turhan Bey. Needless to say that would be too simple. His ticket to freedom! If he gets caught it means three months in jail. What to do? Waiting at the hotel is the dead man's mistress, Joan Camden. He survives by driving a friend's cab at night. He now has an American passport and plenty of cash!",1

"No punches are held back, and the Nazis are often shown being tortured. It helps put the audience in context of the historical context. < br / > < br / > There is an intense emotion in every scene. This movie can be summed up ( albeit inadequately ) in one word : "" RAW "".",1
Lots of fun.,1

Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. < br / > < br / > War has never been been so fun. Their goal - killin'Nazi's. It isn't meant to be a documentary.

She soon gets her divorce notice from Rhe A storm comes up and they sink. We started Scarlett right after. My mother is as Gone With The Wind as one can be.",1
Scarlett now carries a secret. And... there are some big shoes to fill. It is by far the movie of all movies.,1
This is an awesome film.,1

"And then of course there'Sean Bean as the cold, calculating and not to mention, almost demonically evil Lord Fenton, Mary's nemesis and Scarlett's eventual violator. Timothy Dalton should have had no accent whatsoever, due to the fact that both Margaret Mitchell's Rhett and Gable in the film had none. < br / > < br / > It's common knowledge and has been said before : No one can ever play Scarlett and Rhett like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. < br / > < br / > Standouts in the cast are most notably Tina Kellagher ( a born actress with plenty of authenticity in her deliverance ) as the tragic victim Mary Boyle.",1
"< br / > < br / > I enjoyed the whole cast. Thankfully, someone finally did. I've always loved "" Gone With The Wind "" and have seen it numerous times. Julie Harris was her usual delightful presence, and Jean Smart was an adorable kick!",1
"They took the characters and gave them there touch. < br / > < br / > The acting in Scarlett I thought was superb. Even in the credits its based on the book, its not the book.",1
Hacker is not the hacking type.,1
Now I am no judge of cinematic techniques and acting skills.,1
It was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie.,1
"< br / > < br / > Shwaas explores, in intricate detail, the relationship between a grandparent and a child. I will surely recommend to anyone! And it does complete justice to this strong bond. Its a movie that has left a profound effect on me.",1
Shwaas is awesome!,1
I can't recommend highly enough.,1
he is astounding in his role. Ashwin Chitale as the child is a natural. $ 130000 ) budget.,1
Excellent performances. Would rate 10 / 10.,1
"Also as it goes the acting is very good, it is subtle because that is how Jayne Austen writes! and the scene at the end is beautiful.",1
Here is one of Jane Austen's movies that I found very delightful.,1
It's worth the price and worth the wait. They were believable.,1
"So it was with great anticipation that I popped the disc into my player. < br / > < br / > I wasn't disappointed, either. This is Anne Elliot, as brought to life by Anne Firbank.",1
about the importance of strength of character.,1
"The rest Sasori ). The stunningly beautiful Meiko Kaji is once again brilliant in her role of Nami Matsushima ( aka. Female Prisoner Scorpion : Beast Stable "" ( aka. "" In the equally brilliant first sequel, "" Joshuu Sasori : Dai - 41 zakkyo - bô "" Ito added more surrealism and symbolism. I absolutely worship this wonderful actress, and I'm sure I'm not the only one to do so. Topics like poverty, forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central themes of the movie.",1
The China Syndrome once again became a relevant movie. Stupidity and greed though are commodities found every day.,1
"And even if you refute that claim, you can't dispute that all humans are prone to make mistakes.",1
"< br / > < br / > It has an intelligent, believable script. Because this one scores on every level.",1
One of the best endings ever.,1
"He is simply presenting the material straightforward. It focuses on the characters and story rather than style. The China Syndrome "" is thrilling in a way no one would expect. They may be stars, but they're actors first.",1
"Syndrome "", however, is more of a thriller than a drama. The risks are simply too high.",1
It'a good movie with a pretty good ending. Douglas is an independent cameraman and Lemmon is a supervisor at a nuclear plant.,1
"Once again, our heroine is on the run. This one plays out as much more of a crime drama. But I found it to be engaging from beginning to end.",1
I doubt however it will survive the test of time.,1
I give this movie an 8 / 10.,1
The real - world accident at TMI proves the film's basic premise. < br / > < br / > There are a few technical errors. calls.,1
His facial expressions speak volumes here. I sincerely doubt that there are any conspiracies afoot there.,1
"Lemmon shines over all as Jack., his performance is highly charged drama.",1
It would have to flow against gravity the rest of the way! Don't judge a book by it's title...,1
wikipedia.,1
"I, too, loved there being no score. Trump - who cares? """,1
"As watchable as it is, it's certainly no classic.",1
It is absolutely astonishing to watch him at work. And it does.,1
Lemmon is ( as always ) excellent. Don't miss this one!,1
But he can't get anyone who works with him to believe his story.,1
"The lack of a score is perfect ; no music is needed to enhance. The writing was excellent. The entire film has that pace ; not slow or drawn - out, but deliberate.",1
"If you like movies, you won't be disappointed.",1
Should we not see how much we enjoyed it? Should we look at the final season instead of the total?,1
"This interesting storyline has all the elements for a good "" chick flick.",1
He behaved like a heel. There was no sign of that ).,1
I really enjoyed it.,1
Two identical servants scrub the floor. And very few people were named.,1
"It's the first ever, still existing attempt, to unite sight with sound. This is a pretty interesting experiment to watch.",1
"The idea was to record the song into cylinder at the same time that the camera was recording his movements. So Dickson kept experimenting and this short experiment, Kinetophone's first film, was the result.",1
"I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.",1
"These were reassembled : a playback was obtained, and the sound was digitised. < br / > < br / > But now that's changed. Sound and image are synchronised at last! The very first talking picture has returned from oblivion, and now you can hear it and see it! Go ahead!",1
"In the movie, we're told of one illegitimate child - there were 12. He was that down and out.",1
google. I agree that this film was spectacular.,1
"There are also similarities with Ron Howard's "" A Beautiful Mind "". Both achieved success in the 1950s. All these matters are emphasised in both films. The best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks to Charles'childhood. Both lost a brother in an accident during childhood.",1
"Very good! It was number 99 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers.",1
He is truly Sensational! Biographic movie.,1
Ray is an smart man as well. 1 Surround Sound.,1
A real lesson.,1
Also killing off others was bad. BUT. Bad boys. True Suspence.,1
His drug addiction and extra marital affairs are also well documented. I have to say that Jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles to life brilliantly.,1
Jamie Foxx did an incredible job playing Ray Charles. His mother also sent him to school as well.,1
Ray's biggest problem had to be the over length. < br / > < br / > Bottom Line. He even sings like Ray!. The 1st half is a lot better then the 2nd.,1
"But for a life so unique, the film seems incredibly formulaic and familiar. And surely there was more humour in his life than we're treated to here? Otherwise, we'd buy the albums.",1
"And in this film, I did. I expect more outa cinema. Why? With Jamie Foxx's performance.",1
I pick Jamie for Best Actor! He wasn't always a nice man. It worked beautifully.,1
My vote is nine.,1
Ray was a complicated man. Ray Charles was a genius.,1
Questions arise : just why are they here? Gene Roddenberry never let his fans down. Earth : The Final Conflict was proof!,1
"And nothing was sugar - coated in "" Ray. "" < br / > < br / > Recommended for everyone. The themes are carried forward with power and human dignity.",1
"Not only does it look good, it sounds good. The man had supreme confidence in himself but didn't come across as arrogant about it. Jamie Foxx does a fine job of impersonating the famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles. That's just amazing. < br / > < br / > This is a slick - looking film that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place. Also memorable was showing him beating his heroin addiction - with no help!",1
"Of the women, the only one to succeed bringing real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. A beautiful performance, and one which should have been acknowledged.",1
"We had heard much of hype before seeing the movie, but this was uncanny. < br / > < br / > Now for the big question : what are the criteria for an Oscar? Foxx WAS Ray Charles.",1
This movie touched me. Jamie Fox was outstanding. I can only dream. I plucked down $ 18.,1
During the movie he was Ray.,1
Ray Charles is unique and amazing.,1
"That was Ray Charles. The movie about his troubled life is good, not great. Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White's script follow the well - worn biopic outline. You can't have everything.",1
My wife wanted to see this movie and I grudgingly went along. < br / > < br / > I was wrong. I literally discovered myself involved in this movie during the course of viewing it.,1
Jimmie Smit performs in one of his best roles ever. There are children struggling with this world wide.,1
Truly a one of a kind show. An excellent cast too. This show was too good. So much he's dripping in it.,1
"If they had it would have run at least 3 - 5 seasons, maybe even six. From the time I saw this, after the first episode finished, I made sure that I didn't miss that time slot next week. 00. some years later, I finally found it on DVD new for $ 50. Don't forget the lover on the side!! < br / > < br / > Then I felt anger and a feeling of being let down, that show just sailed off the air. The situations were funny and serious, fast and sometimes slow, though not much it kept a good pace. It's just his Job! There was so much room for expansion, it had barely just begun.",1
"Then anonymous notes threaten more deaths, which come to pass. Margot ( or maybe Margaux ).",1
"Rating, 8.",1
And the casting was so right.,1
< br / > < br / > 7 / 10 \ 2.,1
"* It's Connery's last film. If all you Bond purists out there think I'm gonna get controversial, you're right. ). Any spare moment, Bond and his antics would be on the TV. CHARACTERIZATION!!!!!",1
This seems to refer to the 12 year hiatus in Connery's portrayal of Bond. < br / > < br / > There is some resplendent acting in this movie. Barbara Carrera is impeccable as the bizarre Fatima Blush.,1
< br / > < br / > I wouldn't trade any of the Moore pictures for this one.,1
"great theme song, though. So what? Sean Connery is the one and only 007.",1
"And tell me, how many really remember the music for Moonraker? He is fit, energetic, and obviously enjoying himself. I personally would This cast is far superior, as well.",1
This movie starred best Villian in a bond movie just behind dr no. Barbara Carrera was excellent as fatima blush.,1
Bond. ?,1
"Connery's delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was. < br / > < br / > Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her early film roles. 1983 was "" the battle of the Bonds "".",1
"Ironically, Roger Moore was a year older than Connery and Moore's Bond movies treated 007 as an active, young guy.",1
"Or was it working for less stingy producers? "" Then I shall cut out the white bread, sir, "" Bond smartly replies.",1
"B. C.'s Barry Norman how he viewed the prospect. In truth,'Octopussy'is superior in every respect. The witty title was suggested by Connery's wife Micheline.",1
"4 points. As a Bond theme, it's merely okay.",1
Check this out.,1
I will watch this one frequently.,1
< br / > < br / > Will Connery do James Bond again?,1
I guess what disappointed me was the ending. He wasn't your normal Bond villain.,1
"The star is Sean Connery, of course.",1
"( A remake of "" Dr No "" or "" Goldfinger "" might have worked better ). It falls to Bond, of course, to save the world by tracking down the missing missiles. The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon ; two rival Bond films. """,1
Definitely worth seeing.,1
Evil Ed is not just a cult movie - it's a classic! It's not even creepy. They are all about the same thing - blood and violence. That's OK. That's why this movie came as a relief.,1
Some of the actors overact.,1
"I was at my friend's house, and he had the VHS Evil Ed. Imagine yourself in his place! Very good, Nightmarish, bloody....... You just have to see it for yourself.",1
! This movie has it all and is simply hilarious.,1
At its heart its a parody and a fun one at that.,1
"it's on Netflix, i know that for sure. !",1
scene. I do miss those days. I thought I was watching a 1980s film. Maybe you thought it would be cheesy. Savor it. I do think you ought to see this. < br / > < br / > This film's biggest flaw is the quality. A man in an office who blows up his head with a grenade. ever.,1
Very enjoyable. An earthquake finishes them off. The Jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie.,1
< br / > < br / > The box at my video store is why I rented this one.,1
"Possibly the greatest movie villain not named Tony Montana. Seriously, if you don't expect a lot then you won't be disappointed.",1
It has past almost 25 years since I saw this movie. In a matter of minutes he takes you from laugh to tears.,1
He is missed.,1
But all our peasant wants to do is return home to his wife. The Nazis have different ideas.,1
The theme is very timely. I saw this movie years ago and I never forgot it. Again too bad it is not available for sale.,1
I hate wars. Do you?,1
"According to IMDb it is actually shot in France and Yugoslavia, hmmm.",1
Why not?,1
I was quite young when I first saw the movie. This movie...,1
"And although it tells a true story that takes place in WWII, it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening in Europe today. Evil is as evil does. < br / > < br / > This movie teaches a valuable lesson, and I recommend it especially to e. g. church groups or civil rights organizations. I stumbled upon this movie whilst flipping channels on the teevee late one night.",1
I caught up with this movie on TV after 30 years or more.,1
"But it's a shame that "" The 25th Hour "" isn't anywhere on the future DVD release map of MGM studios.",1
H. O. T. S. is not for those that want hardcore porn.,1
This movie is a mystery.,1
Films like this made today just don't have the same style.,1
I thought it was funny. I agree that this film achieved its goals perfectly.,1
I loved this movie especially Lisa London. So what does H. O. T. S really stand for?,1
"She was probably jealous!! Also, a memorable kissing booth ( kiss me, Clutz! ) ).",1
"I notice that there are some people who would rate this movie low, and to me that is ignorant! Unlike most skin flicks, it did have a plot. 99 rack ( in case anyone wanted to get a copy )! The only difference is that the "" Nerds "" in this movie have a much better shot at getting laid! Obviously this is not intended to win Oscars or break barriers in film.",1
"Lots of fully endowed t - shirts, vans, fighting, and a football game showdown like no other!",1
Everything seems less cynical and jaded. There's even Danny Bonnaducci of the Partridge Family.,1
"Sorry, Twilight fans. A must see.",1
! A jockstrap raid!,1
I could have done without the bumbling crooks or the bear though.,1
"It didn't. I never knew. "" Then he insists that she call him by his Christian name.",1
I've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it.,1
"It almost rates an 8. I don't want to give away the ending. If you like chic flick, see it. I think I'll watch it again tonight!",1
There is something for everyone. I love this film.,1
Really good in fact. < br / > < br / > The technical aspects are very good.,1
< br / > < br / > Almost nothing to complain about.... wait! * Warning! That's not true. It's just fantastic to watch them. You simply want to adopt him. < br / > < br / > Nimi's situation is the absolute opposite.,1
I've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it.,1
"Credit, of course, must also go to Fissy Roberts for his delightful portrayal of Sammy. The two actors were just perfect together. just brilliant. Colins words and face at the end of that scene were so delightful and said it all! He played such a lovable and cheeky child character. It kept me fixed to the TV and guessing right until the end of the film.",1
"The English are a little too evil, the Scots are a bit too < br / > < br / > heroic.",1
Definitely worth seeing.,1
"Do you really think the French or the Brits were that much nicer in their colonies? I'm not saying that bad things didn't happen. No, they weren't. Being Belgian myself, I take interest in the history of Congo.",1
It is eye - opening in its content.,1
"< br / > < br / > This is a MUST see for anyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics, and true freedom. If this user indeed watched the film, the message was that he was not communist but pigeonholed ( by none other than Belgium, the U. S., the UN, etc. ) You will not be disappointed. as a "" communist "" leader for other individuals ', corporations ', and country's political and economic gains. And this must have been quite some task. < br / > < br / > And to to think that Oliver Stone's "" JFK "" took over 3 hours, "" Lumumba "" runs under 2 hours.",1
"It is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality. And also what was going on with Tshombe and Katanga. Died a billionaire. < br / > < br / > In all it is a good movie to see.",1
"if you have the DVD version, there is also some useful historical background.",1
"And the Congolese? A must watch. When it comes to political movies I usually come out feeling empty. There were no good or bad there were just interests and conflicts of interest. I don't think anyone is bad in this film, I just think they want too much from people sick of giving and want to start taking.",1
carlylegroup. com web site fails to credit his service in the Belgian Congo. Only Lumumba's murderers believe that.,1
See my notes on Quilombo.,1

It's not!,1

Nothing is worse than the genocides of our world's history.,1
I saw the film yesterday and really enjoyed it. Maybe this was my carelessness. 'Let me go out'the key sentence of the film.,1
"There is a sense of kinship, so to speak. < br / > < br / > Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers.",1
"This film is compelling viewing. While atomic warfare has not resurfaced since 1945, other deadly after - effects have.",1
Acceptable sound.,1
"This black and white film, however sad and scary, is not without humor.",1
Almost every single building is destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Everyone forgot it. She forgot how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed. Suddenly a blinding light flashes and a thunderous blast is heard. They forget the hell of fire and go to rallies like an annual festival.,1
I repeat : a masterpiece.,1
"Genuine love, when it finally does appear, does so unexpectedly and ambiguously.",1
But this one held my interest much more than I thought it would. Pretty darn good for a French film.,1
I hope we see more him.,1
"Not that Roxane Mesquida isn't lovely and worth seeing naked! This movie is a fascinating drama about the Making of a movie. WHO IS THISIRL?? ? However, there is a pretty young stage hand who walks thru a few scenes as an extra. I think that is her in the far left edge of one of the pictures ( 2 of 9 ) here in IMDb.",1
"One can delight in the natural lighting which pervades the movie. < br / > < br / > There'more to this film than just relationships, of course. This makes it realistic and believable.",1
"Breillat observes the man in front of him even, a chaste man. But, for what is a shape of incredible exorcism, for an actor, Breillat puts many questionings. Film genre?",1
Highly recommended.,1
It made me think a lot about vulnerability and power.,1
"Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant. Jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director.",1
"We'll be seeing a LOT MORE of her work, no doubt.",1
My only complaint was that it wasn't long enough.,1
The actors did a great job. so that's what Im gonna do.,1
"And, who is it sung by?",1
also the chapters suck. i love their style.,1
"The goose who lays golden eggs. 5 stars! And my favorite, the way Jack gets rid of the giant. A lot of fun, and fun for whole family as well.",1
< br / > < br / > Watch it with your children and have a very fun evening!,1
"Its funny when he doesn't make sense. Wow, Stella Shorts are great!",1
"< br / > < br / > 7 / 10 This is decent, funny, and entertaining.",1
Most hues are orange or brown.,1
Jack and the Beanstalk was that one film.,1
He had a natural talent. I think it's very funny and original. I loved it and I still do. Very good movie.,1
There is a bunch of movies that we say must be seen twice.,1
We realize that blockbusters are not the only path. At the screening last night I witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema.,1
"< br / > < br / > The acting is top rate, especially Are Camilla and Diane really lovers or just friends? What does she signify? Lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and negates in equal measure. Is silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self - referential take on the film's status as fiction?",1
"Wow, what a strange film. In all, it's very well scored. I can't be done.",1
So I knew something didn't make sense. But I loved Wet Hot American Summer. They are equally as enjoyable as Stella itself.,1
"In some art, the beauty of it lies in its simpleness. Nothing is what it first appears to be and you're left with a real puzzle as you end up trying to put the pieces together. Every frame of this movie has importance and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time. In doing this, he creates a framework of different layers in time and of the human mind. This is not the case with Mulholland Drive, and has never been with Lynch.",1
Spoiler Alert - although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explain.,1
It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Is it because it wants to destroy his toy?,1
She has no clue who she is. Watts is terrific. It's like a dream captured on film. And the directing - hah! I love it.,1
"Even when nothing happens, it is suspenseful. Hitchcock would be proud of this movie. What an acting pair. It is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together, so you must be patient and pay attention.",1
reminiscence about life's previous escapades? mulholland drive will haunt you.,1
Only the dark - haired woman survives. The film is constructed so that meaning will always be open to interpretation.,1
This is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head. A masterpiece.,1
Diane is then awakened.,1
"And the movie executes from beginning to end the same, understated style. Still beautifully done. < br / > < br / > Then it turns out that this is more similar to "" Joe Versus the Volcano "" in theme ( not style ).",1
Sex toys included!,1
"Nobody can die in that place, but trying to certainly does hurt.",1
Perhaps I should move to Scandanavia!,1
Recommended viewing for those who like their movies complicated. A very interesting addition to the Scandavian surrealistic collection.,1
The film is a great watch very thoughtful.,1

"Driven to the edge by his lack of common senses, he feels nearly ready to kill himself.",1
But Andreas is unfulfilled with their relationship as with everything else in this world.,1
"He then enters a world different to the one he came from. What is the meaning of life? ( well, close enough ). He doesn't know how he arrived there, but a welcome sign has been erected for him. The plot predictably evolves with Andreas wanting an escape.",1
A true auteur film I find it.,1
"< br / > < br / > Fantastic. No stone of decency is left unturned. And you should follow their fine example, throw preconceptions to the wind, and prepare to laugh yourself sick. If you were ever a fan of MTV "" s "" The State, "" then these three guys will be familiar to you.",1
hell? What a great movie this was.,1
"But the next scene shows him arriving in a lonely bus into a desert. Is this a dream, or is he in paradise, or in hell?.",1
The Bothersome Man is one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. The STORY is breathtaking. But it doesn't end - he can not leave this strange world by suicide! Well done! < br / > < br / > 9 / 10 ( and I don't rate easily! ),1
But some pieces don't fit the puzzle. Is he a prisoner?,1
"< br / > < br / > This was, in truth, a fantastic introduction to contemporary Norwegian cinema for me. I'll jump right in and say it's in my opinion he's dead and has been sent to some sort of purgatory, as have all the city's inhabitants.",1
"Where the heck is Andreas ( Trond Fausa Aurvaag ), exactly? Hell?",1
"Like : a good job, a good home, a good wife, a good car, and even a good mistress.",1
It isn't. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. And I loved every minute of it.,1
! See this movie!!,1
"His quest is honorable, laudable, and precious. < br / > < br / > Breve!",1
"He has got a job, a house and clothes. At first, this city seems perfect, no death, no pain and no problems. But sure, everyone can see a film in their own way. ).",1
See it. to be happy.,1
I strongly subscribe to that.,1
"8 / 10 A true screen gem. It mostly reminds one of the ingenious FIGHT CLUB scene, in which Edward Norton walks through a mock - IKEA catalogue. Everything is neat, pleasant - well, just nice. Spiced with macabre humour, this Scandinavian laconic tale convinces on every level : story, characters, and relevance. In other words : you are in hell.",1

It is all preventable.,1
"Heck, you even get two sequels, which is the sign of a true horror film. ( Of course, some bad films get sequels, too - - did I mention "" Puppet Master ""? ) I can't. This is Horror 101 all the way.",1
if no one has seen the movies.,1
"However, for some reason or another that scenario never made it on camera.",1
< br / > < br / > Subspecies is about a family of Vampires.,1
"For what it is - straight - to - video vampire horror - "" Subspecies "" is perfectly fine. But what do you expect? That's too bad. The non - actors are flat, the subspecies are a poor special effect, and the nighttime scenes are too brightly lit. "" A totally sincere Radu is somewhat silly. < br / > < br / > But I linger too much on movie's flaws. Subspecies, "" like many other horror films, gets a raw deal on IMDb. To risk damning with faint praise... it could be a lot dumber. The script has moments of intelligence, especially when it delves into local folklore ( all bogus, I'm sure ).",1

"Thankfully, she made out ( no pu intended ) much better.",1
but her acting is extraordinary.,1
"Knowing all the lines ( and what lines! ) A. L. Diamond's script gives him plenty. < br / > < br / > For me, the film's score, written and adapted by legendary Quincy Jones is another highlight. No one could deliver a zinger like Weston, and I. by heart only enhances the enjoyment. For example : "" That's such a big, dirty, rotten lie it has class.

"Cactus Flower "" is a lovely sigh!",1
They get married and Louis shares his bank accounts with her. But Comolli is chasing Marion in France accused of murdering Julie. My vote is eight.,1
"Hawn's fashions are as tacky as Bergman's are chic. It is more linked to the era films that came before it than ones that followed. In fact, I am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirty - five years. When she's on the screen, it positively twinkles. But then again, would we have Ingrid any other way? ) ( He resembles Griffin Dunne in this film. ) A. L. Diamond's adaptation, and Ingrid Bergman's flawless performance.",1
CACTUS FLOWER is no exception. He can'r marry her : he's already married.,1

"Certainly, this improved as the mini - series progressed. Especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim. "" ( And yes, I understand... her children. I was not impressed with the Germans throughout. A fantastic adaptation. Why?",1
I highly recommend it!,1
< br / > < br / > I disagree with previous posters. I see nothing'Hitchcockian'about the film at all.,1
Each show one very clear and undeniable fact. What an awesome mini - series. The original TRAFFIK completely stole me away from anything else that was on. < br / > < br / > Drugs are worse than war.,1
"< br / > < br / > Boy, was my preconceptions wrong about this TV series. It is so much more involving than Traffic. Thank god Traffik was not that hokey and far - fetched.",1
"Other than that, this was a fine piece of work of the kind we see all too rarely. < br / > < br / > Possiblepoiler ahead. Eventually the farmer finds work, but he compromises his pride and honesty. The hardships of the family are similar to that of the rickshaw pullers family in "" City of Joy "".",1
"Highly recommended. The scenes in this show will remain with you for a long, long time. Traffik is a really well done 6 hour drama about drugs ( circa 1987 ).",1
Seeking justice for his murdered partner. Several interleaved stories are connected through the drugs trade. It is available on DVD. This really is a masterpiece.,1
"In short, Traffik is a rare work of film that handles challenging subjects with unmatched compassion clarity. It is devastating - - bleak and brutal but never apathetic.",1
"< br / > < br / > Like I say,'Traffik'isn't really about drugs. < br / > < br / > Facts, normally reassuring markers on a map, are clearly not enough - the more facts we get, the less controllable the situation seems.",1
Hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police. Great movie with uninterrupted action. Don't miss it. One can see him wanting Gary Cooper as an icon in the Frank Capra mold.,1
Also really good.,1
It is war propaganda. The chase after the real saboteur takes our young false suspect from Los Angeles to New York and to the top of the organization. That one won't fry on the old electric sparking chair. Then the rich rancher and his nest of plotters. He takes part as a gravel in the organization in the sabotage of a USS Alaska military ship when it is launched. But Hitchcock has to make it a real thriller.,1
"The two leads, admittedly, are quite weak. This not best film Hitch made, but it is surly one of his most entertaining.",1
I love this movie. You will like it.,1
"Certainly not his best, but the Master of Suspense gives us some great moments to wait for.",1
"Then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside. The sound design is almost non existent. The relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. I can recommend it, just not enthusiastically. The climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension.",1
"Lane's character here was a little lame. Don't try to make sense of it. Overall, this is entertaining and odd film.",1
!,1
See this movie if you don't see another Hitchcock film. They trail ends up in the mansion of a unlikely New York Socialite. See it and Go Bless America!,1
"Awful for the dead old man, but funny! Barry even returns a lost $ 100 bill to Fry later on... that was BIG money in 1943! We certainly do in this fine film. Hitch's trademark touches of humor are here, too. !",1
But he was unavailable. But Gary Cooper wasn't interested in doing a thriller. I thought he did his best. That is my favorite scene. And Hitchcock didn't get a Best Director Oscar for Rebecca. So role went to Robert Cummings.,1
"Well worth checking out, especially for the support roles.",1
This movie was marketed extremely well.,1
"Ah, Hitchcock! Was I wrong!",1
It shouldn't work but it does.,1
"Rushmore. It happens quickly so don't blink. In "" North by Northwest, "" of course, it's Mt.",1
"< br / > < br / > As is the norm in Hitchcock's films, nothing is as it appears. Cummings is very youthful here, and quite engaging. The villains become apparent fairly soon ; and the movie hinges more on its plot than its ironies.",1

"It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises.",1

I think that's all I can say. But there it sat for nearly ten years.,1
I thought that the interplay between Crystal and DeVito was great.,1
A modern classic. And that ending was a hoot. There isn't dull moment in it.,1
"Also starring Rob Reiner as Joel and Oprah Winfrey. You don't see the meaning of the title till much later, but you get the point of it in the first few minutes. Very, very good!",1

"Janeway from Star Trek : Voyager ). When I watched this movie when I was a kid I didn't understand the premise of Hitchcock movies, and dark comedy. He has toy train tracks, need I say more?

"Black comedy isn't always an easy sell. The resulting action is often quite funny, and even poignant. She is loud, ugly, rude, and overbearing. It's certainly never dull and often full of surprises.",1

Consistency is perhaps this movie its biggest problem. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. When Tom Hanks is playing his character more playfully and in a more comical kind of way he's just excellent.,1
"It well - written, well - acted, and well - shot. The second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war. < br / > < br / > There are, however, two complaints I have about the film. ( Not having read the book, I don't know if George Crile made the same compromise. )",1
"I kid you not. < br / > < br / > Production on this sexploitation classic is quite impressive, especially the superb cinematography.",1
His performance was by no means stunning but absolutely necessary. < br / > < br / > Well that is some of what we saw at least. In so many scenes I found myself laughing in part by the writing. < br / > < br / > The one impressive part of this movie was the writing. < br / > < br / > The directing was average to me. The dialog was put together very well and was able to let the story play out. Hoffman was the glue to this movie. She was as big of a miscast as I have ever seen. If it were not for him this movie would have crumbled and hit rock bottom.,1
"Nice to see a comedy for grown ups. Amy Adams witnesses and exist as a character, witnessing. Hoffman is superb.",1
Why should anyone care?,1
His script was a beautiful blend of humor and tragedy. What more do you want at the movies? It just wasn't the same.,1

"Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid, slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years. Fat chance, huh? He's aided, abetted and abedded by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite played by the still - slinky Julia Roberts.",1
Mike Nichols in finest form. The film is based on George Crile's fat book of the same title.,1

Not the comfort that Addicus brings with his presence. But pride from either is no answer at all. Perhaps it was inspired by this very similar movie. < br / > < br / > There's not the depth of Mockingbird here.,1

"< br / > < br / > The film has an uncommon frankness for its time and is mostly free of moralizing. That's a credit to the rich characterization of everyone else. The setting is perfectly realized. Lucas Beauchamp ( Juano Hernandez ) is something of an anomaly in this small town. It is actually filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown.",1
"They're not the faces of Hollywood extras. He's a victim and we sympathize, but he's also haughty and unfriendly. Old man Lucas is not very likable.",1
"Other Faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare. Faulkner since college, I was especially pleased to see Intruder In the Dust and for other reasons. As a fan of Wm.",1
"This is a well done action movie. I hope they make another soon. IT ISN'T SUPPOSED TO REQUIRE THOUGHT! Just meant to be enjoyed, that'all. At least RS1 had the right idea by killing him.",1
"See both films if you can. Fortunately, a young white man ( Claude Jarmin ) begins to wonder about Juano's innocence and begins seeking out the truth. The crowd could really care less about the details - - they are just hell - bent on a hanging.",1

Stevens refuses ; the case seems open and shut. Stevens is probably the single most common character in all of Faulkner's fiction.,1

This film works. I can go on and on... I see a great career ahead for Mr. Parness.,1
"The most humorous scenes are those populated by the myriad of name actors in supporting roles. Guillermo Diaz is a wanton scene stealer as delightfully frenetic oddball, Hector. Few succeed. Think more dramedy than comedy. This film is one of them.",1
I identified with not having a story book romance and liked seeing dysfunction at it's best. I like watching David Krumholtz in anything he does and have followed his career for a few years now. I question why that didn't happen.,1
Why?,1
Why does the monkey upset him so much.,1
Lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they haven't seen it.,1
Lorre is the reason that one falls into this. His quite demeanor is unnerving.,1
Laurel plays a Scottish naive young person who arrives in America in full kilt.,1

Religion is declared dead. That was quite typical of the end of the 20th century. Technically it is possible but the result is not surprising.,1
It's also a little weird. It's a good movie to see when it'raining and you're feeling down. < br / > < br / > See it with a haunted past.,1

Kiefer Sutherland shines in his egotistical med - student role. One of Schumacher'best ; highly recommended.,1

'and failed to see the artistry and psychological depth of the piece. I like my movies a bit left of center - unpredictable and fresh. 'or ` Why would medical students pull such a stupid stunt?,1
"The basic premise of Flatliners is fairly simple. < br / > < br / > Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, really shines as the lead. Flatliners recognises that people go to films to be entertained, not moralised to. I am not sure which.",1

I absolutely loved every minute of this film. I'll let you see whether they make it or not. Watch out for the inside jokes from first album!,1
"The story is every bit as absurd as it sounds, and this is not film you see if you want a real plot. I don't think so. Pick "" will make you giggle a bit... but is it worth 9 bucks? Just be sure it's your style.",1

"< br / > < br / > Melville made unique crime movies. Fate decides to join these two men to pull off a spectacular heist. They're society's unwanted, living in the night, always one step ahead of the police in a game they know they'll lose eventually. There's nothing romantic about them.",1
How good is this film? The can't make it work like he did.,1

"< br / > < br / > Once again, Melville's direction is superb. Tarantino must've seen this before making "" Reservoir Dogs "". In that department, he was one of the best.",1
Even Corey's movements involving a photograph of a woman arouse interest.,1
"And even if the remake will be made, try to avoid it before seeing great original first. Watch it.",1
No dramatic outbursts in this film. Why was Corey ( Alain Delon ) in jail? Everyone is cool all the time. THE RED CIRCLE ( Jean - Pierre Melville - France / Italy 1970 ).,1
"The score is by Eric Demarsan that emphasizes a jazzy music that accompanies most of action. < br / > < br / > Alain Delon always responded with interesting performances his appearances in Mellville's pictures. He didn't fill his pictures with a lot of dialog, as it's the case here.",1
There is a ship wreck. The man and the woman finally meet. The ending is exceptional. Nothing has happened between them. He told her his life.,1

"Slim Summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to films. To call this "" unsubtle "" would be a gross understatement.

"This movie was much better than I expected. I recommend it. Smith plays, Hitch, a date doctor. So of course, she thinks he's a pig. But, he likes Sara, so keeps going after her.",1
Besides relationships have there serious moments. Sometimes these are one of the same. Okay the formula is standard. Yes it did. Boy meets girl or in this case boys met girls.,1
Daddy will always Love you Julia. It is a curious pattern. Her messages are always very short.,1

Amber Valletta was good enough. I hope to see more of her in the future.,1
"I'm not talking about what goes on behind the camera, I'm referring to the tastes of the audience. Well, Hitch ain't that movie. And more importantly, can Hitch believe in love again? Over the past century, there have been many advances in gender equality, but not so much in the world of movies.",1
I really laughed. Being yourself.,1

I became addicted to it. I would recommend to any parent with young children to rent this movie. You're only a child once so don't let them miss out on this one! My mother taped it one day thinking I might like it. I first saw this movie when I was very little. It will trigger their imagination and provide plenty of entertainment.,1

"< br / Though he lost to Edmund Gwenn, the film was Ryan's breakthrough role. Mitchum's part was as a sergeant and friend of original suspect in the case, George Cooper. The story on which the film is based is about the killing of a gay man. It becomes just a question of getting the evidence.",1
A credit to all involved.,1

"And what would a noir be then without some attitude to go along with it? Just take a look at a shot of characters on a stairwell, the bars silhouetted against them, and see what I mean.",1
It's much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical.,1
They deserve it. And what a film! 9 / 10 on my personal scale.,1
"And the cast is excellent. Robert Mitchum is onhand as a soldier friend of the accused killer. And Robert Young, as the detective assigned to the murder, is surprisingly gritty Still, what a great noir it could have been. ( For a more genteel take on this topic, try "" The Best Years Of Our Lives. "" ( And he does. ) We don't see his attacker. But otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery.

"But it makes sense overall, and we see early on ( too early probably ) who the culprit is, and even why. Mitchum mostly plays a watered down version of what he is famous for, and the fourth known acting force, Gloria Grahame, is a great, brief, presence even if slightly dispensable. That's reason enough to watch it once and even twice.",1
"Not even anti - Semitism has been treated on screen yet. Wow. Consider 1947. The guy does a splendid job. But, okay, you have to go with the flow.",1
Very atmospheric too. But this was 1947.,1

so you have to. !,1
My anticipation was not disappointed.,1
"Too me, it's as simple as that. If you like the Bynes, you will like this film.",1
! ( lo ) so much so that I might just get it on DVD.,1
"After hearing a lot about this film, I was very happy when I finally found it. He is knocked unconscious too and has his penis cut off. Three men and a woman are making a porn film.",1
It is definite guarantee.,1
It is Antonio.,1
It pulls you into a whole bunch of crazy love stories and lies. It was also more of a chick flick than I expected but it was good. It was very funny. I think this movie will be the big break for many raising stars.,1
Go and see it!,1
"But after seeing this, I was quite surprised. ).",1
": D Well, it's true!",1
"< br / > < br / > Overall, just hilarious. "", but that's all part of the fun. In the end plot turned out pretty well.",1
"This is indeed one of best fake snuff films I have ever seen, if not the best. And I mean, in a very sick way.",1
But for the purpose of this film she is perfect!! She's probably one of the most talented comediennes out there. Not entirely... but believable enough. < br / > < br / > Amanda Bynes is a star!!,1
"! Amanda Bynes is hiious and so was David Cross. It is super funny, witty and charming.",1
"And that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it... like alluding to Shakespeare. Cinematography was excellent. < br / > < br / > Wonderful entertainment from beginning to end... check it out! Beyond that, though, this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary / traditional teen flick.",1
She is so refreshing.,1
"He turns to the camera and hitches up as if entirely pleased with his response to the crook - very cool. < br / > < br / > I got a kick out of watching Cagney in this one. One of the film's lighter moments, but you get an idea how tense people can get when they're caught cheating.",1
This is done well by all throughout. < br / > < br / > Good entertainment thoroughly enjoyable.,1
"Mae Clarke's presence lends a definite Warner's feel to the overall production. Er, fly. After all, four cents here and a quarter there add up and before we know it we have anarchy!",1
If you like Cagney you'll like this film.,1
"In end, girl breaks down and cries. You have been warned. Think of "" Flower of flesh and blood "", mix it with porn and you will get the idea. And then... it starts to happen. SFX are very good, makeup too. They untie her.",1
"Other than that, it was exquisit. Trampled Underfoot. It's either that one or'In my time of dying '. Ever seen Randy Rhoads play?",1
"< br / > < br / > After the Madison Performances, we are treated with Earl's Court. Excellent riffs like those in the songs "" Black Dog "" and "" The Ocean "" were both present. It is brilliant as always, even more so than the version on IV. < br / > < br / > In the Royal Albert Hall concert, for instance, the band had a lot of room to improvise.",1
It is SO wonderful.,1
"Again, I have seen SO many bands perform, some small - some the current'masters. And if you disagree - watch the DVD. Yup, I said it. < br / > < br / > A quick breakdown. The first of the two DVD's is where the true magic is.",1
This two disc set is incredible!,1
'In the Evening'- I never liked this on disc but it zings along here. 'Sick Again'- great piece of sleaze - rock. < br / > < br / > Plant is amazing throughout all the performances. Demonic possessions of rawk!! < br / > < br / > The magic continues into Knebworth 1979 section.,1
< br / > < br / > Viva Jimmy Page! It's absolutely spectacular!,1
"And last one is a torture scene. Sounds pretty sick, isn't it?",1
"and I was like, "" Oh yeah, watch this! "" My friend was like "" Led Zeppelin sucks! "" Held high by the followers and used as a converter for the unwashed heathens.",1
"I'm glad I did, though. The Perfect Day "" is also good.",1
Leila tries to get him to straighten out to no avail. De Mille. He takes his wife for granted.,1
I loved this film.,1
He was also very sloppy. He was so into his work that he forgot their anniversary. He goes to her and tries to bring her home.,1
I found this movie to be filled with irony. You can not have true happiness with out yourself being truly happy.,1
Who will win?,1
8 out of 10.,1

"That attention - grabbing first shot of her helps us remember who she was. For example, when we are introduced to the character of Toodles, she is shown reflected three times in a dressing table mirror.",1
"And did I saw Swanson was perfect? ). But as a story, well acted, and filmed with precision and economy, it's really a great example.",1
"As he coos to her she imagines the scenes. Cody is also good as the fake charmer who is a liar and cheat. Pure hokum but very entertaining, and Swanson looks great. To make matters worse she discovers Cody has a woman on the side ( Julia Faye ). After several confrontations and convenient meetings, things are resolved. She looks great and wears some stunning gowns.",1
< br / > < br / > My rating : * * * * out of * * * *. They'great! What doesn't change is the quality of these videos. 56 mins. It's a great watching experience.,1
This disc really deserves your attention.,1
But that is just the beginning.,1
This movie is a gem of Japanese film - making.,1
Fantastic Film.,1
It's the best movie I've watched this year!,1
"This was a great movie in all aspects. In most cases this would simply be called tectonic shifting on steroids. I really hope Shinji Higuchi will make another of such films. This how ever ran a different course. Oh and by the way, I am not Japanese, though in many ways I wish I was. Dick you should watch it with a more open heart I am Canadian, born and raised.",1
< br / > < br / > Is Nihon chinbotsu credible?,1
"It's enough to make the reader dread hearing any news about earthquakes in Japan. And you know what? Difference of opinions, I guess. Personally, I enjoyed it.",1
"Recommended. That depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. A few scenes touch on the chaos but for the most part this part of the story is barely touched on. Acting is all good as well. This made the "" exciting "" ending a bit of a drag for me.",1
"Do, take time to watch. The third and final video explains the decline and fall of Byzantium.",1
"Again and again. Belle Maman is first of all'French'whatever that means which is, of course, different things to different folks.",1
I've only known her for her music ).,1
Vijay rocks. go watch it. wow.,1
"No, me either! )",1
"NOT TO BE MISSED! Let me tell you that it was well worth it. Those eyes, that smile. I found it on ebay. Loved the lesbian Mom. Well, yes, she is.",1
Very good! Basically it starts with a happy upper - middle class family living in Victorian London.,1
They find a poor man at the station who cannot speak English. It's not long before he will play an important part in the story. Only their fortitude and good spirits are going to see them through. She begins to write stories to earn money.,1
And as for the Kindly Gentleman.,1
< br / > < br / > Actors who direct movies are often not very good at it.,1
I love it.,1
"Since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine. The dialogue "" Hi Chellam "" has really caught on with masses. Vijay is as usual very good in role of the kabaddi player.",1
"In fact, I preferred Perks on film, as he isn't as humorous in the book. The children were perfect. Bethany Cox. 10 / 10.",1
"Somewhat surprisingly, it seems to retain a significant appeal for today's children a hundred years later.",1
! This is a film that I love above all others.,1
).,1
"Consider the foul - mouthed celebrities who now "" grace "" our TV screens. Not to mention certain adults! Their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable. This wonderful film has never failed to move me.",1
My Daddy!,1
"It gets into the technology some, and reveals how certain effects were achieved. This is well - done, with tight editing. 7 / 10 You do get nice candid shots of the people, crew and actors alike.",1
and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Long trailer? you won't regret.,1
I am salivating for the sequels. ). This was just the thing.,1
( I'm a film critic! ),1
So to speak. ),1
"Prakash Raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter - weight for Vijay's role. Trisha became my personal favorite after this movie. I give it a clear 8 out of 10. The role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble. Ghillie a remake of the Telugu "" okkadu'is thankfully a clarified version of the original.",1
Parker Posey shine and is absolutely great! Which makes this film absolutely hsyterical. * * * * * / * * * * * Just a storyboard.,1
"However, my wife * hated * it.",1
A very long time.,1
"Plus the dogs are cute too. """,1
Perfect. Am an ardent Vijay fan.,1
Such dead satire is rare indeed.,1
How they do it?,1
"This film isn't a comedy, its an expose.",1
Well done.,1
Chritopher Guest is truly talented. He has a gift for humor. Someone born without a personality would laugh at this film. I almost died laughing. It is funny - dumb. BEST IN SHOW : 5 / 5.,1
"'scene, and any with Levy. Funny scenes include the'Look at me!",1
"< br / > < br / > The film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular. Clever and consistently funny. < br / > < br / > By the way, try to find this on DVD as the extras were actually worth seeing. Exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade.",1
A great actor with razor like wit. It is a film that grows on you. This movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history.,1
What a fun bunch they must be.,1
This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. < br / > < br / > I imagine the golden days of Second City were like this.,1
"It'a great movie is just fun to watch, I'd highly recommend it! It was just great and fun to watch Gerry's looks.",1
"I actually encounter wierdos like this now and then. I guess there's a freedom in having such a minimal plot. If you like Guest's stuff at all, you should definitely own this one.",1
"And... do I have to tell you the rest? Best in Show "" is, without a doubt, the best comedy of 2000. For shame, critics, for shame times two!",1
It also made me laugh. ). This was Waldo'last Our Gang short. Spanky tries many ways to make him thirsty.,1
I have to admit that I absolutely loved this movie. The unemployed critic isn't unemployed for nothing. They fly to Hollywood in search of Wolf to get him back. One day Jason is hit by Mr. Wolf ( the big bad director ).,1
Another masterpiece that needs a DVD release but some libraries have the VHS and well worth seeking out.,1
"At one point, they even consider euthanasia.",1
< br / > < br / > Its never shown on television. Its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknown.,1
Friz Freleng's'All Abir - r - r - d'is one of the best Sylvester and Tweety cartoons.,1
"The engine has either the number 651 or 814, or none at all.",1
And the chase is on.,1
"Sylvester puts his halo on and looks innocent. The cat gets mouthy with him, and pays a big price in an extremely funny manner. Tweety is sent in his cage on a train by his old - lady owner. Yeah, right.",1
!,1
£7. How can they not release this classic.,1
!,1
I was taken aback by its shear footy fun. Intercut with shots and commentary from the 70's.,1
"You can imagine it now, can't you? ).",1
This wasn't. They should do. < br / > < br / > A definite 10 / 10.,1
Do the decent thing thing. Repeat it then get it out on DVD. This can't be right for a film that has got to be the funniest thing I have ever seen.,1
Never! ?,1
PLEASE CONSIDER ONE OFHOSE!,1
But the film floats because of actors and the script. The possible weakness here is Thompson's laid - back direction.,1
"< br / > < br / > All in all, great movie. Loved seeing Jaleel White able to mock himself. The girl's got the gift. < br / > < br / > Amanda Bynes. What more can I say?",1
I don't think so.,1
7 out of 10.,1
"Watch it and remember that until this burst onto the western screens, there was no genre for it to slot into. It was unique and awesome. Delightful. We loved the sickening violence, the anguish, the testosterone.",1
< br / > < br / > There is a lot to this story.,1
"Unfortunately, the theater where I saw this was torn down. in a double feature. It never happened. This movie was the 2nd.",1
< br / > < br / > So is the film now only of historical value? Certainly not.,1
You'll enjoy the experience much more. Very good film. Enough good humor to keep adults interested.,1
"< br / > < br / > But what is all the hoopla about regarding "" Five Fingers of Death ""? Before you know it, a major setback threatens Chih - Hao's training, and his ability to represent his beloved school in the upcoming tournament.",1
"When the light shines on Chi Hao's hands as he does the Iron Fist, its pure beauty. < br / > < br / > The music was superb as well. I really loved this character.",1
"You are very bad guy! "" I was greatly entertained the second time, too.",1
"I enjoyed it here too but for different reasons. The crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. From the start, the movie made you laugh.",1
"Granted, it is not in the same vein as Under Siege, et. Probably not.",1
Who's dummy? < br / > < br / > I enjoyed the film. Everyone thinks they're a critic.,1
"< br / > < br / > Basically, this is a very good film. Watch it anyway for the fun of it.",1
So I was really surprised about this one. Cammilla Belle was just incredible. ).,1
3 ». This movie has it all. I disagree.,1
Recommended.,1
"Okay - if you're looking for a movie showing a man boxing a kangaroo, this would be the one.",1
"The dialog is highly entertaining, and Jimmy Durante is hilarious as the ship's cook, "" Ptomaine "".",1
It must have truly been hell below. It will haunt you long after you've seen this film. Very similar to Sean McClory's in Island in the Sky.,1
"Sterling Holloway creates a brief, vivid, portrait of a doomed seaman.",1
I will definitely watch it again! Travis Milloy has real talent as a writer and director.,1
It was way too melodramatic.,1
"< br / > < br / > The story line seems also familiar. The effect is exquisite. And yet, LAR is a different film, and an interesting one. And it is merely for the style it will be remembered about. There is no direct social comment, no real explanation of the background of the revolt.",1
"Unfortunately for him, he missed out on a film of tremendous beauty.",1
But the film is also a homage to the whole Nouvelle Vague canon.,1
The individual doesn't count anything at all here : he tends to disappear in the mass. < br / > < br / > The second part of the story is described in a quieter and most intimate way.,1
"This is a great movie, a must own.",1
Just enjoy it. The frames are like watching moving art.,1
"To those of you who have yet to see it, WATCH IT! I recommended completely!",1
Two young men do illegal car races.,1
"! SPOILER ALERT!! He wrote this, I swear.",1
"< br / > < br / > You won't get bored for a minute, i promise!",1
They are unique. It's a new beginning. My teacher did this movie.,1
You will definitely enjoy!,1
this movie represent me and i like it.,1
The Romanian cinema is little known out of Romania. < br / > < br / > 8 / 10 on my personal scale. It is about a lost generation.,1
"3 reasons why. The show is comic genius, most underrated show ever.",1
Another reason why he got fired. Nobody did anything to help him. He is not trustworthy. You're a plagiarist. You got that Marty?,1
I love this show! One of my favorite shows of all time.,1
?,1
< br / > < br / > The biggest annoyance i had with Vol. At least for me.,1
Total work the watch!,1
It'll be the best money you ever spend.,1
"This not only reinforces the joke, but makes it seem funnier. It also moves at a very quick pace. Family Guy is THE best show on TV. EVER. Let me tell you what makes Family Guy so funny. It uses a technique of having flashbacks occur after every joke.",1
Check it out it's funny stuff.,1
2 SEASON 3. I absolutely love this show!!!!!! ).,1
So put your morals aside and have fun with this show.,1
"It'also very funny. Trust me, I do it all the time.",1
"The show is filled with off - color humor. But "" Family Guy "" contains some great songs. But the show doesn't stop there. Not only does it spoof just about everything, it skewers its own spoofs!",1
"And they can be annoying, especially when they don't advance the story line. Thank goodness it went straight to DVD.",1
"One involves Luke Wilson. Some stunts will leave you breathless. I was, at least.",1
Jackass 3? But i mean that in a good way.,1
I laughed so hard i almost puked. Its amazing no one was killed in this movie.,1
This new one I believe exceeds the first big time.,1
Frankie Muniz is funny and Marty Wolfe is hilarious!,1
"You will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film. Keep the drinking to a minimum as well. You will witness a few recycled ones, but they're amped up.",1
"! Don't see it, and if you do see it don't post a bad review about it.",1
That's really all it is. I laughed several times. Jackass : Number Two is just gross - out crap.,1
He's nuts. No one should.,1
"Surprisingly, Jackass Number Two is even more twisted. So f * * k off.",1
How wrong was I!,1
This movie was Hilarious!,1
Go see it! !,1
I especially loved Jaleel White's cameo.,1
We've all see the countless previews and trailers.,1
"Keep your kids out of this film. But, it hasn't yet. Right? I know I did.",1
"Perhaps. < br / > < br / > Does that make me a jackass? < br / > < br / > We were not disappointed. But if it does, I could really care less.",1
Or something even worse.,1
"If not, don't bother. They'll do anything to make a stunt work.",1
Toro Totter is the greatest invention ever. then this movie will keep you intitches for it entirety.,1
( Which is actually kind of frightening. ) Johnny Knoxville has gone insane.,1
It's what you expect.,1
And it shines. Go and enjoy it for pure spectacle that it is.,1
But what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. Well it might be something like Big Fat Liar. You might just enjoy it.,1
And most probably you will too. : ) t for breakfast and Jack left town.,1
"Where do I begin? < br / > < br / > 9 / 10. "". I loved every minute of it!",1
And I loved every minute of it.,1
"As a movie, this would probably rate a 2, given it has zero plot, no structure besides randomness, and very little production value. 'He was right. It's a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the Borat movie comes out.",1
'Nuff said.,1
This brings a level of cloak and dagger romance to Speed Racer. This concept is good form of rhetoric to balance the themes and plots as they are played out from episode to episode.,1
go red and yellow!! what's great about speed racer is that you're never too old to watch it. the other cars just seemed too much.,1
This was sadly one of the shortest lived. You find yourself enchanted and compelled.,1
I love this movie.,1
It was a life changing moment for me and will alway be. I can't help it. ! But what more I have to say may spoil a future story.,1
these are great fables. just give them a shot.,1

That's crazy talk. I belong in 1940.,1
"He passes out, and she takes over the wheel, accidentally hitting and killing a bicyclist. Her Katherine is determined, sympathetic and totally lovely. This one is no different. Jean Muir is a lousy actress. At one hour and 15 minutes, this looks to have been a B movie. Ridley is there, and the two connect.",1

Good. I found this chapter a lot of fun.,1
"< br / > < br / > Best Quote : Dr. Death : "" Don't you know, my friends? It's certainly the most inventive of the Puppet Master sequels. What it lacks in gore, it makes up for with an interesting well - paced plot. Oh, and the ring - needle is cool.",1
Give it a chance. I don't understand all these bad reviews.,1
< br / > < br / > I'm glad this came out on DVD.,1
he was a very busy actor.,1
"Ming is Prince John or Aggamemnon. Zarkov is Merlin or Odysseus. Despite it's low budget, this is a great space opera. Once they reach Mongo, their problems really begin. < br / > < br / > Flash is a modern Robin Hood, Jason or Beowulf. < br / > < br / > You get the idea.",1
"It was so funny. Jason and Kaylee realized Marty isn't going to admit the truth. So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English paper into a movie! When he left the limo, he forgot one thing : his paper! When Marty hit the rear end of the masher, the masher wrecked his car!",1
I'm only a child.,1
"The world is about to end because of impending collision with Planet Mongo. They stand alone in many peoples'minds as THE example of just what a cliff hanger was. This was circa 1979 - 80.

"Wendy Crewson carries the power to drive the message home - the message that war crimes must never go unpunished. Two of the three top suspects are captured but during their trials each meets his end. Some may find film footage of corpses and prisoners and death camps too strong to watch, but they are necessary to bring home the purpose of the film. Arbour, with the keen help of her translator Pasko Odsak ( Stipe Erceg ), her staff including Keller ( Heino Ferch ) and the unexpected assistance from British Capt.",1
"The Gay Desperado "" is wonderful throughout. "" Best line? """,1
My only question is why this hasn't been released on DVD!,1
I did not watch it again until just recently. This story touches me even deeper. Who wouldn't want to be his Mrs. Boong?,1
It's a shame the miniseries is not on DVD.,1
Much better than expected.,1
The whole wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters. 10 out of 10 to that point and I've enjoyed it many times. The last hour of the 5 - hour video scrunches and mangles the last third of the book.,1
Very few of them survived.,1

Brilliant.,1

"But CHANGI isn't a war documentary - if it had have been, then the historical accuracy aspect would have been paramount. Perhaps it is for those who actually had to live through this stuff, and much worse.",1
"< br / > < br / > Stephen Curry also deserves a mention. These six stories that are told in the series are composed from real P. O. W experiences. From being a city boy, to being another nameless face to his captors. Episode Five'Eddies Birthday'is a great example of this and it really captures the Australian spirit. His performance as David in the first episode was gut wrenching.",1

I am a great fan of Hans Zimmer and this is among his very finest works. I've been finding out who I really am. < br / > < br / > In closing I cannot fail to mention the music. Where do I begin? I sat down and watched the film once and didn't know what to think.,1
That's honestly my only criticism of the film.,1
It is a wonder why this isn't hear as a classic American tale.,1
"The French Canadian accent was good, too. Horrors! I enjoyed it but didn't see any humor. What's so funny about that?",1
Especially Bobby. For the first time in a long time. So I stoped watching it for a while. I was also so impressed with the actors. With tissues. I first saw this movie as a younger child. This movie wasn't just impacting.,1
"This has to be the best movie of all time ( in my opinion ). Joseph and Elijah definitely were the stars of the movie. : ) This movie is quite sad, and some people don't understand the ending.",1
My take on the ending. Was a real nostalgia trip for me.,1
"You'll be amazed at genius contained in the film. < br / > < br / > If you will pay close attention, the message is there. The younger brother is killed by the stepfather. Although this is an interesting idea - I love the imagination used to come up with that.",1
I'm still thinking about the ending.,1

"In either case, he "" flies away "" ( c'mon, not that tough a metaphor ). But no one has even mentioned the "" s "" word so far as I have seen.",1
I'm not sure as to call this movie a children's drama or a fantasy film. A great CD to get hold of if you can. < br / > < br / > Perhaps it's because it's not just that.,1
This is a fine American classic. It has embelleshments. That makes him seem more monstrous.,1

"This romantic drama was quite a treat. But the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor. ""'Fears'will be Harrison Ford's third outing as CIA operative Jack Ryan. It's a very sharp & energetic portrayal for Pollack.",1
< br / > < br / > I would gladly pay $ 7. 50 just to watch a bald Harrison Ford mow his lawn.,1
This film is not the dead loss suggested by others.,1
"Basic of these films is development of a love. Would I be disappointment? Harrison is wooden, cold.",1
Thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception. I really don't understand that. The music is often inappropriate.,1
"Why do people need to follow the opinion of the herds of masses and critics? Even as such, the film is satisfying.",1
"Although not far, it crossed line into the "" annoying "" category. So it's difficult for me to be objective completely with respect to one of her films. < br / > < br / > I could watch her simply, say, sitting in a chair for a couple of hours.",1
A moving and well acted film with a great cast.,1
Perfect fit. I love the soundtrack.,1

Not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like this. The rules at the reformatory are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut ; step out of line and you answer personally to Warden Thompson ( Dudley Digges ).,1

"Which is, of course, what happens. Portia is one of the few notable female roles in Shakespeare's canon, and Collins is wonderful in the part. I give "" The Merchant of Venice "" an 8 / 10.",1

"It differs from ( say ) Branagh's Hamlet, which achieved new heights of faithful rendition, but otherwise offered little new. We see the Jews of the period relegated to a walled ghetto, only allowed out if wearing an identifying red cap. Such interpretation plays a vital part if audiences are to fully engage, not only intellectually but also emotionally, with the points Shakespeare wanted to make.",1
"< br / > < br / > Lynn Collins, as Portia is a happy discovery. Also, he has used a version of English that makes more sense, rather than relying on the original text. Irons gives a subtle performance. After all, he knows his ships will be returning with fortunes from abroad soon. Mr. Pacino sheds light into the character of the man who is defeated in court by a technicality. Having seen the play a few times, we were not prepared about what to expect.",1
"Bassanio, however, loves her for herself and opens the leaden casket to find the portrait within. < br / > < br / > The play is primarily a drama of hatred and revenge, but like many of Shakespeare's works there are touches of broad comedy as well. The Prince of Morocco chooses one of gold, the Prince of Aragon the one of silver and both are disappointed.

"And again. And, the suitors'trials are hilarious.",1
"To be understood it must be wrangled and tamed by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so. He is flawed not because he is a Jew, but because he is human. It would be a crime if we never got the opportunity to see what he does with King Lear. < br / > < br / > The supporting cast is noteworthy.",1

"Many have compared this to Tarantino's work. It is not even close. The three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable. The dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies. Poor Eric Balfour tried his best but with such poor material it got lost. Yawn!",0

Nicole's boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in California. Her boyfriend Jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still weren't painful enough, if you ask me. The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots. Yet, suddenly, they're being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pick - up truck.",0
This movie is so unoriginal that it is flat out boring. REST STOP may very well be the worst out of those.,0

< br / > < br / > Still it's not a completely horrible movie. And why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place.,0
We later learn that these fingers are collected for bounties. The zombies are put together quite poorly.,0
"It is, essentially, one gigantic plot hole. It looked excellent, when you take into account budget considerations. Does it fit here? They do it in other movies so I should do it here! """,0
"Good : special effects, idea for the movie. Acting is awful however. Those who left became "" hunters "".",0
"Really bad. But, as the trailer tells us, there's a problem. They are running out of zombies. The sort that wouldn't even make it onto Hollyoaks.",0

Flynn was never tried of manslaughter or murder.,0
It is not often that the casting of someone so famous is so exactly right. Pearce IS Flynn!,0
"I rarely write a panning review, but here goes. How much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars? I'm sorry, but I don't think so. Can the reference to the Austen classics'Pride and Prejudice'and'Sense and Sensibility'be anything else? I say NO to one.",0

Big waste of time.,0
he just keeps trying unfortunately. For the fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy. Why do they keep putting this sort of stuff in movies? As an horror movie this simply is a very poor one.,0
"You know, this is one of those "" Emperor's New Clothes "" films. Weirdness does not, in of itself, mean something is interesting. Well, I think that's a bunch of bologna.",0
They are wrong!,0
Hervé Hadmar doesn't. Some manage to do so with great talent. Every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater.,0
The audio is often not legible. I saw this on cable. Acting? IT IS HILARIOUS! Hmmm.,0
It has a few saving graces. He was around the area. Cut to 2006. You can skip this one.,0
"( Still, she's got the English accent off pat ).",0

Also don't expect new movie to be any better.,0
"I'd imagine the budget didn't allow the filmmakers to show it. Could it be the Fang Lady ( Justin Hamilton )? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers, who knows?",0
The movie just ticked me off. The book more accurately describes Zeena's tyrannical control of the house and of Ethan.,0

"Uhhhhhhh. Most of the time, shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing.",0

Why?,0
"Only 1 more phase until final credits! """,0
"Not even in the distance! You never find out what they want. You will 'over and over, but it is all quite simple. It is deffo more of a chiller. Did you notice that there are only six actors listed in the credits? It ain't a sci - fi because the'cosmic event'explanation is too vague to be properly taken into account.",0
I'm just glad I went on cheap tickets.,0
"God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!",0
... BREAKER MORANT and ROMPER STOMPER. I'd never heard of him and seen nothing else he's been in so perhaps he's much better at other performances. It has also given us watchable films such as BOOTMEN and THE ODD ANGRY SHOT.,0
"As it is the characters just come over looking like selfish, petulant idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them. ( usually after someone has made a faux - pas or jumped to the wrong conclusion ). Writer / Director Charles Martin's dialogue is neither witty, subtle or interesting - and there's so much of it.",0
Ha ha. He's not bad in this thoroughly comic part.,0
Who wanted to see this?,0

Subdued feelings, non - emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from Finland to Siberia! < br / > < br / > But let's start from the top.",0
An 8. Just my personal feelings I guess.,0
"What it means overdone plots make people laugh. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Simply put, it isn't there. No. The Scary Movie franchise proved that, and Oldboy proved it as well.",0
"I have seen movies with weaker plots, worse acting and so on. The ability to affect us in such ways? < br / > < br / > So why do I hate this movie über alles? Yes, it can be, but this movie not only made me sick, it made me feel violated. ... And why did he deserve this? Maybe it's because I expected something else.",0
"Wicked Little Things "" is rather tame and extremely predictable. The zombified children don't look menacing at all.",0
"This movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake. The word laughable comes to mind. Then again, maybe this film was just bad. < br / > < br / > And plot?",0
Forced plot. Forced acting. Forced takes.,0
We don't eat live animals!! This movie is rubbish.,0
"The characters are unidimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. Be smart, Homer, go for ice - cream.",0
I am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. and the graphic violence. This is a disgusting * and * ludicrous movie.,0
Psychological truth and logic are sadly missing. Absurd casting. What for? The film is rife with totally unnecessary violence. To me the film was poor entertainment primarily because of point 2. I cannot put any other construction on the ending.,0
J. S. Cardone attempts to get the horror fans back on side with shocks and gory scenes ( mostly involving kids ) but its not enough. Well I guess he felt that this one was too similar to his silly zombie fungus movie'Mortuary'and so turned this one down. Chloe Moretz is slightly better than the usual child actor. I don't blame him for it either.,0
"This movie was awful, plain and simple.",0
"Add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. By Jove, what an unholy mess! In fact there is.",0
"After watching the first 30 minutes, I became both disappointed and curious.",0
"Avoid this non - scary, pitiful little excuse.",0
"Well, Shannon Tweed turns in the movie's most professional acting job. How bad is it?",0
"There is one female rebel who is a stronger character, but she's mostly kept in the margins of the movie.",0
< br / > < br / > The reuse of extras in this movie is incredible. Note the recycled footage They must be miking their feet. Here the editors were not that clever.,0
Kill!,0
I'm still not really sure what to make of it. I was wrong. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. And then there's the ending.,0
"The Cavern is one of those. ! Oh, I see that I have to fill 10 lines or more. Pheww... one more line about a useless movie... Oh, I'm done.",0
Overall not worth wasting $ 4. 50 to rent.,0
She Can Really Hear Something.,0
but no.,0
! with Richard Kiel. It is unwatchable.,0
"I almost shed a tear when they finally "" got it ""... A tear for joy! The director, I admit was keen.",0
"2 / All the characters die ( after all, it's impossible to care about any of them ). I can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets LSD. Talk about so bad it made me laugh! I WASN'T expecting that, and it was genuinely chilling. I think the longest lasted almost two minutes. I haven't laughed this much in a long time - or seen a film so ineptly made! I < br / > < br / > All in all, a CRAP piece of film making. I swear the director used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutes.",0
Almost absurdly bad I thought. but in the end its just some dude with a fur draped over him and a mask? Showing near total blackness for half the film really brought that home. I would be willing to overlook this if great heights of suspense were reached but this was hardly the case.,0
I generally love this type of movie. This was absolutely idiotic.,0
"I was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing. There turns out to be no reason for the reporter. all I got at the end of it was a £10 coaster. They then find a picture of a kid. When they get in the cave, they can't get out and they get killed off one by one by a monster.",0
I'm still not really sure what to make of it. I was wrong. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. And then there's the ending.,0
This film is a crime against humanity.,0
AWFUL!,0
"However, The Cavern chooses instead to introduce elements that work at first, only to be negated by it's own lackluster storytelling.",0
"And what is it? Poor lighting? Maybe, maybe not. If that's the case than this should be the scariest movie made.",0
Look at the top rated films of all time for the complete list. ) We started DVD and it all started out fairly normal. ( Ex.,0
It just wasn't necessary. I can't blame what I don't like about this film on its low budget. It must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this film.,0
There's 2 scenes that may cause an unexpected jump.,0
I'm your friend. Stay away from this movie.,0
"I expect unreasonable things, like aliens, demons, or good acting! Sixth Sense does - it explains a lot. Hide and Seek did, too. Please.",0
Try to make at least one character likable. Film also requires light to work.,0
It is way to dark. It also covers up the crappyfx. Possibly the worst movie I ever saw.,0
"Way too dark in some areas. However, this movie takes that to the extreme. Dumb, dumb. Truly horrible. ( I was watching alone too ).",0
It doesn't make any sense. < br / > < br / >... one of the worst movies I've ever rented.,0
That's it. Now all of you start screaming and yelling at the top of your lungs. And boring. Everything is terrible. That's not remarkable. Making a crap movie on a HUGE budget is remarkable ( Waterworld ). It was the first clue that I was going to hate the movie.,0
"That was a surprise. It's always been called "" Scar. "" He's a fine actor, anyway.",0
"Then the camp is besieged. The rest of movie continues with even more completely illogical war scenes. Were the Vietnamese all suicidal? Is that normal behaviour? But no, they were actually muttering their script lines.",0
And it was boring. What a none eventful man he was.,0
"François murders him in the name of defending his father's honour. Indeed she appears to be angelic and beautiful. The war has not done well with him, he has changed.",0
Laughable and cheesy dialogue.,0
"Yeah, for a B - Movie it is not that bad.",0
"The character Belphégor is one of his best known creations. She has now however dropped back again to movies like this one. < br / > < br / > The editing seems totally off. The first movie got released way back in 1927, simultaneously with the novel. You can say that the movie is even a bit boring.",0
"A single mother and her two bratty, foul - mouthed kids. All they do is kill a pig, that'it. It was unbearably boring to watch. The opening scene is the only watchable scene in the whole movie.",0

"2 / 10 on the Made 4 TV Scale. < br / > < br / > It rates a 4. Maybe you will, too.",0

"Son, go start the car. Cool. Totally unbelievable movie.",0
"The scary thing is, he's actually pretty damn good in this movie. Unfortunately, nobody else does. It's your stereotypical "" moster - run - amok "" movie on a cruise ship.",0

It would have been a good film for a Leprechaun - like character. The acting is incredibly poor. < br / > < br / > Why? But at least he did show up.,0
I guess the strange growling noises coming from inside weren't a good enough deterrent either. Enough already!,0
'Chupacabra'is not a Spanish word. Then it would have been kind of scary.,0

In short poor boy needs money for stuff he wants. Serious monkey movie enthusiasts will want to rent the film for this scene alone. < br / > < br / > The story is simple enough. The chimps hit some sweet flips which is what the film needed more of.,0
Ed Wood rides again. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids.,0

This is slow suicide. Boy was I wrong!,0

I did have a good time the first 45 min.,0
I found this to be a watchable all be it very predictable movie. One did however have to suspend ones credulity on a number of occasions for the plot to work.,0
The biggest shock to this viewer was that the pre - heist scenes were not all that bad.,0
I was 11. < br / > < br / > The cinematography sucks as well.,0
"I know when you buy a used ( oops, excuse me, previously viewed ) DVD for $ 5. A back room pornographer would be ashamed to release this mess.",0
The only thing I would add is that the music in this scene is just plain annoying. It is seriously the longest wet T - shirt contest in cinema history. The film culminates in another physical fight between the sisters with a predictable ending. I couldn't state it any better.,0

"Macy does his best, but as an earlier poster commented, Miller's little parable asks us to suspend disbelief too often. If good intentions were enough to produce a good film, I would have rated the turgid, ponderous, obvious "" Focus "" a bit higher than 4. Sadly, it was an establishment owned by a Jewish family.

"The producer asked me to "" jump in "" and it was a real thrill.",0
"Other familiar faces drift through, doing little good for their resumes. Just awful. Coburn probably copped this role because, with mustache, bears a strong resemblance to Hammett.

LOL! Wouldn't a wire cage have sufficed?,0
"I figure 15 round clip, tops. Laughable would be a good term to describe this movie. Michael Pare ( a real actor!",0

"Even for the Hitchcock fan, there is little to connect with. "" Mr. and Mrs. Smith "" is one of the not too well known early American Hitchcock's movie. And that's about it!",0

"If I could give this NO STARS, I would. Well.... if you really want to feel time creep by, watch this film!",0
Had to give it ONE out of ten because rating wouldn't accept ZERO. What IS this crap? If you want t see a brilliant Gein film. PLEASE people!,0
It's a long running joke really.,0
That atlea it did : Where is the rest of this film?,0
Robert Downey Jnr is one of the many things that is wasted in the film. Oh Dear. Another reason why it falls down is that it's just so turgid.,0

Truly dissatisfying. I have never heard of a one of them.,0
I enjoy science - fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that?,0
"18, I believe.",0
The characters in these movies were based upon the crimes of Ed Gein.,0
Why are there no good reviews? It was never popular.,0
"Oh, and he's a racist. The acting was not that bad. And the POWs do their best to help. Probably better than I could do.",0
The performances are just adequate at best. Tora!,0

The plot was not good.,0

"The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. Rather, it is easier for me Also, remember the wonderful Mary Wickes?

Okay. Go see a real Japanese film.,0
The Spice Channel is more imaginative. Otherwise this is pure torture.,0
"The editing is really erratic with too many cuts. Not once but twice. Affair, rejection and separation follows. People go their own ways, seemingly. Yikes. To what purpose, one may ask? Only till the heroine forces herself upon them.",0

He should have skipped this one.,0
"he film is also graced by the participation of Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as the magistrate. It was fun to watch anyway. None of this makes any sense, but that's okay if you're not expecting any clarity or common sense. There are a couple of female roles, but they play no serious role in the action or the plot. Much as I liked seeing Wang Yu in his prime again after all these years, this one is an utter waste of time. Don't rent or buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense.",0
The fighting is average and looks very clunky.,0
Grease being the worst ever? I feel asleep.,0

It was disgusting.,0
"The production values were great, but the script could have used a little work.",0

And why did he change the scene in the basement of the house?,0
"I mean, what's the point of remaking a movie if you're not going to change * anything *? Psycho "" relies on suspense and mystery, not blood and guts.",0
The movie didpook a number of the viewers in the theater.,0

"So the film winds up with a triple personality disorder : Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet. 'sound effects - - even as homage to Hitchcock - - again, only distracted from the story. skree! And the twain, though met, shall never be bound.",0
They are horrible. Stay away. I had also seen this movie and it was terrible.,0
"I didn't have anything against Gus Van Sant before I saw this movie. Every shot, every camera angle, every nuance was PERFECT. He didn't just break the rules, he made up a whole set of new ones.",0
"What where they thinking?! I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates!",0
"Why remake such a movie to begin with? Hitch didn't write the script, you could have rewritten. After that, First, as mentioned, they did it shot for shot. Why not update the dialog? I admit I had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason. Where's originality?",0
Didn ` t they go out of fashion in the late 1960s?,0
"Don't waste your time. The original classic stands well on it's own, even after 40 years.",0
"Hitch wanted handsome and good actor and it worked just fine. Again, terrible acting. What should have looked realistic in color did not. Perkins suited well for Norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger. Same is with Anne Heche.",0
balderdash!,0
"The dialog was the same and the story the same. Why they had to make this re - make of the 1960 "" Psycho, "" I don't know. Are you kidding?",0
"< br / > < br / > The first problem is the color. Some of the performances are great. But there is one element to the character that he failed to show : the softness.

He projected a kind of clean - cut innocence : a young teen - idol type of persona. Audiences were taken by surprise to put it mildly. ).,0
"But to Gus, leave the film making the one's who KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING! This was a sin against film and on it's own, this was actually a bad movie. Vince Vaughn didn't make... let's just put it this way, film was horribly miscasted. "".",0
"It may not be Vaughn's fault. Who could match Perkins in the role? Leigh : "" Of course not.",0
"Van Sant's "" Psycho "" however, gives me pause. Why? Who dressed her? A bad joke?",0
This movie really starts strong.,0
There's no suspense because we know who the killer is & it's just a tedious wait until he gets caught at the end. There is no real attempt to get into Gein's mind with the makers giving him no more motivation than him occasionally having hallucinations of his domineering mother.,0

It's child abuse. That ain't art.,0
"I did the same last week with "" The Omen "". < br / > < br / > But this approach sort of backfired on the'95 Piranha version. So all these shortcomings really shone through with having just re - watched original as part of this double bill. The acting was worse too.",0
( Good for us horror fans! ) I won't say how because that is part of plot.,0
"< br / > < br / > Now, it wasn't all bad. She will be going places, and she deserves it. I saw this one at Sundance, and I can't figure out why it won the directing award.",0
We get it. This subject has been done to death. Drug addiction is painful to watch. Drug abuse is bad.,0
Nothing to watch here.,0
"But the story never really sparks to life. But depressing doesn't necessarily have to mean bad. Complications ensue. The whole thing has a very "" blah "" feel to it. It doesn't seem as if the movie is really going anywhere.",0

"This makes them TV hack - tors. The octopus, if it was real, was probably about a foot long and it shows. You have never seen bigger bubbles in your life. Just like on the good old STAR TREK TV series, when the bridge shakes. Maybe that's because Frankie Avalon is also along for the ride.",0
Totally unconvincing from start to finish. These days it's shown much too frequently on Fox Movie Channel or AMC. It's a comic book version of the Jules Verne novel.,0

"Unlike his other high - kicking contemporaries ( Seagal and Van Damme ) he can actually act. This film satisfies none of those fantasies very well. Are we living in 2007 or in 1957? Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review! Strange, really.",0
"< br / > < br / > not this one however. i like snipes, but this was a let - down. to start off, i'm easily pleased.",0
He is in half - blade mode here. Its cheapening the movie's look. Unstoppible was weak. Nor as thrilling as Dolph's Mechanik. But never boring. He does a credible job.,0

"I have never been in Romania, but I believe there are not many Afro - Americans in this country. < br / > < br / > The career of Wesley Snipes is downhill. My vote is four.",0
Why this movie suck? Seriously just don't. Very amateurly directed and cut. 6. Silly dialogs and too many clichés.,0
"Wesley Snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess, horribly reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest works. The movie doesn't stop to tell us what's happening, it doesn't break up the pace. The plot points are told in the context of action, on the move, while avoiding death. Oh and biological weapons. It's all kind of "" lets have a sit down and dish out some plot points for the sad bastards watching this film! """,0
But this historically wrong. Adultery and ( maybe? ) What can I say about this?,0

I especially disliked Rome's image of Cleopatra as a drug - soaked sex addict.",0
"Ugh. Truly, it was rather painful. The creators of this film did not. When Caesar attacks Munda, the battle scene is practically farcical.",0
By then the film is too far gone for any good response. He thought the reason that she was upset was because it was a kosher restaurant. < br / > < br / > The music lyrics are both absolutely terrible.,0

To be certain the film gets the details right. and its a role he inhabits to the point of disappearing. < br / > < br / > I am disappointed by the film. I've always admired the man and his unique point of view. Its masterful performance.,0
But looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never get the flavor of that dustiness.,0
Why was a joke such as this put in the film?,0
I will not be buying it despite owning most of league memorabilia. In my personal opinion it was a money spinner.,0
"Honestly awful film, bad editing, awful lighting, dire dialog and scrappy screenplay. You can't even laugh at the cheesy'ness.",0
"I was looking for more "" cheese "" and less "" cheesecake. "" And, I've seen Torgo from Manos!",0
It was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it - - tacking it on to still another film. She becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. Dunne meets a judge ( Walter Huston ) who is married but he desperately wants her.,0
"Get thee out of here! """,0
The director made this too sappy a production. Check out really good version and pass on this one. The Canterville Ghost ( 1996 ).,0
Those awful hippies ruined everything apparently.,0
"What was that for? And Herr Lipp's audition? If he could do this then why didn't they just carry on writing Royston themselves - duh?? ?ruly dreadful.... At best it would have gone straight to video, and at worst would never have been made in the first place! Or maybe that should be the other way round? He did it, and we heard nothing else whatsoever about it?",0

Glad I didn't pay to see it. The characters were very'stagey'and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce. This film wasn't gross or anything. Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.,0
Laughable. This is the character of Aeon Flux.,0
The flawless artistic action involved? That's it. The cranky drawing style?,0
"Flux only really succeed in failing. This is the story of her fight for justice, freedom and revenge. Jamie Foxx takes a nosedive as a pilot in the dull Stealth after scooping a gong for Ray.",0
The plot is recycled sci - fi fodder.,0
"The costumes are little weird but still look nice and interesting. There's no humor and the film becomes a little boring at times. It may be a disappointing film but it's an average film at best. So, the movie may be a case of style over substance. The acting was alright, nothing special.",0
"Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia.",0

"The cad. This is a WESTERN, for crying out loud! Have a look at the outfits.",0
Too many clichés and too little depth to the characters.,0
"I like good light hearted romantic comedy but this was just bland. It's not a terrible movie, you just won't miss anything by not watching this movie.",0
And again. A massive disappointment.,0
"Instead, I was bored and a little depressed. I expected some light fluffy fun.",0
Just a waste of movie time.,0
"Yes, I spelled that right. The romance was tepid and the laughs were weak and few.",0
"Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actress but this wasn't her film. The food, the characters - nothing felt passionate. No reservations felt like it never connected. What a disappointment.",0

"However, i spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin.",0
But the instigations of the fights were totally absurd! I am giving this movie way too much credit! < br / > < br / > This movie's story line was onion skin thin. The dubbing was literally the worst I have ever heard. This is the only Kung Fu movie!,0
The scenery and the training sequences in the river are a little different from usual. The film mentions another director Wu Yuen Ling as well as the one IMDb lists.,0

This is a movie for the most immature people. Then grandpa moves in and the dog comes along. Junior and his dad start a new life in a new town.,0

"My biggest pet peeve is when directors let their private fetishes interfere with truth of their movie, and this to me was a supreme example.

The big dodgy rat - thing is a real hoot to see.,0
"3 out of 10 for an OK story.. this sucks. The story are good, but it doesn't carry the film, no wonder it has a low rating over all. this is better as a book. the make up on the vampires is poorly done, and the effects are worse.",0
"Yes, so it does!",0
Not the worst film ever but hardly the best either.,0
This movie was one of a handful that actually caused me pain. Painful pitiful mess. I was embarrassed.,0

"Vertigo is thus far my hands down favorite while Saboteur is easily the worst. If you must watch it, then rent or borrow. I've seen about 10 other Hitch movies from the 30's - 60's. Hitchcock is like the John Coltrane of directors. Personally, I rated it less than half that.",0
Since when can a fan belt cut through handcuffs? It takes true genius to scare generations of film goers out of taking showers and wearing neck ties. ! Nobody recognizes him... his face is on EVERY NEWSPAPER!! Without going into any great depth here is a list of a few of this films major problems : < br / > < br / > 1.,0
The sequence at the villain's lovely ranch?,0

"Cue some guff about Bill Hicks, and Howard Marks ad nausea. The words "" Jack of all trades, master of none "" come to mind.",0
I condemn it to the ash heap of history and pray it stays there.,0
The battle scenes are overlong and moreover pathetically staged.,0
"When she learns he has been murdered, she decides she will bring the killer to justice in a fashion only she can. Well, there's really nothing wrong with the basic premise as a starting base for a martial arts / blaxploitation action thriller, which is what this aims to be. < br / > < br / > Sounds good, doesn't it. Where this fails miserably is in terms of the fighting action it offers up.",0
"( Again, I will admit that this is very much in the tradition of Shaw Brother quickies since time immemorial ). There's a semi - dodgy sex scene that manages to be effective almost in spite of itself. < br / > < br / > This one is strictly for hardcore fans of blaxploitation. TNT Jackson "" isn't completely unwatchable. I will admit, they are quite nice. Or maybe both.",0
You know one ; it was made famous by... Jimmy Dean. Cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment.,0
truly awful.,0
"Doesn't this seem somewhat familiar? 4 / Personally I would exorcised the role, as a mark of respect to him. Sad, really. Is it for the benefit of the Americans who haven't seen the programme? Did the scriptwriters run out of inspiration?",0
I came away bitterly disappointed. It simply wasn't the same. Its just a shame the film isn't worthy of their talents.,0
"No, thanks. That is entertainment?",0
Many parts were seen before in the TV Series. 8 / 10,0
"RIP. Were they that cynical, or just too desperate to be in film business?",0
It looks like a pitiful attempt at humor. Each performer acts well enough to play off of. It works pretty well.,0
The funny parts were very few and far between. Asterix and the Great Crossing & Asterix and the Normans. All this ended up doing was create a childishly immature storyline. I've been proved right again.,0
"Well, definitely, Asterix is not made to move! Not the music, but the few stills it contains. ).",0
The Vikings get all the best ones.,0
They annoyed me to no end. This was waste of time. 9 / 10. There were'jokes'that weren't funny.,0
I think it's the first time that I go inside a theater and go out so disappointed. They took animation studios from numerous countries and they still can < br / > < br / > Imagine. But the new ideas simply crashes it in a bottomless pit. < br / > < br / > The similarities end here. It's simply a big animated mess and it proves that the Astérix franchise is going from bad to worse.,0

The little boy was very good. A good idea let down by heavy - handed production.,0
"Guess who's playing this minor role, yup!",0
"All in all, there would surely not be many takers for this film. Homosexuality and Lesbianism are not of any consequences here.",0
"Gust, in the book, is hard core and completely free to speak his mind. In short, the movie is too bland, and the history is too old for our modern time.",0
"Aaron Sorkin... OMG, not a chance. Tom Hanks... nothing. The rest of you, beware.",0
As if she's Nancy Reagan to his Ronnie.,0
"Oh, man, they sure knew how to make them back then. All in all, a great disappointment.",0

"So our little epic is both dumb and dated. The rest of the movie consists mostly of chases. I'd still think that if I hadn't seen certain movies on MST3K since then. < br / > < br Yeah, that makes tons of sense. There'talk of how Splatter became a freak due to radiation. This thing is a real stinker. FUTURE KILL is a waste of time that nobody needs. The other half, it turns out, are all punk kids who dance around to a bad 80s pop - band.",0
"So I give it one star for true quality, but I'd give it an eight and a half for sheer enjoyability. Wonderful stuff. < br / > < br / > It's hilarious, non - stop fun, apart from the very unpleasant rape scene, and is essential viewing to any serious bad movie fan.

At least there isn't much to sit through since its less than 90 minutes. The film is directed by Simon West and he is really bad at building up suspense. He has to be one of the lamest killers ever. Why did they hire this girl? He carried no weapons and didn't seem to pose much of a threat.,0
Really bad. By far the best part of the movie is the house it takes place in. Which is not saying much for the actual movie. This movie is bad.,0
"Hard to tell, or care, really. I will admit that I dozed off at some point during this, and did I miss anything? The children are already nestled all snug in their beds when Jill arrives, and the housekeeper is still there, huh, she couldn't babysit?",0

"Oddly, he keeps none of this a secret from her. He would be able to see exactly nothing. A certain rest in peace.",0
Because he is shy? To kiss me? Why?,0
Both have excellent cinematography. The episode is a rich topic for debate.,0
"Tommy, superb on trombone, and Jimmy, superb on saxophone, usually couldn't stand each other. Each had greater success alone than they had achieved together. Tommy was hugely talented and, from all accounts, often an overbearing jerk. My copy has only four chapter stops. Jimmy died of cancer at 53 in 1957. Why spend a moment slogging through this awkward and self - conscious movie? In 1935 they finally split, with Tommy starting his own orchestra. They reconciled when their father died in the Forties, which is where the movie ends.",0
"Unfortunately, he is in the majority of the film's scenes. Clifton Webb is one of my favorites.",0
Nothing much happens in this film. So if you'male I don't recommend this film to you. This is more of a Chick Flick than anything else.,0
"At least, that's the hope. We get many, many musical montages which telegraph how we're suppose to feel. B - sides, anyone?",0
"It has become almost a safe option. The subject matter could be an interesting basis for a film. However, the delivery of this appeared naive and unfocused. There is a lot of talent here in the UK.",0

and it was absolutely horrible.,0
"In fact, I'm sick of violence. Why was the dialogue so juvenile?",0

"His sick mind wouldn't have allowed it. Those are not Dominicans! I know, it's a movie. The Spanish dialogs with the Cuban accent are horrible! So what happened here? I prefer the leading actress in "" Deep Blue Sea "".",0
I don't think this is that original a plot and it doesn't go out of it's way to make itself anything more.,0
"Menace "" is not funny. It tries hard - too hard. How funny is that?",0
The jokes are racist. Don't be a menace is an example of this.,0
I laughed a handful of times.,0
I don't understand the humor in this film.,0
The storyline is seriously all over the place. < br / > < br / > I laughed perhaps once at the most.,0
Who would have thought it? Ewww!,0
"The movie is a dumbed - down, completely different take on Frankie Machine and drug addiction. The acting is decent, especially the snakelike Louie, who is more menacing in the movie than the book. And drug addiction is treated as shlock, exploitavely. When this happens, Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow, all lose their psychological edge. And it should have remained the only story of Division Street and Frankie Machine.",0
My suggestion to you : WATCH SOME BEAUTIFUL CINEMAS MADE AROUND THE GLOBE.,0
I was extremely disappointed and shocked at how thrown together this film was. Kronks New Groove in all honesty did nothing for me nor my girlfriend and we both loved the first. < br / > < br / > Buy at Own Risk.,0
"In this movie, Kronk learns a great deal of lessons at many others'expenses. This all leads up to Kronk confronting his father and his disapproval over his son's direction in life.",0
It was not.,0
"Hoped it would be as good as the first one, but...",0
"To save the day, a little help from his friends.",0
There's almost no humor targeted towards adults. ... but of course I was wrong. The original songs are uninspired and sickly cute.,0
"This is the story of a maniac cop who, for some reason, has it in for a young college stud and his mates. Only, they get locked in the store, along with the weirdo.",0
It's ill focused and lazily written.,0
"There are plenty of better horror films featuring snakes as the aggressors than SNAKE ISLAND. The other cast members serve as either tourists or crew, mostly fodder for the snakes. Kate Connor is Crawford's attractive love interest, a lawyer on vacation. That's a no - no for a genre such as this.",0
Now we know where they got the idea of Snakes on a Plane. Do not pay to rent this.,0
"Did your draw drop again? These aren't mutant snakes. And while they dance nude and such, the snakes hunting them all of a sudden stop and start jamming along to it.",0
"Just, "" It's bad. "" Oh, they never do get gas by the way. Don't waste your time.",0
"< br / > < br / > The characters are so unlikeable I was begging for the snakes to finish these horrible people off to put us all out of our misery. That is one thing I will give this movie, there are snakes, LOTS and LOTS of snakes of all sizes and kinds.",0
Snake Island is the other kind of bad.,0
< br / > < br / > Come on Nick. The drama is at a minimum. 1 ) The Boarding School is perfect. Mini fridges. Lets give that a reality check.,0
"That's not funny! Dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is just plain mean. That's mean and it just influences young girls to act mean to totally nice people. That raw plot line is, I'll admit, a pretty good idea. Chase and Michael are very similar, and I even sometimes get them confused.",0
I couldn't bring my self to sit through 3 episodes of Zoey101. What message does this show bring to kids?,0
really! I strongly dislike this show.,0
"The characters. < br / > < br / > Don't even get me started on Jamie Lynn's role as ZOEY. Are. The boys want to ask her out, the girls want to be her friend, etc. Most annoying of all : her voice is so darn bubbly and obnoxious. "" < br / > < br / > Take for example the first episode.",0
"As is the tradition amongst kids networks, the cast is an array of skinny white kids, with the token black guy, of course. The few words I spent on each of these characters sum up each character entirely.",0
This show sucks.,0
BORING!!! ?,0
Sounds more like a villain to me! A SUSHI BAR.,0
This show is very annoying. But that is not the worst. Moving on.,0
"Oh, and it's in Malibu. Too bad none of this makes her likable.",0
What happened to Dan Schneider?,0
"This television show is stereotypical and far - fetched in many of its aspects. < br / > < br / > Next, the characters. First of all, I just don't understand Zoey's character.",0
Now let's talk about the show. You can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is!,0
"The kids in this show are rarely seen in class and there doesn't seem to be any real teachers. I've been through school and I can tell you, nobody is like that. Chase is dumb. Lola is a clone of Nicole. A sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat screen TVs in every room, cool dorms to hang out, etc. Why not use some originality? Each character is a stereotype. There is nothing here to be amazed or surprised at.",0
"Sorry, it's too mature and yet too dumbed down. I've seen this programme a few times and the more a see of it, the less I like it.",0
What caused the catastrophe? I have no idea.,0
The acting is horrible. 3.,0
"It could not get any more diabolic than this. Right, where do I start? Both left the show in seasons 2 and 1 respectively, not that I blame that.",0
< br / > < br / > This show is big thumbs down. She is always perfect at everything including her perfect figure. No one is that rich and lives at a dorm off the pacific coast. Might as well shave off the hair chase.,0
"I think no. She is so perfect. The plots are pointless, and incredibly boring. It is so annoying. Chase is such a wimp. How pathetic.",0
"Just as its true that no Iraqi people have control of their most prized oil and US corporations do. Its true that some Iraqis actually get paid a good wage. Nor does it mention that 20, 000 civilians have died due exclusively to US artillery. Well there's a few things about this movie. I am afraid that the cutting room floor Everyone should see it. I agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this film shows that same distortion. Still 15 % of the country which once had running water and electiricity now does not.",0
Something so simple as a Google search.,0
"It's ugly stuff because the values, the ideals, of the screenplay are all so harmful. HUH? < br / > < br / > c ) the underlying legal assumptions are nonsense.",0
"He's a hit - man in other words. A small part in a major movie would be of more benefit to him than this rubbish. Why does he pick stuff like this? Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too. Look at Cruise today!!!",0
"In short, don't waste your time.",0
It is a tale like CAMILLE. What were they thinking?,0
I was completely disappointed.,0
"The cinematography is poor, and the acting even more so. But to me it just gives me a feeling of indifference. But it isn't successful.",0
"does not. The guy mentioned to sue for the 1. To think of a man who actually wrote this story, sick. If you ever saw the movies saw?",0
I couldn't be further from the truth. Like jumping off of building. 00 and told them to make a movie.,0
Fearful survival. Dark and dank basement.,0
Talk about a poor memory!,0
Especially ones with lots of unnecessary nudity. This is definitely a film without motive that was shot poorly and very drawn out.,0
5 hours of my life back.,0
All you know that its a basement somewhere. I wanna see some stuff in a movie. You couldn't really make out what was going on. ! Then you will hear the girl sobbing. The not the best movie in the world???? That was an understatement.,0
Billy Bob from Silence of the Lambs treated his victims better than Netwon. Huston was obviously trying too hard and if anything it resembled a bad film school project. Having to result to camera and lighting the way he did was a sign of over the top syndrome. < br / > < br / > The story is good. The sound is muffled and often times not understandable.,0
Why?,0
The budget does really show - which in this day and age should not.,0
"Taylor is embarrassing. Misguided, miscast, murky, interminable lunacy given the high - gloss MGM A - budget treatment. End result : Metro's "" Parnell "" of 1940s. Louis B. Mayer forgot to tell Vincent Minnelli he was directing a thriller, not a musical.",0
She soon finds out there is a lot she does not know about him. Minnelli never really succeeds in getting Kate to defer in desperate fashion to Taylor's limited abilities as an actor. Talk about piling on. Her attempts come across as silent Gish while Taylor's wide descent into madness takes on restrained Bela Lugosi. Robert Mitchum completes the miscasting as the sensitive brother.,0
#NAME?,0
The directing style has been done to death ( The fisheye camera ).,0
But that is where this movie goes no further! Are they ghosts? Why? The story is even worse.,0
The acting was flat and the story lacked depth.,0

I want my 82 minutes back. Wow.. where do I begin.,0
The problem is Val is really only in one scene. Wow! Gallo is amazing in it. I have only seen Stranded of the directors other films.,0
I don't know how films like this get released Video or Pay Channel. I am disappointed in Vincent Gallo. If they had a Zero out of 10 I would of entered it. It is like Marlon Brando in Superman.,0
From hell.,0
"Yes, this movie is a horror. Horrifyingly bad. Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back!",0
The gate to Hell has opened up under Moscow.,0
"It's dark, and it's mystical and murky. This line is a good summary of this movie. Could they have find a more boring plot?",0
It's simply nonsense and proves the lack of talent of director. His character don't have specific weight in the movie. What a mistake!,0
"In truth, the character resembles a drag queen, not someone in the midst of transitioning. I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that. Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least. Some spoilers * * * * A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it.",0
Sit in your basement with the light out for an hour and a half.,0
Keep your money sanity and keep well clear.,0

"In fact, make that a couple of roofs. You'll understand why director Nathan Juran changed his name to Nathan Hertz on the credits. Haaaarrrryyy! "" The confrontation turns ugly.",0
"Who knows. The seem low on budget, originality, and plot. Thankfully he is a decent actor and a pleasure to watch.",0
"But wait, there's worse news! This is pretty much it for the plot.",0
"I feel I should be congratulated. If you have to see it you will understand why. This movie is, in all likelihood, the worst film ever made.",0
"Terrible, terrible, terrible! It was laughable.",0
"There is nothing even remotely interesting in this piece of crap. No gore, no suspense - just gigantic boredom. Avoid this horrible junk like the plague.",0
Its keeper!,0

"True, the film has plenty of action, but asks the viewer to suspend belief.",0

The acting is very wooden although many of the cast names can definitely do better. I love Juan Piquer - Simón!,0

The problem is the story.,0
This seemed very silly to me.,0
< br / > < br / > Every episode is also too much of a stand - alone. I honestly fail to understand why people love this show so much. This show is like a collection of'sci - fi'leftovers. The acting is also quite bad.,0

This is thanks to many talented but pretty much unrecognized Black performers. A very interesting and funny time capsule.,0

I can safely say some people are hyping up this frankly dull movie. < br / > < br / > The film is not at all the worst thing i've seen but it seems completely overrated.,0
Unattractive material given sitcom handling ; it starts off on the wrong foot and never recovers. ).,0

Of course none of this is ever explained as doing so would require some sign of logical analysis from the writers of the screenplay. So add some stars to the rating if you are watching the MST3K version. What they find on that planet are the remnants of a human - like civilization devastated by an atomic war.,0

Gore doesn't trump fun or originality. This sucked.,0
To save money on costumes and sets. The only thing this one has going for it is the animals which are not as prevalent in this one as they were in the last. Well I guess I can figure why they did in fact place nearly all the movie in modern times in this and that movie.,0
1980's horror is the past and should stay in the past. The jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible.,0
The same can be said for Tony Todd. The alligator attack seen was shoot too dark.,0
Sorry. Honestly my money is on Rob Zombie.,0
this movie had no point.,0
"Arghhhh! the only reason i gave it a 4 was because of the gore which was actually the only thing that i watched this movie to the end for, that and to watch them all get killed. i mean it was just way too retarded, it was like the writer didn't know where he wanted the story to go.",0
It thankfully stays away from Torture Horror. Creature effects and make - up are silly - probably on purpose. It's between SHAUN OF THE DEAD and LESLIE VERNON. HATCHET is a movie of betweenness.,0

The ending song sounds like it was more suitable to a western movie. That would be my review if it weren't for the minimum of 10 lines.,0
At the start of the movie all characters are wearing 1930's clothes. Then there's the weird costume choices.,0
"Like any genre, they have their outright masterpieces, as well as their absolute turkeys. It's like The Blue Angel plus a kid. There is nothing wrong with that in itself ; as an actress she was up to the part. As usual Sternberg's interiors are dressed and shot to look like either brothels or insane asylums. It's just that nothing else about the format has changed. Time to send Blonde Venus back to the farm.",0
In fact I've been in some towns where they're downright ugly.,0

The word limit prevents me from continuing the list. It is clear then that the Dower House is far too big. The average would include the sets. Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak. Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana. The screenplay.,0
I was so confused that I was waiting for the punchline. And why force her to talk like that?,0

Cameron Mitchell is the journalist and is affable if nothing else. Marguerite Chapman is beautiful in very short shorts but adds little acting range.

Gamera vs Viras was made lazily and much of it suffers as a result. Talk about showing the battles in non chronological order. SO overall this is not a bad monster for Gamera to fight and is decent.

Why did they even make a movie like this? There are many of those. Did this have anything to say?,0
The direction is poorly misled by quirky shots. The acting doesn't seem to flow and contribute to what characters are feeling. Unforgiven is Clint Eastwoods last tribute to the once great west.,0
Then there's the anti - Western Western plot. He is not and never has been a leading man. It was way too slow. Here he plays a retired tough guy.,0

"First of all, there was nothing humorous in the least bit. What I got going in with that expectation was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, bar none.",0

I actually quite like some aspects of it. Windscar deflects. Let me state this right from the start. Enemy turns out to have barrier. Many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it.",0

"Mumbling voices was the end result, and the cinematography was average to fair at best.",0
absolute rubish. WOW. I cant believe how bad it was.,0
This is mise - en - scene. Maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a terrible film. It is the difference between say John Ford and Sam Wood.,0
People fighting doesn't make any sense. Everything else just plain sucks. New Zealand looks awesome.,0

No seriously it was.,0
Who was supposed to be dancing? Yuck. This is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup. How sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. She also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. I found Alex extremely repellent.,0

The film was misguided and highlighted the youth of the production team. The first hour is just one cliché after another.,0
I say either do a great job or just leave it to some one who knows how. It is more like an uninformed contemporary view of what is was like. This government funded film is just another failure by Australia's wealthy and spoilt rich kids.,0

Blah blah blah.,0
"This film sadly compromised in quality by miscasts, appalling accents and woeful acting. As his voice provides the stories narration it is something that after ten minutes was driving me nuts. Roland Manookian and Frank Harper provide the films only source of authenticity.",0

"This isn't Goodfellas despite the blurb on the DVD cover. Why? This "" True Life "" story of Carlton Leach ( who? )",0

As a result the movie remains shallow as a whole. Violence resulting from paranoia and fear in general. This movie could have been great. It is not in my opinion. It is hard to identify with the main character.,0

Totally predictable from start to end.,0

"Come on, at least you could let them develop their relationship a bit first. I wasted 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before I gave up.",0
The plot is pretty faulty and dialog rather sad. when trying to be scary.,0
"You turn my tears into wine, "" is a sample gem. The actor deserves an Oscar for delivering that one with a straight face. The dialog is a treat for connoisseurs of bad writing. """,0
Travolta is no longer the King of Cool but the King of Corn.,0
But it never came through.,0

Guess what?,0
"This is worse. The Rock, Andre 3000, and Vince Vaughn were in a comedy.",0
Wait for DVD.,0
Ho - hum. Travolta looks old here. I'm a fan of Get Shorty.,0
His performance is kind of dull though. John Travolta returns as Chili and he does an okay job. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. He just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of mess. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't.,0
Wrong. Andre 3000 - Sucked but he went down swinging. It felt like he was slumming. John Travolta - Very likable.,0
"I, for one, was completely captured by the diverse characters and crisp dialogue of the original.",0
Get Shorty was an excellent film. And even Chili doesn't seem to know what's going on. Is she supposed to be ditzy or clever?,0
This was painful!,0
"To them, he looks like a giant. < br / > < br / > Harris is left to carry the entire film here.",0
"Also why did they tie it in with Cyborg anyway? Another aspect is the terrible acting. ( Okay so, Cyborg 3's cast isn't that impressive. )",0
"< br / > < br / > As an adaptation to the novel, this movie was total suck - fest. But alas! < br / > < br / > It rates a 4. This movie failed miserably to live up to its potential.",0

"Thanks, dude! ) Ironically, it's even _ about _ two garbagemen.",0
"< br / > < br / > This film is dreadful, and it shows its age. < br / > < br / > There is good trash and bad trash.",0

So I was expecting the worst. It's all dream.,0

"First things first - though I believe Joel Schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often ( as here ) downright bad, the lion's share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a film must go to John Grisham whose novel this is based on. Peter Menzies lush, 50s Technicolor cinematography is pretty but derivative. < the 70s?",0
"The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ends up advocating vigilante justice.",0
"Carl Lee Hailey was a vigilante. And oh, by the way, the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in Mississippi, complete with hooded KKK men burning crosses. Yes, there were mitigating circumstances for what he did, but fact remains that he wasn't innocent. We're supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. Namely, "" A Time To Kill "" sets you up.",0
Shame on them. This is the worst kind of film. Are black people universally inspiring? Do juries really acquit people of murder because they feel sorry for them? Is it really subject that belongs in Hollywood hands?,0
"The jokes aren't funny enough! But I just couldn't. So what is left to be enjoyed. It had to be as the action it self never is exciting. Waste of time! Red Shadow "" is just silly! ) Well, music ( techno ) was uplifting. ( I've seen my share of Japanese movies.",0

Nothing!,0
"If you have, I pity you.",0

"Then you have to get high / drunk and watch. For awhile I was hooked on shows like Ghost Hunters and Destination Truth and stuff, even though I thought they were full of crap I found them interesting and entertaining, and that's why we watch entertainment TV. The show is frankly insulting to the intelligence to the viewer. They've probably read the Wikipedia article on exorcisms. "" This one is too much for us.",0

All you care about is producing a movie where people get sliced and diced by a homicidal Indian spirit / creature / legend / whatever. All I ask And quite honestly, I think you do it just to antagonize me. So we throw you bone, because we're not looking for Oscar - winning performances, intriguing plot or realistic character reactions to the situations at hand.

Oh, and the horses also change as the Skeleton Man freely moves through the forest from that portal. Just unbelievable horrible. The film's point - of - view through the Skeleton Man's eyes looks at his prey with a different color. Rooker deserves better than this.",0
"This is utter trash. That's no spoiler... A lot of badness is in the editing. It's not a B movie, it's a "" D movie "" at best. It serves no real purpose, either.",0

It doesn't matter. He wants beans. They Skeletor attacks again. The bullets cause sparks to fly from the trees. Where to start? Wouldn't they have probably done that when they first met? Then everybody starts shooting.,0
None of them are too bright. I'm amazed that junk like this gets produced.,0

He is also fascinating. But I also thought Redford's character was a bit of a wimp. That wasn't really the point of the book. It was almost like seeing a completely different movie. SPOILERS THROUGHOUT : < br / > < br / > Not good.,0

This is an extremely competent movie technically. I strongly doubt the real - life Marquis de Sade would have recognized this character at all!,0
Why should we care? I'm at a loss. What's his deal? Who were they trying to kid? Why didn't you follow that story? I watched because of Lee and Jay. I was completely put off by the film. It just made no sense. The actor who played him was great.,0

It's not Drake however who's dead, but his secretary Austin Winters ( Grant Mitchell ). Potential viewers be warned, the current IMDb viewer rating for "" Tomorrow at Seven "" is an anomaly of low voter turnout.

Also camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others. Why does C Thomas Howell do these movies? The set - ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad. There is no comparison. Look at his performance in The Hitcher and compare it to this movie. Hysterical. Production Values - I'll start with the good stuff. < br / > < br / > Script - Terrible.,0

The rest of the crew is almost as bad... save for Winona Ryder, who does her best with the crappy lines given to her. A charismatic and interesting artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves better and I hope he took the 500. The otherwise fine actor Dennis Quaid is putting on what must be one of the worst performances of an actor in many a moon! Add to this a bunch of actors who doesn't know if they are participating in a drama, comedy or a little bit of both! And it's a damn shame!",0
"That is why this really can't be classified as a biopic, but more of a inaccurate news reel. 1 and so on. Just re - saw this last night and to put it bluntly : "" Style instead of substance "". Absolutely, no basis in reality. Cut to a scene where he first meets his second cousin, Myra.",0

This is a "" buddy movie "" and, at times, almost unrecognizable as a Star Trek movie. The Klingon's seem thrown in as an afterthought. The whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters.",0

Of course not. Was this movie anything special? Picking on this movie is like picking on a 5 year old for not knowing the alphabet. Is Carrot Top funny?,0

This plot had more holes in it than an OJ Simpson alibi!,0
I don't review movies. I'm not quite sure how to even put it into words. Exercise your brain America! You people that actually got thrills off of this scare me.,0
Exceptionally bad! Did the movie turn comedy right there?,0
This is not a Michael Dorn movie.,0

Of course, a monstrous murderer ( played by Kane ) also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes. Some can't even portray fear properly ; they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote. It's too generic to be scary. And that's sort of the main problem with "" See No Evil "".",0

So what is the point of staying with this drama? Beats the heck out of me.,0

"Oh boy, was I to be DISAPPOINTED.",0
I honestly would just say STAY AWAY.,0
"But, then things get out of hand and getting out alive might be harder than he thought. The title doesn't make any sense either.",0
The death scenes themselves are pretty good and gruesome. It will do little to change your opinion. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. See No Evil is a good example of this. There's really no suspense just some gory death scenes. It was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikable.,0
Probably!,0
It seems to be about nothing.,0
What a nasty cynical film. It is so offensive in its clichéd depictions of obvious and easy targets it was fully rejected by the very audience it was intended. Well the were very wrong.,0

All in all a charmless film that was a waste of time.,0

I recommend going to your local library.,0

"CORRIDORS OF BLOOD < br / > < br / > Aspect ratio : 1. - for a couple of lurid shockers in which good men are thwarted by circumstances beyond their control.

"And when it is not ripping - off other movies, it's boring, and hard to sit through. Simply put, I was amazingly disappointed. A lot.",0
Simply put : This isn't a scary movie! It immediately sets the mood! But there is a main difference!,0
"The mystery element is un - involving and handled with little grace. Even the score feels borrowed and cliché. No! "" The amnesia gimmick is lazy. And The Ghost is a very boring film.",0

"Instead what we got is a glum, mean - spirited, nihilistic, cryptic mare's nest of muddled motives, tangled alliances and back - shootings. And bombings.

Berrigan grows impatient and hires a bunch of thugs to force everyone to vacate. We know Giannini is going to get it and it seemed just a matter of time. He's a fine actor but here he seems to be in over his head. The cast is top notch and they do their best but the whole film comes across as uninspired.,0

The actors are not bad but there is no performance that is touching in any way. I was really looking forward to it and I really wanted it to be good... but it is not. The Downfall was a very good example for a good TV - movie but there was probably some executive or producer who knew what he was doing. The next thing : It is also poorly directed.

Some of the things that happen here I think the real reason why the Airport series stopped here was because Patroni retired after this & the jinx was lifted.,0

She is about as convincing in this role as Pee Wee Herman, and even he would have at least done a better acting job. Riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. Anne Heche deserves special Hall of Shame recognition for her awkward portrayal of a scientist. This was Tommy Lee Jones's turn.",0

"The film examines divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol, and prescription medication as possible reasons for Liz's unhappiness. It is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit. But none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory. No light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in "" The United States of Depression. "" In a key scene in the film, Liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the break - up of the space shuttle Challenger. An excellent cast was wasted, especially in the earnest performance of Christina Ricci.",0

Or watch Girl, Interrupted. Christina Ricci was also good, though her performance seemed a little... stilted. The suicide attempt that was shown in Sterling's office was completely different to the book. That said, if you had read the book, you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken place.",0

"I pretty much agree with him. Thank god I read part of the other review ('twas a little gushy, maybe? )",0

So I went along with it. There was no point to this film at all.,0
Thanks Gus Van Sant... not. big waste of time and money.,0
A gratuitous slow motion shot of * nothing happening. Here's a guy sitting. Get back to work and think of something to say.,0
These actors are horrible. How any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me.,0
it's pretentious garbage. i can't not recommend enough. and that's about it. nothing in this film works.,0

At least I was able to sit through this. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role.,0

Didn't anyone think to maybe arrest him? The teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them, even quite early in the movie. In fact, everyone can see the ghosts.",0
The acting was decent. It does. I cared about the story.,0
"And just as a movie in general, is a big disappointment.",0
"Yup, I was right. Nope, just a crappy movie. Wow, scary! Because he's a man, duh!",0

"This film fails on most of those benchmarks. What else is there? < br / > < br / > Gore? The plot is paper thin, placing a nubile young girl in the jungle among cannibals. The sets are laughable. Jess Franco makes exploitation films, and he has made tons of them.",0

Yeah whatever. And what makes this nun so mean and nasty ( and wet? ),0

Stay away from this garbage.,0
Review : Nunsploitation films. The movie has some nice cinematography. Thats it. Need a reminder of the kind of movies that this company churns out?,0
It'like a horror parody in some points. It turned out to be a teen slasher. Well I was totally wrong.,0
< br / > < br / > But all is not bad. Real screen presence! I must admit that I was quite disappointed because the trailer promised so much more. ). We even get some nice killings too!,0
"In this movie, I will make an exception. Is all Spanish horror films this disappointing?",0
"What gives? heroine to uncover the truth and save the day. However, there are plot holes abound, so don't be looking into the storyline too deeply.",0
This is a stereotype plot. The fights are also shot poorly.,0
"Also, it would have been very simple to make.",0
I hope for their sakes they can all avoid similar humiliations in the future. Macy wisely ducked out the side door and didn't even stick around for the screening. I attended a screening of'The Cooler'at the Toronto Film Festival this year.,0
"I hope so. I might even find something worthwhile to watch in its stead. The dizzy plot? Yet were I to detail its merits, this space would remain blank. If you have seen it already my condolences. Let me count the ways it is bad.",0
This movie is too long ( 140 mins. ),0
"Plus, her husband doesn't notice when $ 30, 000 goes missing from their bank accounts. Far fetched on all counts.",0
I'll rate this mess one point out of 10.,0

Don't expect anything from this movie. The sound!!,0
"He needs to reinvent himself, showing how he can act without yelling. Yeah whatever.",0
The acting was over the top. Cameron Diaz? And this one does. The script was just a joke. It just became a bad MTV video.,0

"6 rating is beyond me. < br / > < br / > The movie tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters, two brothers. Donald "" Shadow "" Rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession.",0
It is pathetic.,0

"Three blokes sit around a table talking and what - not. < br / > < br / > But that's what the film is, it's trash ; it's very brave and shameless trash but trash none - the - less.",0

"Eighteen plus and you begin to lose friends around the water cooler. < br / > < br / > Even then "" Sex Lives... "" it's hard to recommend.",0
"Instead, the producers clearly tried to make up some moronic, difficult to care about, characters. Time after time the same lame reggae chips in to divide scenes, pointlessly and gratingly.

This is one of those films.,0
"Not, I add, when it was shown on screen. Answer : Johnny vegas and Mackenzie Crook.",0
Four out of 10 stars. They call it Vampires : The Turning.,0

The hero can't play. Is that martial arts? Where? This movie is really bad.,0
I wasn't.,0
!,0
This is OK till now. The girl's partner is left to search for her. The script is boring and the actors aren't too talented.,0
Now that's a major drawback when that's the major thrust of the plot. What we don't have is the budget and talent. This film could just as easily have been set in Los Angeles.,0
What is left is muddled and superficial.,0
"Because it doesn't even aspire to be a good vampire movie, VTT fails to deliver any punch that it may have been attempting to. This is just forgettable. It's a cheap way to play your audience, folks. Attractive, but not believable.",0
Will the real George Sluizer please stand up? In fact this might even be the worst ( Sandra Bullock ) movie ever made.,0
Why was it even attempted? George Sluizer's remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time.,0
DUH! The script was lame.,0
They obviously did.,0
The plot is predictable. I can't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb. The dialog is cheesy.,0
"Horah for that, but it really doesn't take much doing. A couple are split apart during a vacation. It's riddled with further annoyances and another blinding continuity blunder. Jeff Bridges'robot accent is another example. < br / > < br / > OK here we go. What is that for?",0
The suspense is very well built - up.,0

What where they thinking?,0
"The script is particularly weak. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the His career never recovered from this disastrous misstep. Me.",0
That is a great film.,0
I seriously fell asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either. Total waste of time and money.,0
"However, DARK WORLD is just the latest in a string of disappointments. The first 90 minutes are very hard to watch. ).",0
Well I was very wrong. The script also felt very contrived.,0
"This movie was bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. Money can't buy everything, but it should in Hollywood! Now it sounds like Shutter Island is doing that. All it told me was "" low budget. """,0
More unrecoverable life time wasted!,0

cast was new.,0
The point is clear. I'd give this film a 1 / 10.,0
"He gives a total crap performance, that bores you to death.",0
But this is with a western touch.,0
"In fact, Central and South America dig soap operas as well, I know that much.",0
It's because of movies like this. What a crappy movie!,0
It was called Hex and a show from BBC. The camera work was non pleasing itself. Perhaps I just don't like his way of speaking or his stature.,0
"Rozema's 1999 adaptation of Mansfield Park is far superior to this ostensibly slightly more faithful film. and her talent simply wasn't suited to the material. Read the novel before or after and make up your own mind. Sir Thomas looked constipated the whole time. The 1999 film is reviled by many Austen purists, but I admire the job Rozema did in making Mansfield Park her own.",0
"For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adaptation might be fine. But only for them. < br / > < br / > Why has it been so hard to do a good adaptation of this book?",0
I really want to forget it. The whole thing feels rather rushed. Why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation?,0
what a mess.,0

You know when you've been painting a wall until you're completely bored? Isn't this somewhat illogical?",0
He was the unnamed producer of this as well. That is the heart of this film. I was in the 5th grade and well remember the huge news for days when that tragedy happened. For that matter neither was Solomon.,0

Let's go through the fact here folks. No I did it with free will. - The acting is an insult to humanity. - The camera - work is low key.,0

"Kyoto, anyone? ? A stupid movie, with a stupid plot.",0

"In the first scene, he wrecks his boat on a sumptuously photographed lake. ( Why don't we see any of this amazing art? )",0
What?,0
Please don't! Family entertainment? The lesson learned? I don't think so. This is no Disney film.,0
"Nope. We put the film on for our 3. 5 year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room. Lots of blood, not just a little. And the photography is quiet nice.",0

It's not. Yah.,0
"It's quite unprofessional, and adds nothing. "", none of it is believable.",0

Does it all really lead back to family? I wasn t so sure.,0
Not any more.,0
But you can enjoy them without this tedious pretentious work.,0
But this film fails on either level in that regard.,0

"The horror continues : - not in the film itself ( pretty ordinary I'm afraid ) but in the Lincoln Rhyme character as played by Mr Washington.

Why is he so impressed with her? The character's are truly awful & I didn't believe any of them were actual human beings. The script by Jeremy Iacone was based on book by Jeffery Deaver & is so poor on so many levels I hardly know where to begin.,0

"This film is the most tasteless and disgraceful Biblical film ever made. I've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film. Newsflash NBC, GOD CAN NOT BE WRONG! The script is so dumb, so pointless, and yes, TOTALLY INACCURATE! Give me a break!",0
"Actually, it's more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screentime. Russo's character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye, but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress'enthusiasm. In the first of many errors and oddities in the movie, that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the film. This film doesn't just have its cake and eat it too ; it has the whole bakery. Bubbling just beneath the surface of Showtime is a good idea. < br / > < br / > With little on screen to keep my attention, my mind began to wander, and that's dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes.",0
"Scenes are re - set from the novel, and lest we forget, Jane Austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. Judy Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. Austen has been Bronteized!",0
"and runs off in tears. However, the beautiful dialogue is ruined when she blubbers, "" Don't you judge me, Elizabeth. She only wants "" a comfortable home. "" Don't you dare judge me! "" Let me begin by saying that I adore the book and loved the A & E miniseries. Very nice. I actually appreciated that scene, simply because I like to see a happy ending, rather than just know that it took place. However, this film scarcely resembles the original book. Charlotte's explanation of why she accepted Mr. Collins'proposal begins beautifully.",0
""". and "" Leave me alone for once in your lives! < br / > < br / > Ugh, the script. Stick to Austen's words ; she did it better than you! I also laughed more at the Bollywood version.",0
"< br / > < br / > It was so obviously trying to be a * serious * film. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. It's about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society.",0
"Wait for the DVD and use to keep a table from wobbling. Huge chunks are missing, the important episode with Wickham is glossed over. < br / > < br / > Quotes from book are thrown in out of context. It has the directorial and scripting skill of Shoreditch.",0
"Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. Where are corsets? He looks also too young to play Mr Darcy. 1 / 3 of the way through I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. < br / > < br / > Not only that, this movie is Boring. He is just bizarre!",0
"It is Historically inaccurate and even the ending is unsatisfying. As if! I went to see suspecting I would hate it, I did. They had servants.",0
Absolutely abysmal - even the too few minutes of Judi Dench cannot save this rubbish. I cannot think of anything good to say about film apart from that it eventually ended!,0
< br / > < br / > And Elizabeth. The latter should set up the prejudice side of things. If it doesn't - don't include it. And the pigs wandering through!,0
"This is an unforgivable liberty with the novel. It is also a commentary on the class structure of Regency Britain. Donald Sutherland is miscast. Brenda Blethyn takes some liberties in making Mrs. Bennet less awful than Austen's portrayal. There are costume and hair problems, too. The gentry would not have been dancing as if they were at a peasant barn dance. The juxtaposition of the two styles is jarring. < br / > < br / > There are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film. Her portrayal is interesting and seems to work.",0
Nothing to really move the story forward. There was a nice score. Hardly. This movie is simply bad. Mickey or Pete. Adults?,0
"Young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother. But like I said before, they don't really go anywhere. Pete's Meteor. Hugh has romance problems because his girlfriend can't get past his cosmic fascination. Not much. < br / > < br / > So the'plot'is disjointed and half of it is pointless.",0
The same thing with other characters. It doesn't work.,0
It's totally weird and impossible to string together.,0
"And where do I begin? Or the VERY bad acted, teen angst innuendo? $ $ $ # @ % @! The zero plot or story?...",0
A very mediocre action movie.,0
!,0
Expression number one : sad. ! Wooden acting. Guys - don't go to see it. There is no plot.,0
It's dead on the screen.,0
Very disappointing for me. Altho it tried hard. More of a serial pilot than an actual movie.,0
For sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job.,0
"The predictable stuff happens. In any public school, these kids would be beaten up every day. < br / > < br / > So what was the movie all about?",0
"The story was so basic that it could have been summed up in about 15 minutes, maximum. At least I hope that was the intention and their taste isn't that bad! Oh yeah Case in point, don't bother with this movie, really, don't.",0
"This was a movie best left on the cutting room floor. < br / > < br / > Hollywood : "" Now that sounds original.",0
"God this movie sucks... where was I? That explains why they got people in their late 20'to play 17 year old's. oh yeah, the ascension part.",0
"The Backstreet Boys, perhaps? And this is one of the teeniest I've seen so far. No one really knows how the Power came to be. Seriously now. Or was it N'Synch? I couldn't. """,0
Wow! The acting really was that bad.,0
Some movies go directly to DVD.,0
"then it could be worth it. or go see it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. your just normal after, right? but don't expect anything breathtaking. - who farted? it was a ford commercial for around 1 / 4th of the movie. Then there was a girl talk PJ party.",0

Rommel was, in fact, a military genius, and by all accounts an upstanding, honest man. < br / > < br / > Mason is fine as Rommel, but it's hardly a memorable performance along the lines of, say, George C. Scott as Patton. If only Hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in Africa, the argument goes, things would have gone very differently.",0
For me this movie was a disappointment. The open holster and the revolver with the mother of pearl grips are clearly visible!,0
Why?,0
This is a stupid movie. To show fortitude?,0
Will they bumble their way through their problems?,0
!,0
It turned out to be quite a pig. Look for something else...,0
"Probably. Anyway, this film is awful. I actually had to leave.",0
Nuff said.,0
The point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. < br / > < br / > It works with good movies too. And that's what makes it great.,0
I just saw this movie. LOL.,0
It's a bunch of junk! Whatever. The movie was pathetic.,0
The plot very closely follows'You've Got Served. ',0
"the actors cannot act. EVER. perhaps i'm being overly critical because i am a dancer, but maybe thats what needs to be heard.",0
"5 rating, I bet it's those Channing lovers! LOL! Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead, and Save the Last Dance?",0
"Then again, that doesn't say much, does it?",0
"Well, not much here in way of horror or suspense. Again, not a bad film to waste a little time that involves NO thinking on. Some of the lines and situations are funny. Indeed, it was not. This film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver.",0
Let'get real here.,0
Some jokes are telegraphed.,0
I'd love to see someone remake this one. It is.,0
"Bergen, although stunning, should NOT put on a British accent EVER. She's not very good at that type of thing.",0
What an utter disappointment.,0
Why they had to fool him? It was a bad film. I'm not saying that anything Yes! I know.,0
It's just a mess.,0
Other than that I can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. < br / > < br / > Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. He's undercover and Murphy is part of his backup.,0
I's a big struggle.,0
Huh. Such pain!,0
I wish I had my money back. What a skunker. The plot is boring and stupid.,0
I was disappointed. Unbelieveable!,0

This horror tale takes place in the Namib Desert of Africa.,0

The other two dimwits are not seen alive again. something eats him. ). Bairstow is supposed to join Camp C and help them find diamonds.",0
Give me break. Pretty cliche eh?,0
But it still didn't surprise me.,0
"One line says it all : "" Who doesn't want to be on TV? "" That's when I saw it in a new light that I hadn't previously noticed. You got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous. < br / > < br / > As for Murphy. Murphy was a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleeting. Early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks : "" How is this different from Cops?",0
This is another Alien imitation and not a very good one at that.,0
I gave it a 4 / 10.,0
"Still it wasn't all bad, it just needed more horror less hunting and more chomping. However, it gets rather boring rather quick at the end.",0
"Wulfsohn tries too hard to make his monster look like the outer space menaces of "" Alien "" and "" Predator "". The ant - creature has infrared - vision and crumbles when shot at, yawn! Avoid. This could have been a modest gem, but instead it'less than mediocre.",0
But they don't. That's it. And we get every monster movie cliché ever made. How about almost non - existent?,0
"It's really not worth the plastic it's made of. Please, for good of humanity. "".",0
Watch at your own risk. The awful attempts at humor - heck the awful attempts at acting. Nobody needs to read a harangue on this piece of junk.,0
I would think you could get that from the title. I can't even remember why I saw this film or when.,0
"Alas, it was not to be. < br / > < br / > But this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic. Why should the audience be expected to care about Kingsley? Simply because he has a goal?",0
Strange movie. or as a dancer on DICK CLARK'S AMERICAN BANDSTAND.,0
"Afterwards they sent him to Siberia. It never should be film in two hours that's impossible. Well, let's think of the book. I'm sorry!",0
The score here is bland too.,0
"Observe, for example, the "" Jessica is lost "" sequence of events. The main attraction, herein, is the Australian scenery. Hero Burlinson discovers damsel. After building a fire, he decides to kiss her.",0
Dreadful!,0
Then there's John Carpenter's Dark Star.,0
The plot here is simple.,0
"What I can not forgive, though, is extreme boredom. Also, don't get fooled by the title, the film is not gory at all. This has the wide reputation of being an awful stinker, and rightly so, I must say. * * * BIG SPOILERS!",0
"What interested hippies? Can't miss, right?",0

"The End. She couldn't have possibly been that washed up. Once upon a time, way back in the 1940's, there lived an actress named Veronica Lake. Really? Unless you're a huge fan of Heather Hughes, run away and never look back!!",0

"All those other movies are bullsh * *! "" Here's what I have to say about it.",0
The ending comes out of nowhere. The movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along. HOW is this funny? That's about as original as this gets. Skip it... unless you're experimental 1960s films.,0
"And her eyes become as painful as boils when she applies makeup? < br / > < br / > Mais je divage. Strikes me as routine, as far as TV movies go. Many people have tried nicotine patch and failed. Why fourteen years?",0
< br / > < br / > This film is great disappointment.,0
What is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish. The only advantage with this sort of film is that it makes you realise how good Goddard Truffaut really are. ).,0
"Almost. Ray and Elliot team up, despite mutual dislike.",0
"Are there any normal characters in the story? Wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex. Well no, of course not!",0
The direction is worse. The movie should've looked a whole lot better.,0
"The climactic (? ) Okay Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the guy who played Macro was handsome. I rated this movie a 3 and that was generous. The scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part is terrible.",0
"As it is, they are little more than cyphers. """,0
"Everything about this movie reeks with improvisation. "" Swope decides to alter the face of American advertising. Each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself.",0
"< br / > < br / > Trivia point. Yes you read that right, a film set in Roman times has a scene with a head chopping giant lawnmower! Well that ` s what you get for renting pirate videos.",0
"There's nothing special about it, just cruelty. Or castration, yeah right, that was fun! But here everything is dark, dull and boring. Fine, but why bother us with it? What? Who really wants to see that? You can say "" Cool! "" The story of an emperor who can't deal with his power "". as you'd say in splatter - slasher - movie. And they are shorter. Real birth scenes, how hilarious!",0
"< br / > < br / > What were these great actors thinking when they got into this. This is not a historic film, it isleaze. ? Even the porn in this movie stinks, and through much of this when I wasn't gagging I was just incredibly bored.",0
"< br / > < br / > How true. Both are terribly awful, of course. ), and I can see why.",0
"I do, however, question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in Roman history. ( That style of movie - making was out of favour in the late seventies ).",0
I know I was.,0
"CALIGULA shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked, decadent manner. Some say that the Rome under Caligula'reign was so brutal. However, it was not that horrific to the middle. Yes, it is true. I hate this film due to many reasons, but particularly one.",0
"complete with a grainy, cheapish photo quality. Have they changed scenes?",0
"Not the least practitioner of these was Caligula. His perversities with his sisters do begin here, if not before. This brings me to reviewing this film. Him seen talking to the statue of Jupiter as an equal doomed him.",0
O'Toole seems to be treating the script with the contempt it deserves ( surely he's in it purely for the money?! The sex in the film isn't used as one aspect in a multi - layered story - the sex IS the story. ).,0
"Rarely has a film proved so boring. We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. In it, sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination.",0
This is only objective this movie achieved.,0
"And no doubt John Gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen. What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.",0
"The way Cooper kept shouting "" Alvin! < br / > < br / > I was totally underwhelmed by the "" acting "".",0
Hardly.,0
and again? there is no there there. he is committed to the performance.,0
"This is one dreary, inert, self - important bore. The difference, however, is that Smith was fun to watch while Capote is not.",0
Probably not.,0
< br / > < br / >bsolute trash.,0
Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves. < br / > < br / > It's really rather messy though.,0
"However, I was utterly disappointed.",0
